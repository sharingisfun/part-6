Ruthless arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with perpetually stoned beach-babe Melanie (Bridget Fonda), teams with his old buddy Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), just released from prison after serving four years for armed robbery. ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he's attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she's going to double-cross the cops. Tarantino commented on the film's budget: &quot;Jackie Brown only cost $12 million. You can't lose. You absolutely, positively can't lose. And you don't have to compromise.&quot; \n\nFile Name .........................................: Jackie Brown.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 3,135,092,736 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:34:23\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x384 (AR: 1.875)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2255 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.340 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese subtitles\n\nQuentin Tarantino - Jackie Brown (1997)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22aa279c72af26f80e7d9fb0695a131915f56266","amp;dn":"Quentin+Tarantino+-+Jackie+Brown+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22aa279c72af26f80e7d9fb0695a131915f56266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,170,39,156,114,175,38,248,14,125,159,176,105,90,19,25,21,245,98,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
