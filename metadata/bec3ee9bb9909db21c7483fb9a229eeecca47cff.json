Its first two parts cover fundamentals and provide specific suggestions for aligning the process with individual needs and goals. \n(These include sections on balancing potential costs and benefits, clarifying objectives, and defining time frames.) \n\nThe final part, which accounts for more than half the book, focuses on implementation through a detailed yet flexible five-step &quot;road map&quot; tied to a company's core processes, key customers, current performance, &quot;high-potential improvement opportunities,&quot; and future practices.
