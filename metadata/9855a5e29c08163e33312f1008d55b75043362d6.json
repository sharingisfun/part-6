The album marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It is consistently placed on 'greatest albums' lists by noted music critics and publications. Robert Christgau called the record &quot;unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard.&quot; In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source Magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums.  A critical, as well as commercial success, the album contains the well known singles, &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;, &quot;The Magic Number&quot;, &quot;Buddy&quot;, and &quot;Eye Know&quot;. On October 23, 2001, the album was re-issued along with an extra disc of B-side tracks, and alternative versions. The album's title was inspired by a line in the Johnny Cash song &quot;Five Feet High and Rising.&quot; The album is discussed in detail by De La Soul in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique. It was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.  The song &quot;Ghetto Thang&quot; is one of the few non-positive tracks on the album. It is a story about poverty and other social ills, even though De La Soul is from middle-class suburb Amityville, New York (on Long Island). Its denunciation of ghetto violence can be summed up in the words &quot;Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways/Now there must be ghetto gangs and ghetto play/If ghetto thing can have its way and get arranged/Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change&quot;. &quot;Description&quot; describes each member of De La Soul, and a few others, in five lines each, the style reminiscent of a limerick.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] The Magic Number\n[03] Change In Speak\n[04] Cool Breeze On The Rocks\n[05] Can U Keep A Secret\n[06] Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin's Revenge)\n[07] Ghetto Thang\n[08] Transmitting Live From Mars\n[09] Eye Know\n[10] Take It Off\n[11] A Little Bit Of Soap\n[12] Tread Water\n[13] Potholes In My Lawn\n[14] Say No Go\n[15] Do As De La Does\n[16] Plug Tunin (Last Chance To Comprehend)\n[17] De La Orgee\n[18] Buddy\n[19] Description\n[20] Me Myself And I\n[21] This Is A Recording 4 Living In A Fulltime Era (L.I.F.E.)\n[22] I Can Do Anything (Delacratic)\n[23] D.A.I.S.Y.
