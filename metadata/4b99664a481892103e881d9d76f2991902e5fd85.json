The easy-to-use reference section provides storage and preservation techniques for the majority of plant produce commonly grown in gardens and allotments.\n\nStoring your garden produce is the key to self-sufficiency because, with less than an acre of garden, you can grow enough produce to feed a family of four for a year. Much of the produce will ripen simultaneously in the summer; without proper storage most of it will go to wasten. Simple and enjoyable techniques for storing your produce are provided so you can embrace the wonderful world of self-sufficiency. In the A-to-Z list of produce, each entry includes recommended varieties, suggested methods of storage, and a number of recipes, from how to make your own cider and pickled gherkins to how to string onions and dry your own apple rings. You'll know where your food has come from, you'll save money, there won't be any packaging, and you'll be eating tasty local food while feeling good about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b99664a481892103e881d9d76f2991902e5fd85","amp;dn":"How+to+Store+Your+Garden+Produce%3A+The++Self-Sufficiency%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b99664a481892103e881d9d76f2991902e5fd85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,153,102,74,72,24,146,16,62,136,29,157,118,242,153,25,2,229,253,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
