The Road contains ten songs, including first single &quot;Endless Summer,&quot;\nwhich CMT has hailed as &quot;the anthem of the Summer of 2012.&quot; It also contains the\nRhett Akins/Dallas Davidson/Bobby Pinson-penned &quot;Granddaddy's Gun,&quot; marking the\nfirst time in Lewis' entire career that he has cut a song he didn't have a hand\nin writing.\n\nThe songs that make up The Road mirror the country roots of Lewis' childhood.\n&quot;This music and these songs represent who I am and where I come from,&quot; says\nLewis, who still resides in rural western Massachusetts.\n&quot;I hope people hear the record and realize that this is all me,&quot; Lewis says of\nthe songs on The Road. &quot;I'm writing songs about who I am and where I am, just\nlike I've done my whole career. The setting for the songs might be different but\nthey're as honest as anything I've ever done.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c4f0de29ae0b04ddedd888328b85c99a0af83c","amp;dn":"Aaron_Lewis-The_Road-2012-404+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c4f0de29ae0b04ddedd888328b85c99a0af83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,196,240,222,41,174,11,4,221,237,216,136,50,139,133,201,154,10,248,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
