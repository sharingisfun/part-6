Each chapter first presents an initial concept, which details a proven method, before providing hands-on tutorials and projects. This approach details how and why animation techniques work and explains how to use Maya for creating sophisticated, state-of-the-art animations. The author distills real-world experience into helpful hints and step-by-step guides for common tasks.\n\nMore About the Author\nJohn Edgar Park is an author, maker, animation filmmaker, technical/artistic problem solver, educator, TV host, builder of quirky electro-mechanical contraptions, husband, and father of two.\n\nJohn has worked as a 3D artist, character rigger, and CG supervisor for games, visual effects, and animated feature films since 1994 at such studios as Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Sony Imageworks. He is currently the Director of Digital Production &amp; Technology at Disneytoon Studios, overseeing CG filmmaking and technology research and development on such films as Disney's Planes, Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue, and the Disney Fairies.\n\nJohn has taught Maya at Sony Pictures Imageworks, Disney, The Animation Guild Local 839, Friedman 3D, and Studio Arts.\n\nHe's the co-founder of the hardware peripheral company WingShield Industries, and co-creator of its premiere offering, the ScrewShield for Arduino.\n\nJohn hosted the American Public Television show Make: television and has presented talks at many Maker Faires. He writes for Make: magazine, Boing Boing, Cool Tools and other places online and in print, including authoring the book Understanding 3D Animation Using Maya.\n\nJohn's obsessions include coffee roasting/brewing/making/drinking, robots, tools, beatboxing, sharing self-portraiture, and admittedly strange human body tricks. His control of individual face muscles led to his use as the baseline calibration model for facial motion capture systems and rigs in many visual effects movies.\n\nISBN 0-387-00176-X (softcover : alk. paper)\n1.
