The pair returned this year with a new release, 'Stage 2,' and will follow that with Drop the Vowels on March 31.\n\n&quot;Produced fast and loose through late 2013 / early 2014,&quot; the record is described in its press release as &quot;an album that recalls the strict and stripped funk of Anthony Shakir as much as it does LeilaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible debut 'Like Weather,' eschewing the dark aesthetic both producers are best known for in favour of something much more visceral. It's an album borne from a love of both pop and club music, made to evoke an adrenalised, hedonistic, as well as an emotional response.&quot;\n\nAlthough most of the material on Drop the Vowels is new, it does include revisions of 'Temper Tantrum' and 'Spectral Source,' previously released on the Millie &amp; Andrea 12&quot;s.\n\nTrack listing:\n01.
