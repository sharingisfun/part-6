But as a band whose every blistering riff and leather-clad swagger looms large with the otherworldly essence of heavy metal, the theatrical vision with which Judas PriestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closing Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ date is captured only heightens their already towering stage presence.\n\nIn a sustained, 142-minute assault on the senses that sees these genre-forging Brits revisit their immense 14-album discography, this rare performance is rendered with all the explosive audio and acrobatic camera angles youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect of such an outing. But with every era of Judas PriestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 40-year career being recreated in the iconic visuals that define each influential album, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is no simple retrospective and, as such demands ample cinematic imagination. With its lingering close-ups and whirling overhead shots being ignited in a white-hot haze of light, Ã¢â‚¬ËœStarbreakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is particularly abuzz with fan euphoria, with Rob HalfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operatic pipes ricocheting off expansive surround sound audio.\n\nJudas PriestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary musicianship is always a supreme spectacle to behold in any medium, but never before has the passion and pageantry of their sound been so vividly brought to life until now.\n[4/5] Faye Coulman\n\nBecause Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is such a monumental milestone for Judas Priest, marking their 40th anniversary as recording artists, we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn down the opportunity to talk to the metal god himself, Rob Halford, about Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nThe Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ set covers every era of Priest, what went into picking the setlist?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really listened to PriestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s [back catalogue] completely for the longest time so I literally played everything, absolutely every track and [laughs] you surprise yourself, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœoh that was a good one, iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d forgot about thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcos it was buried on side two of Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoint Of EntryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or whatever. And then, of course, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to have a track from Ã¢â‚¬ËœPainkillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which you can play live, every track off Ã¢â‚¬ËœBritish SteelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which you could play live, Ã¢â‚¬ËœScreaming For VengeanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and on and on and on.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIs it fair to say that the Ã¢â‚¬ËœEpitaphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tour, and this DVD, marks the end of a chapter for Priest?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Just in one small respect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the end of Judas Priest by any stretch of the imagination; weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the studio now as we speak tracking all of the new material; weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just cutting back a little bit so we can still get out there and do the great shows that we want to do. As a 52-year-old metal head [laughs], going out doing what I need to do as a singer and as a performer, I can still do it and I love to do it. I just want to be able to go out there and not look sad and punch drunk and I think that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just kind of look at what you need to do to make sure that when people see you, they go Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyeah, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re as good as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever beenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Battle HymnRapid Fire.mp3\n02 - Metal Gods.mp3\n03 - Heading Out to the Highway.mp3\n04 - Judas Rising.mp3\n05 - Starbreaker.mp3\n06 - Victim of Changes.mp3\n07 - Never Satisfied.mp3\n08 - Diamonds and Rust.mp3\n09 - Prophecy.mp3\n10 - Night Crawler.mp3\n11 - Turbo Lover.mp3\n12 - Beyond the Realms of Death.mp3\n13 - The Sentinel.mp3\n14 - Blood Red Skies.mp3\n15 - The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown).mp3\n16 - Breaking the Law.mp3\n17 - Painkiller.mp3\n18 - The HellionElectric Eye.mp3\n19 - Hell Bent for Leather.mp3\n20 - You've Got Another Thing Coming.mp3\n21 - Living After Midnight.mp3\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: England\nGenre: Heavy Metal,speed metal\n\n\nMedia Report:\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aababcb20cc2294530fcd4aba31df633e078ed39","amp;dn":"%282013%29+Judas+Priest+-+Epitaph+%5B320+kbps%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aababcb20cc2294530fcd4aba31df633e078ed39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,186,188,178,12,194,41,69,48,252,212,171,163,29,246,51,224,120,237,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
