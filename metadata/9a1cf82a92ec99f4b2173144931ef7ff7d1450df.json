After returning home from a club where he was DJing, he and his friend were assaulted, robbed, and knocked unconscious. Dregen suffered a broken jaw but the band continued recording their next album; Stockholm Syndrome. The album, released in 2003, was viewed by some fans as a return towards a more energetic and raw sound. The album won them a Swedish Grammy. The album spawned three singles, Minus Celsius, A Song For The Outcast, and Friends. (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nBackyard Babies - Stockholm syndrome 2003\n(Solna RCA/BMG)\n\n 1. Everybody ready?!\n 2.
