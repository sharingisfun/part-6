The smoked-out 'Fallen Arches' could almost be some lost 70s astral jazz-funk oddyssey, with its conga-heavy groove and bluesy piano chords. The two jams featuring Gavin Turek, 'Little Pleasures' and 'Darkest (Dim)', are out-and-out trip-pop - TOKi's sublimely love-stung vocals coated in a lovely Balearic shimmer - and if this was the 90s they'd already have been licensed to a million chill-out compilations (we mean that as a compliment). 'Bright Shadows' heads for computer-diced 2-step territory, but the unusually rootsy, psychedelic vibe that characterises this whole EP remains very much in place. Of the seven tracks, 'Moving Forward' is probably our fave, being a heavily dubbed arrangement of tumbling tribal drums, cinematic synth-strings and helicoptering 16-bit arpeggios. Really impressive, forward-thinking stuff throughout, and for us one of the best things Brainfeeder have ever released. Recommended.&quot;\n\n 01 Fallen Arches\n 02 Little Pleasures (feat.
