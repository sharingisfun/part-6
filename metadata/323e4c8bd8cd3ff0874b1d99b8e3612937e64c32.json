Fun Lovin&amp;#039; Criminals - Come Find Yourself (1996)\n\n\nThe Fun Lovin&amp;#039; Criminals made something that I guarantee you haven&amp;#039;t quite heard before. If you go back to &amp;#039;96 you may recall some hit singles &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot; &amp; &quot;Fun Lovin&amp;#039; Criminal&quot;, two hip-hopish songs that crossed into the alternative rock mainstream at the time.\nFLC is made up of 3 New Yorkers and you can tell how the NYC life is injected into their song stlyes of hip-hop beats and lyrics with a touch of dark bluesy rock. The best way I can describe this music when you hear it is... it makes you wanna kick-back and chill.\n\n\n01. The Fun Lovin&amp;#039; Criminal                       \n02.

Fun Lovin&amp;#039; Criminals - 100% Colombian (1999)\n\n\n&quot;100% Colombian&quot; took a little bit to get used to, cause rythems are a little jazzier and slower here. But you&amp;#039;ll love it quickly. Besides, you get these bursts of hip-hop/rock/blues anthems like &quot;All For Self&quot;, you hear it and you just feel like your the boss.\n\n\n01.
