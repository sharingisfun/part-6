The only constant factor was guitarist Neal Schon (born February 27, 1954), a music prodigy who had been a member of Santana in 1971-1972. The original unit, which was named in a contest on KSAN-FM in San Francisco, featured Schon, bassist Ross Valory, drummer Prairie Prince (replaced by Aynsley Dunbar), and guitarist George Tickner (who left after the first album). Another former Santana member, keyboard player and singer Gregg Rolie, joined shortly afterward. This lineup recorded Journey (1975), the first of three moderate-selling jazz-rock albums given over largely to instrumentals.\n\nBy 1977, however, the group decided it needed a strong vocalist/frontman and hired Steve Perry (born January 22, 1949). The results were immediately felt on the fourth album, Infinity (1978), which sold a million copies within a year. (By this time, Dunbar had been replaced by Steve Smith.) Evolution (1979) was similarly successful, as was Departure (after which Rolie was replaced by Jonathan Cain). Following a live album, Captured (1981), Journey released Escape, which broke them through to the top ranks of pop groups by scoring three Top Ten hit singles, all ballads highlighting Perry's smooth tenor: &quot;Who's Crying Now,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop Believin',&quot; and &quot;Open Arms.&quot; The album topped the charts and sold millions. Frontiers (1983), featuring the hit &quot;Separate Ways,&quot; was another big success, after which Perry released a double-platinum solo album, Street Talk (1984). When the group got back together to make a new album, Valory and Smith were no longer in the lineup and Raised on Radio (1986) was made by Schon, Perry, and Cain, who added other musicians for a tour.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tCBS/Columbia\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\n02.Send Her My Love\n03.Chain Reaction\n04.After The Fall\n05.Faithfully\n06.Edge Of The Blade\n07.Troubled Child\n08.Back Talk\n09.Frontiers\n10.Rubicon\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaa5dcf1098302bf40dc84c10c99d7f4d78169f2","amp;dn":"Journey+-+Frontiers+%281983%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaa5dcf1098302bf40dc84c10c99d7f4d78169f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,165,220,241,9,131,2,191,64,220,132,193,12,153,215,244,215,129,105,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
