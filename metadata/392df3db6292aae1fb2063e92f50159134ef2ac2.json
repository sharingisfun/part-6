But what if this transcendent level of intelligence brings with it a ruthless megalomania?\r\n\r\nDavid Desh left the special forces after his team was brutally butchered in Iran. Now he has been reactivated for one last mission: find Kira Miller, the enigmatic genius behind a bioterror plot that threatens millions. But when Desh learns that the bioterror plot is just the tip of the iceberg, he is thrust into a byzantine maze of deception and intrigue, and he becomes a key player in a deadly game he can't begin to understand. A game that is certain to have a dramatic impact on the future course of human history. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Peter Berkrot\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392df3db6292aae1fb2063e92f50159134ef2ac2","amp;dn":"Douglas+E.+Richards+-+Wired+%28Wired+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392df3db6292aae1fb2063e92f50159134ef2ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,45,243,219,98,146,170,225,251,32,99,233,47,80,21,145,52,239,42,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
