The chapter structure has been completely revamped, with more emphasis on the features that users request to get up and running quickly. This includes a new introductory chapter on editing in five easy steps and more comprehensive coverage on handling Camera Raw images from DSLR shooters. This fully updated edition includes: concise, step-by-step instructions; hundreds of carefully edited full color photographs; screen captures of program features; supplemental tips and sidebars; and a thorough table of contents and index. This guide for both Windows and Mac OS X follows the integration of the Elements 10 software with parallel features for both platforms.\n\n\n\nBy: Jeff Carlson\n\nPublisher: Peachpit Press\n\nPub.
