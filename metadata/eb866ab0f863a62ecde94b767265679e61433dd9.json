Gray's origins are somewhat ill-defined; different sources alternately list his birth name as Leonard Victor Ainsworth or Laurence Darrow Brown, and his Texas birthplace as Brookshire or Simonton. His likely birth date is July 26, 1940 (though some sources list 1942 or 1943). Whatever the case, Gray grew up in a family of sharecroppers, and discovered gospel music through his grandfather, a Baptist minister. He also soaked up the R&amp;B and country music of his surroundings, and in the early '60s he moved to Los Angeles to seek his fortune. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.62% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tHip-O\nCatalog:\t\t541490\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n01.The In Crowd\n02.See You At The Go-Go\n03.Look At Me\n04.Out On The Floor\n05.Honey, You Can't Take It Back\n06.Rose Garden\n07.Drift Away\n08.The Time I Loved You The Most\n09.Good Old Song\n10.Love Is On The Line\n11.Loving Arms\n12.So High (Rock Me Baby And Roll Me Away)\n13.Watch Out For Lucy\n14.A New Ray Of Sunshine\n15.You Can Do It\n16.Got My Heart Set On You\n17.If I Ever Needed You\n18.That's One To Grow On\n19.Let Me Go Till I'm Gone\n20.Uptown Saturday Night\n21.No Room To Cry (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb866ab0f863a62ecde94b767265679e61433dd9","amp;dn":"Dobie+Gray+-+Ultimate+Collection+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb866ab0f863a62ecde94b767265679e61433dd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,134,106,176,248,99,166,46,205,233,75,118,114,101,103,158,97,67,61,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
