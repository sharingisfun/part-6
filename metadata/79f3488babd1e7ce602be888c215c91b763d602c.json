Rao, A.K. Sood (Wiley-VCH, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nSince its discovery in 2004, graphene has been a great sensation due to its unique structure and unusual properties, and it has only taken\r\n6 years for a Noble Prize to be awarded for the field of graphene research. This monograph gives a well-balanced overview on all areas of\r\nscientific interest surrounding this fascinating nanocarbon. In one handy volume it offers comprehensive coverage of the topic, including\r\nchemical, materials science, nanoscience, physics, engineering, life science, and potential applications. Other graphene-like, inorganic layered materials are also discussed.\r\n\r\nEdited by two highly honored scientists, this is an invaluable companion for inorganic, organic, and physical chemists, materials scientists,\r\nand physicists.\r\n\r\nFrom the Contents:\r\n\r\n* Synthesis, Characterization, and Selected Properties of Graphene\r\n* Understanding Graphene via Raman Scattering\r\n* Physics of Quanta and Quantum Fields in Graphene\r\n* Graphene and Graphene-Oxide-Based Materials for Electrochemical Energy Systems\r\n* Heterogeneous Catalysis by Metal Nanoparticles supported on Graphene\r\n* Graphenes in Supramolecular Gels and in Biological Systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f3488babd1e7ce602be888c215c91b763d602c","amp;dn":"Graphene+-+Synthesis%2C+Properties%2C+and+Phenomena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f3488babd1e7ce602be888c215c91b763d602c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,243,72,139,171,209,231,206,96,43,232,136,194,21,201,27,118,61,96,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
