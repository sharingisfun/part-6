IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve walked from pawn to player and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll win this game of ours, though the cost of it may drown the world in bloodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe land burns with the fires of a hundred battles as lords and petty kings fight for the Broken Empire. The long road to avenge the slaughter of his mother and brother has shown Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath the hidden hands behind this endless war. He saw the game and vowed to sweep the board. First though he must gather his own pieces, learn the rules of play, and discover how to break them.\n\nA six nation army, twenty thousand strong, marches toward Jorg's gates, led by a champion beloved of the people. Every decent man prays this shining hero will unite the empire and heal its wounds. Every omen says he will. Every good king knows to bend the knee in the face of overwhelming odds, if only to save their people and their lands. But King Jorg is not a good king.\n\nFaced by an enemy many times his strength Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight. But playing fair was never part of JorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game plan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6bf24a7d53db78093c30aa77b588233ca57163","amp;dn":"King+of+Thorns+-+Mark+Lawrence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6bf24a7d53db78093c30aa77b588233ca57163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,107,242,74,125,83,219,120,9,60,48,170,119,181,136,35,60,165,113,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
