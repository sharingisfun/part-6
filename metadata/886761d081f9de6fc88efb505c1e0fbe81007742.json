There is rarely a concert by the trio that does not have at least one new piece by the exciting contemporary Dutch composer Chiel Meijering.\r\nThis album is in response to all those fans of the trio who have requested recordings of Meijering's work.\r\nIt is a selection from the 20-odd works that Meijering wrote for the Amsterdam Guitar Trio in the period 1980-1989. Of the seven works on this album, five were presented by the Trio on their 1987 concert tour, which featured an all-Meijering program accompanied by viola player Esther Apituley and soundscape composer Floris van Manen.&quot;\r\n\r\n1.
