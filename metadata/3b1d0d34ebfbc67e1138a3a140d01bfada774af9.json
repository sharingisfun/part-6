The Band, the group's second album, was a more deliberate and even more accomplished effort, partially because the players had become a more cohesive unit, and partially because guitarist Robbie Robertson had taken over the songwriting, writing or co-writing all 12 songs. Though a Canadian, Robertson focused on a series of American archetypes from the union worker in &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot; and the retired sailor in &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot; to, most famously, the Confederate Civil War observer Virgil Cane in &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.&quot; The album effectively mixed the kind of mournful songs that had dominated Music from Big Pink, here including &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; and &quot;When You Awake&quot; (both co-written by Richard Manuel), with rollicking uptempo numbers like &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; (both sung by Levon Helm and released as singles, with &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; making the Top 40). As had been true of the first album, it was The Band's sound that stood out the most, from Helm's (and occasionally Manuel's) propulsive drumming to Robertson's distinctive guitar fills and the endlessly inventive keyboard textures of Garth Hudson, all topped by the rough, expressive singing of Manuel, Helm, and Rick Danko that mixed leads with harmonies. The arrangements were simultaneously loose and assured, giving the songs a timeless appeal, while the lyrics continued to paint portraits of 19th century rural life (especially Southern life, as references to Tennessee and Virginia made clear), its sometimes less savory aspects treated with warmth and humor.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8czuvHg981qevwryo1_1344299168_cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8czuvHg981qevwryo1_1344299168_cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nAcross the Great Divide - 2:53\nRag Mama Rag - 3:04\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - 3:33\nWhen You Awake - 3:13 (Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson)\nUp on Cripple Creek - 4:34\nWhispering Pines - 3:58 (Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson)\nJemima Surrender - 3:31 (Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson)\nRockin' Chair - 3:43\nLook Out Cleveland - 3:09 (Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson)\nJawbone - 4:20 (Richard Manuel)\nThe Unfaithful Servant - 4:17\nKing Harvest (Has Surely Come) - 3:39\n\nBonus Track nella ristampa del 2000\n\nGet Up Jake (outtake - stereo mix) - 2:17\nRag Mama Rag (alternate vocal take - rough mix) - 3:05\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (alternate mix) - 4:16\nUp on Cripple Creek (alternate take) - 4:51\nWhispering Pines (alternate take) - 5:09\nJemima Surrender (alternate take) - 5:09\nKing Harvest (Has Surely Come) (alternate arrangement) - 4:28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b1d0d34ebfbc67e1138a3a140d01bfada774af9","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+The+Band+%281969%29+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b1d0d34ebfbc67e1138a3a140d01bfada774af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,29,13,52,235,251,198,126,17,56,163,161,64,208,27,250,218,119,74,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
