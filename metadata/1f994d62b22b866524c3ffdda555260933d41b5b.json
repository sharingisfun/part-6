She had never before considered making her own peanut butter and pita bread, let alone curing her own prosciutto or raising turkeys. And though it sounded logical that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdoing it yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ would cost less, she had her doubts. So Reese began a series of kitchen-related experiments, taking into account the competing demands of everyday contemporary American family life as she answers some timely questions: When is homemade better? Cheaper? Are backyard eggs a more ethical choice than store-bought? Will grinding and stuffing your own sausage ruin your week? Is it possible to make an edible maraschino cherry? Some of ReeseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s discoveries will surprise you: Although you should make your hot dog buns, guacamole, and yogurt, you should probably buy your hamburger buns, potato chips, and rice pudding. Tired? Buy your mayonnaise. Inspired? Make it. With its fresh voice and delightful humor, Make the Bread, Buy the Butter gives 120 recipes with eminently practical yet deliciously fun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMake or buyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recommendations. Reese is relentlessly entertaining as she relates her food and animal husbandry adventures, which amuse and perplex as well as nourish and sustain her family. Her tales include living with a backyard full of cheerful chickens, muttering ducks, and adorable baby goats; countertops laden with lacto-fermenting pickles; and closets full of mellowing cheeses. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the full picture of what is involved in a truly homemade lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the good news that you shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try to make everything yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how to get the most out of your time in the kitchen.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f994d62b22b866524c3ffdda555260933d41b5b","amp;dn":"Make+the+Bread%2C+Buy+the+Butter%3A+What+You+Should+and+Shouldn%5C%27t+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f994d62b22b866524c3ffdda555260933d41b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,153,77,98,178,43,134,101,36,195,255,221,165,85,38,9,51,212,27,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
