It was carefully remastered using High Quality Hard- and Software. There's no clipping. \r\n\r\nI'm an audiophile High-End HiFi Enthusiast, who tries to make good, old, classic Metal music sound more &quot;real&quot;, &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;, without using shitty EQ or any sort of cheap Compressors. \r\n\r\nCompression is cancer, so I tried to improve the songs step by step. Of course, there is no clipping.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and give me some Feedback if you guys want more audiophile remasters.\r\n\r\nSource: CD, slowly ripped with NAIM UnitiServe. NAIM DAC. NAIM Amps. Xavian Speakers. Carbon Cables from Audioquest. Clean, filtered AC.\r\n\r\nAIFF, 16 Bit, 1411 kBit/s\r\n\r\nHD-Cover included. \r\n\r\nHave fun and kick ass!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55cf7f834a13c7645d5015fc9e148787d1107ac5","amp;dn":"Manowar+Fighting+The+World+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55cf7f834a13c7645d5015fc9e148787d1107ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,207,127,131,74,19,199,100,93,80,21,252,158,20,135,135,209,16,122,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
