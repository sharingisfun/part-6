It wasn't just their crushingly loud interpretation of the blues -- it was how they incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) -- into their sound. Led Zeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested the band. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. More than any other band, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as singles. In doing so, they established the dominant format for heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound. ~ Allmusic\nLive performance at Earls Court Arena is a strong entry in the long list of Zeppelin bootlegs. Recorded May 24th, 1975, the repertoire includes compositions from each of four albums: Led Zeppelin III, IV, Houses of the Holy, and Physical Graffiti.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Rock and Roll - 4:15\n2.
