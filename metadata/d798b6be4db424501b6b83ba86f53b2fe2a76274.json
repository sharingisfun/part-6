You could even argue that modern music just isn't good enough. As evidence consider this: contemporary producers and artists are often looking back to get inspired - insert staggering number of examples - so you can safely say that even in this digital age the beating heart of modern R&amp;B and hip-hop is still vintage soul, funk and jazz. \n\nThis is why BBE Records have teamed up with DJ/Producer Mr Thing, to dig deep into his extensive collection to compile a series of albums of rare and sought after breaks. This series reflects brilliantly on his dedication to digging for those untouched and unrivalled samples and breaks as you hear him use in his DJ sets. As a DJ, Mr Thing never fails to engage the crowd with his winning combination of hip hop and funk breaks, spiced up with his legendary mixing and scratching skills. \n\nThe first installment in the five part &quot;Strange Breaks &amp; Things&quot; series contains superb songs; some you've probably never heard of, some which may make you go: &quot;I recognize this sample!&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦because it was once used as the backdrop for a classic Hip Hop track. If you liked the legendary &quot;Strange Games&quot; compilation series on BBE compiled by the likes of Kenny Dope &amp; DJ Spinna, you'll love &quot;Strange Breaks &amp; Mr Thing&quot;.\n\nVolume II\n\nAfter many succesful 'Strange' series (remember those classic Strange Games and Things compilations?) it is about time BBE released a sequal to &quot;Strange Breaks&quot;. The successor is called &quot;Strange Breaks &amp; Mr. Thing Vol. 2&quot; and is set to release tomorrow as a digital release. For those who don't know...Mr. Thing scratches shit up like an angry hooker in a catfight. Eighteen of the best kept breaks are mixed together for your listening pleasure just to give you a taste. If you want to own each and every single one of these rarities, be sure to buy this sick ass compilation. \n\nVolume III\n\nFive years on from the last, BBE is proud to present the next instalment of Strange Breaks &amp; Mr Thing. In this digital age the beating heart of modern R&amp;B and hip-hop remains as vintage soul, funk and jazz. Like the previous volumes, Strange Breaks &amp; Mr Thing III contains a collection of killer cutz; some you've probably never heard of, some which may make you go: &quot;I recognize this sample!&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ because it was once used as the backdrop for a classic Hip Hop track. If you liked the legendary &quot;Strange Games&quot; compilation series on BBE compiled by the likes of Kenny Dope &amp; DJ Spinna, you'll love &quot;Strange Breaks &amp; Mr. Thing&quot;. \nUK Hip-Hop producer and acclaimed DJ; Mr. Thing has been busier than ever circling the globe, filling dance floors as well as adding rare 45s to his ever growing collection now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shaing those nuggets with us. \nKnown worldwide as a DJ &amp; turntablist Mr Thing is a name synonymous with Hip-Hop that always brings a smile to the faces of fans and promoters alike as they remember genius performances of impeccable skill.
