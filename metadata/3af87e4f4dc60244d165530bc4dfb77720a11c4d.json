This is not &quot;warez&quot;, no files are &quot;cracked&quot; in this OS and everything is guaranteed virusfree. (And yes, that includes cmdow.exe: http://www.commandline.co.uk/cmdow/) Don't pay for this download. Don't trust other sources of this OS. Upload was done on ThePiratebay,and demonoid.\n\n\nThis is a clean SECURE thoroughly tested A/V &amp; IT Expert's version of XP64.\nBuilt upon Windows XP Professional x64 Edition retail SP2 (NT 5.2.3790.3959).\nWith inline *corporate* Volume License Key, so this release passes the\n&quot;Windows Genuine Advantage&quot; checks, and a product key is NOT needed (see\n\\AMD64\\WINNT.SIF on the iso if you need the key for Virtual installs). Have\na key of your own?  Try this: &lt;a href=&quot; http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/old.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/old.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWindows XP x64 supports up to 128GB of RAM !\nThis Windows version is designed to work with 64-bit processors from AMD and\nIntel that support the x64 extensions to the x86 architecture. These include\nAthlon 64, Athlon 64 FX, Mobile Athlon 64, Turion 64, Opteron processors from\nAMD, and all Xeon, Pentium 4, Dual, Quad &amp; 8 Core Intel setups with EM64T.\n\nThis XP is Multilingual User Interface ready (ALL Languages/Keyboard types!),\nand is more complete than earlier releases, including Outlook Express and IE8 !\nIf you are a beginner, at least make sure your system is really safe:\nhttps://www.xs4all.nl/en/veiligheid/checklist/\nThis XP64 is intended for those who - like us - prefer a Classic minimal\napproach, those who prefer OpenOffice, do audio- or video-editing, creative\nand developing work, and/or those who generally wouldn't share their PC/laptop\nwith other users. You can however create new users and switch between them.\nIf you're the type that feels at home being Administrator\n*all the time*, then this will be a Superior OS for you.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (read before installing!)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBurn the .iso Image-file to DVD at 4 X speed or slower,  use &lt;a href=&quot; http://ImgBurn.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ImgBurn.com&lt;/a&gt;\nNo need to unpack anything, just burn the file directly, it's a boot-disc image.\n\n( SHA1 of sxp64_revival.iso:  d9352319111244b40ac382f3736bdfcefbb4fb4a\n  you can use http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/ to check this )\n\nA fresh Install is recommended. Repair or Upgrade of existing Windows installs\nhas not been tested, but functionality for running setup.exe is 100% available!\n\nPower on your PC/laptop, press the button for the system to enter BIOS.\nMake sure your mainboard BIOS Version is up-to-date.\nSet Power Management (ACPI) to Enabled in BIOS.\n\nChange the Boot sequence to DVD (CDROM) first, then Save and Exit BIOS.\n\n'Press any key' when asked to boot with the DVD, and after about 5 minutes\nyou should  Quick-Format  the desired storage partition for SXP64 to  NTFS.\n\n-&gt; You only need to boot from DVD once, DON'T Press a key at the next boot !\n\n-&gt; You will be prompted for the Regional Settings. ALL files for Keyboards,\n   internationalization, input-languages are available, MUI support available!\n\n-&gt; Don't take out your DVD before installation is finished. Give the computer\n   sufficient time to decide what it must do, a good setup takes some time.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nIf you want to put SXP64 on a SSD, make sure you pre-align the partition:\nhttp://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showpost.php?p=326656&amp;postcount=3\n(Do this *before* you use the SXP64 install DVD..)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIs this version of XP really &quot;Superior&quot; to others ?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you buy XP x64 Edition from Microsoft you'll get a rather old CD. So you\ngo to the Windows Update website and find out you need to update your system\nwith hundreds of patches, new drivers and so on. This update-process creates a\nlot of extra slack on your harddisk, backups of previous versions of numerous\nsystem-files and drivers, and roll-back options you'll never use, remain there.\nSuperior XP (SXP64) already has the latest versions of system-files built-IN,\nALL official XP x64 updates released until June 10 2009 are fully integrated!\nSome parts of the original Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition were\nbound to go wrong for most users, or were never being used, so these facts have\nbeen considered creating SXP64, causing the removal of many files and updating\nof the registry. All is improved in so many ways that it warranted a freshly\ncreated install image to get better speeds and a more reliable daily workflow.\nIf your CPU and motherboard support x64 (64 bit), then this might\nvery well be the fastest Desktop/Workstation system you can find!\n\nWhat also makes this install-image superior is the fact that many storage media\ncontroller drivers are already integrated. This means you can install this OS\ndirectly on new RAID/S-ATA/AHCI and SSD hardware without trouble or errors.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADDED ITEMS &amp; FEATURES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI n t e g r a t e d  (pre-installed) into this XP64 release :\n\n- Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10, with add-ons ConfigMania and AdBlockPlus\n- Flash-player\n- Shockwave\n- Sun Java JRE 6u14 i586 &amp; x64\n\n- Internet Explorer 8 (plus all security updates and some settings we prefer)\n\n- Windows Media Player 11\n  plus IE8 and Firefox plugins, extra smooth/safe with tweaks.\n\n- Quicktime Lite 2.90\n\n- K-Lite Codec Pack (klmcodec485)\n\n- PSPad (5/12/2009) -&gt; Brilliant freeware Text Editor, replacing Notepad.\n                       Better than Editpad, textpad, notepad2 or notepad++\n                     ( notepad.exe is still there, under folder \\Base\\ )\n\n- Total Commander 7.04a (king of filemanagers, with 7zip and iso-mount plugins)\n\n- WinRAR 3.9 x64\n\n- JKDefrag64 (replaces the Disk Defragmentation tool from MS)\n\n- ERUNT -&gt; Auto-backups state of registry, this crucial tool in essence\n  replaces System Restore, and works a LOT better! Info on using ERUNT:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/erunt.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/erunt.txt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- Autoruns (right-click My Computer) -&gt; Much better than using MSConfig\n\n- PuTTy -&gt; 64 bit SSH client, replacing telnet and hyperterminal.\n\n- DirectX 9.26.1590 (64 bit &amp; 32 bit)\n  Note that DirectX 10 for XP64 (plus a 9-10 Switcher tool)\n  can be found via the \\Superior\\ folder on your Desktop !\n\n- Cool Themes ( the Themes service needs to be started ) ..\n  * Embedded Theme from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWindows Embedded Standard CTP Refresh.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n  * Energy Blue Theme Pack from Kelsenellenelvian's True Royale Addon.\n  * Royale Noir from Kelsenellenelvian's Royale Noir addon.\n  * Tablet PC Style adapted from MrNxDmX's Tablet PC Style Energy Blue Theme\n    Addon Pack with WMP10 Skin &amp; Fedora Inverse.\n  * Zune Theme from ricktendo64's Zune Theme addon.\n  * Windows Aero Shadow mouse pointer scheme from Windows Vista.\n  (note that wallpapers have been replaced by some of our own)\n\n  UXTheme.dll has been patched, you can install any theme you want!\n\n- Some more gorgeous unique Desktop Wallpapers included.\n\n- Useful extra Fonts and Cursors!\n  We really LOVE these effective and lightweight cursors. And we work with this\n  font-set because these are the ones we prefer. We've seen too many systemfonts\n  not to know what's best for us. We also think the desktop background is really\n  cool and warm and has depth. We don't want fancy-ass useless bullshit on our\n  screens, we need our machines to work for us, deliver quality and save time,\n  not be paintings on the wall. So, still think we could give a rats ass about\n  YOUR taste? Please design your own OS and push out your (ugly) preferences.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nD R I V E R S\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAny driver available for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition works in SXP64.\nSOME drivers, BUT NOT ALL, are included and compatible hardware is checked\nduring installation.
