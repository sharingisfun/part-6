The author describes how to fold the modules and how to use them as building blocks to construct larger polyhedral models. These beautiful designs are elaborate three-dimensional geometric patterns, some resembling stars or flowers. One chapter focuses on models representing mutually intersecting planes in the shape of stars, hexagons, etc. Some of the models are advanced variations of favorite models from the author s previous book, Marvelous Modular Origami. The folding diagrams are clear, crisp, and easy to follow and are accompanied by color photographs of brilliant finished models. The book is aimed at intermediate folders, but the origami basics included at the start of the book make it accessible to beginners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65cbd71a50474d3910bac2bbcaf3200c8f0a272d","amp;dn":"Ornamental+Origami%3A+Exploring+3D+Geometric+Designs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65cbd71a50474d3910bac2bbcaf3200c8f0a272d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,203,215,26,80,71,77,57,16,186,194,187,202,243,32,12,143,10,39,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
