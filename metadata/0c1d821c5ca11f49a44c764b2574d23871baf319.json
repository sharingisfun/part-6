He was a central figure in the golden age of Cuban music, led two famous big bands, and was one of the &quot;house&quot; arrangers for the Tropicana .\n\nThe best big band that you might have heard in Havana in the years preceding and, briefly, following the Revolution, was arguably Bebo's. In Havana he was the king of the Tropicana and of the recording studio. He was one of the inventors of the mambo. And, though there are many contenders, one of the best Cuban orchestrators ever. \n\nThe quality - both the playing and the recording - of this album is astounding.\nThe orchestra is in top form and so is the maestro. This is an integral part of the mother lode of the Cuban big-band sound. There's plenty of drive and percussion in the cha chas and mambos to move the dustiest of shoes and hips. \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stately, graceful music, orchestral, with beautiful arrangements and perfect playing.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n&quot;The songs are consistently compelling, and aimed squarely at the dancefloor....The arrangements are bright and vibrant, with the orchestra playfully tossing melodic phrases back and forth...&quot;\n\n\nBebo Valdes and his Orchestra\n\nCuban Dance Party   1959\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n \n\nTracklist: \n\n1 Babalu \t\n2 Cha Cha No.1 \t\n3 El Cumbanchero \t\n4 Habana \t\n5 A Quien EngaÃƒÂ±es \t\n6 Ita Morreal \t\n7 El Manisero \t\n8 Feria De Los Siglos \t\n9 Aquellos Ojos Verdes \t\n10 Sacuma \t\n11 Tu Sabes Bien Que Te Quiero \nBonus Tracks Featuting Los Cordobeses: \t\n12 Besame Mucho \t\n13 Los Tintosos \t\n14 Poinciana \t\n15 El Bodeguero \t\n\n\n\nThis issue of &quot;Cuban Dance Party&quot; includes four bonus tracks featuring Los Cordobeses.\n\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c1d821c5ca11f49a44c764b2574d23871baf319","amp;dn":"Bebo+Valdes+-+Cuban+Dance+Party+1959+-+320Kbps+%23+DrBn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c1d821c5ca11f49a44c764b2574d23871baf319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,29,130,28,92,161,31,73,164,76,118,75,37,116,210,56,113,186,243,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
