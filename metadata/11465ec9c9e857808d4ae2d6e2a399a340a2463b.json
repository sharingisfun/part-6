Not at all. &quot;Desperate Journey&quot; is an exciting fast paced film about American and British soldiers inside Nazi Germany after their bombing plane crashes.\n\nThere is plenty of excitement as they try to evade their captors, the head being a very German-like Raymond Massey in another of his stellar performances. Alan Hale and Sig Ruman, the latter in one scene, bring comic relief.\n\nOf course, there is the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© speech of Nancy Coleman, a German helping the allies, who stays despite the fact that the Nazis know her whereabouts. Her speech about patriotism is familiar but keenly on target.\n\nWe have exciting chase scenes, and wonderful sabotage by our heroes inflicted upon Massey and his group of vultures.\n\nA wonderful war-time journey that should be viewed by all. \n\n\n\nDirector:\nRaoul Walsh\n\nCast:\nErrol Flynn ...
