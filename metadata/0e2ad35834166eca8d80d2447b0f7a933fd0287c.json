School Bus Driver\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Songs From a Ghost TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a short, sweet, 34 minute bluegrass ride that kind of sounds like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“O Brother Where Art ThouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ soundtrack if the artists werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying to make music that sounded like it was written in 1939. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nary an electric guitar to be found, the singer sounds like he was ripped straight out of sweet home Ala-bam, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more banjos going around then you would see at a family reunion for the backwoods sister-rammers in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deliverance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Only one track Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OutskirtsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ threatens to enter hippie wank territory, the remainder is comprised of songs that make you feel like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re walking around the sets for Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Kill a MockingbirdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It has that downhome southern comfort feel, and is perhaps most astutely represented by breezy jams like the sincere Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whiskey,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the nostalgic Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Way Street.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The majority of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Songs From a Ghost TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ holds up well, but its greatest redeemable factor is the presence of Ã¢â‚¬Å“At Your Window,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is arguably one of the top 10 bluegrass songs ever written.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2ad35834166eca8d80d2447b0f7a933fd0287c","amp;dn":"Trampled+By+Turtles+-+Songs+From+A+Ghost+Town+%5B2004%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e2ad35834166eca8d80d2447b0f7a933fd0287c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,42,211,88,52,22,110,202,141,128,210,68,123,15,122,147,63,208,40,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
