Led by guitarist/vocalist Deryck Whibley, who looked like a mash-up of the Prodigy's Keith Flint and cartoon land's Calvin, the band also included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys' goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own blink-182), Island put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates got the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles &quot;In Too Deep&quot; and &quot;Fat Lip&quot; became staples of both modern rock radio and Total Request Live. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tmp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Still Waiting\n02.The Hell Song\n03.Fat Lip\n04.We're All To Blame\n05.Walking Disaster\n06.In Too Deep\n07.Pieces\n08.Underclass Hero\n09.Motivation\n10.Makes No Difference (Alternate Version)\n11.With Me\n12.Handle This\n13.Over My Head (Better Off Dead)\n14.Pain For Pleasure\n15.The Hell Song (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                    ***Enjoy!***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3ab50a233f66c127be3e9bd971f97350742590","amp;dn":"Sum+41+-+14+Solid+Gold+Hits+%282009%29+mp3+%40+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3ab50a233f66c127be3e9bd971f97350742590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,58,181,10,35,63,102,193,39,190,62,155,217,113,249,115,80,116,37,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
