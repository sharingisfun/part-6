The main character Martin Odum (Sean Bean) is an undercover agent working for the FBI's Deep Cover Operations (DCO) division. He can alter himself and his personality into a different person for each job as needed - a fake identity or &quot;legend&quot;. Martin has a gift for deep cover, so much so that he often has a difficult time establishing where his &quot;legend&quot; ends and his real life begins. When a stranger plants seeds of doubt that Martin Odum himself is a &quot;legend&quot;, he questions who he really is. His partner is Crystal McGuire (Ali Larter), a fellow operative and she has a history with Martin. The series was developed by Howard Gordon, Jeffrey Nachmanoff and Mark Bomback. The first season consists of ten episodes.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0284b269b6d479ec0c1b8b3f55428cb8449fa711","amp;dn":"Legends.2014.S01E09.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0284b269b6d479ec0c1b8b3f55428cb8449fa711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,132,178,105,182,212,121,236,12,27,139,63,85,66,140,184,68,159,167,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
