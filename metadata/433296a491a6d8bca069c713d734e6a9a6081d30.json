The versatility of Warren Ellis' violin playing is what drives Horse Stories, but although the violin is the focal point, Mick Turner's guitar and Jim White's drumming are vital elements in making Dirty Three's sound so compelling. The tracks here are widely varied, from slow, languid pieces like &quot;1000 Miles&quot; and &quot;At the Bar&quot; and wild dances like &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;I Remember a Time When Once You Used to Love Me&quot; to stunningly beautiful tracks like the aptly titled &quot;Hope.&quot; It is fitting that Horse Stories helped Dirty Three reach a wider audience than they had with their earlier efforts, as it was an album that saw them reach new heights in creativity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433296a491a6d8bca069c713d734e6a9a6081d30","amp;dn":"Dirty+Three+-+Horse+Stories+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433296a491a6d8bca069c713d734e6a9a6081d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,50,150,164,145,166,216,188,160,105,199,19,215,52,230,169,166,8,29,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
