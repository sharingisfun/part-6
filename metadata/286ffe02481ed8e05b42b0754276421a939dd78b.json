Albion III Iceni is a cricket bat, a mace, a large trunk of blunt tree to bludgeon to death any track or cue it comes near.\n\nIceni is an investigation into low end, thundering enormity, horrifying rasp and obliterating distortion.\n\nFeaturing over 300 sickeningly fat, grimy, epic and mangled LOOPS by some exciting emerging UK-based producer/ programmer/ composers including The Flight (Lana Del Ray, Rufus Wainwright, Skye, Jess Mills, Bjork), Stanley Gabriel (Kate Bush, Ladyhawke, Little Boots) and Christian Henson (Programmer on Spy Game, Narnia, Composer of Severance, Black Death, Devil's Double).\n\nThe largest and lowest sets of drums available for use in London, including rare British marching toms. Played by the leader and members of the Olympic opening ceremony's drum corps.\n\nStephenson's set of SYNTH BASSES, pads and sequences generated from and in addition to.... wait for itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..\n\nTHE LARGEST, ASSEMBLED WORLD-CLASS, LOW-END ORCHESTRA FOR A COMMERCIAL SAMPLE PROJECT TO-DATE.\n\nTHE ENGLISH SESSION ORCHESTRA JUST GOT VERY VERY FAT AND VERY VERY FRIGHTENING:\n\nWinds: 2 contra bassoons, 2 contrabass clarinets, heckelphone, 2 bassoons, 2 bass clarinets, 1 bass saxophone\n\nBrass: 2 tubas, 2 cimbassi, 2 contra bass bones, 3 bass bones\n\nStrings: 0,0,0,24,8 YesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.. that's no violins, no violas, but 24 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCelli, and 8 Basses. Recorded both tutti and in two Ã¢â‚¬ËœCelli sections with the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCelli split into two on either side of the room with the Basses in the middle. It simply has to be heard to be believed.\n\nOur most expensive commercial venture to-date was recorded to tape via the rarest set of valve and ribbon mics in the hall at Air Lyndhurst, one of the greatest recording studios in the world (Batman Returns, Gladiator, Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter, Hunger Games).\n\nThe orchestral tool-set is primitively simple and effective; longs, legatos, shorts, with some of the most mind boggling FX in the brass and woods. They're designed for anyone to use regardless of their experience or understanding of orchestral disciplines and is scaleable on a variety of systems. This is a must-have library whether you're writing trailers, computer games, TV or film drama or need the new tool for the next generation of Dubstep, Breakbeat, Crunk or Grime.\n\nLaunching before Christmas, this is the train-set you always hoped Santa would bring you, but be warned, this library will make you feel dirty when you use it, you'll need a Silkwood style scrub-down after use and your subwoofer is just about to get the hiding of its life.\n\nABOUT THIS REDUX VERSION:\n\nEXTRA CONTENT:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Freshly mixed Albion Orchestra Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hyped EnsemblesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Iceni is remarkably tight and agile considering the numbers of players.
