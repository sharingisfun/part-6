One of Latin America's most esteemed authors, Rulfo's reputation rests on two slim books, the novel Pedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo (1955), and El Llano en llamas (1953), a collection of short stories. Fifteen of these seventeen short stories have been translated into English and published as The Burning Plain and Other Stories. This collection, includes his admired tale &quot;Ã‚Â¡Diles que no me maten!&quot; (&quot;Tell Them Not to Kill Me!&quot;).\n\n\n* Pedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo -- ePUB\n\nPedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo is a short novel written by Juan Rulfo about a man named Juan Preciado who travels to his recently deceased mother's hometown, Comala, to find his father, only to come across a literal ghost town-populated, that is, by spectral figures. Initially, the novel met with cool critical reception and sold only two thousand copies during the first four years; later, however, the book became highly acclaimed. PÃƒÂ¡ramo was a key influence of Latin American writers such as Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez. Pedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo has been translated into more than 30 different languages and the English version has sold more than a million copies in the United States.\n\nGabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez has said that he felt blocked as a novelist after writing his first four books and that it was only his life-changing discovery of Pedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo in 1961 that opened his way to the composition of his masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude. Moreover, Marquez claimed that he &quot;could recite the whole book, forwards and backwards.&quot; Jorge Luis Borges considered Pedro PÃƒÂ¡ramo to be one of the greatest texts written in any language.\n\n\n\nRead the following article, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_P%C3%A1ramo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_P%C3%A1ramo&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rulfo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rulfo&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2008/03/the_perfect_novel_youve_never_heard_of.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2008/03/the_perfect_novel_youve_never_heard_of.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45896f908558eb980054b10d4ff740d30bb0a662","amp;dn":"Juan+Rulfo+-+Pedro+P%26aacute%3Bramo+%28Mexican+Novel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45896f908558eb980054b10d4ff740d30bb0a662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,137,111,144,133,88,235,152,0,84,177,13,79,247,64,211,11,176,166,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
