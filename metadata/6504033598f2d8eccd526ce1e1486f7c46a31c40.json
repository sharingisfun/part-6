She is a light lyric soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves.\n\nTurunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fÃƒÂ¼r Musik Karlsruhe. She is well known as a professional classical lied singer but best known as the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, &quot;operatic&quot; lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed &quot;opera metal&quot;, inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on October 21, 2005 for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called HenkÃƒÂ¤ys ikuisuudesta. In 2007, Turunen released My Winter Storm, an album featuring various styles, including alternative rock and symphonic metal and started the Storm World Tour. Turunen released her third album, What Lies Beneath, in 2010. She also can be heard on the latest Scorpions record. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the Graspop Metal Meeting and the Wacken Open Air, before starting the What Lies Beneath World Tour, which lasted until April 8, 2012. Tarja's first live DVD Act I was filmed during this tour on March 30 and March 31, 2012 in Rosario, Argentina. Act I was released on August 24, 2012. On the 6th of May it was announced that the 4th album (released 28 August 2013) would be named Colours in the Dark. Tarja started the Colours in the Dark World Tour on October 17, 2013 to promote her new album. On 20 February it was revealed on the blog that a new version of the album called Left in the Dark would be released later this year and will feature different versions of the songs on the original Colours in the Dark. Tarja's second live DVD was filmed during the events of Beauty and the Beat featuring a big orchestra, choir, Mike Terrana and Tarja herself and will be released on May 30.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Life and career\n        1.1 1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995: Early life\n        1.2 1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2005: With Nightwish\n        1.3 2005: Breakup\n        1.4 2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent: Independent career\n    2 Singing style\n        2.1 Development\n        2.2 Register\n    3 Reception\n    4 Personal life\n    5 Discography\n        5.1 Solo career\n        5.2 Side projects\n        5.3 With Nightwish\n    6 Notes\n    7 References\n    8 External links\n\nLife and career\n1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995: Early life\n\nTarja Turunen was born in the small village of Puhos, near Kitee, Finland. She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Marjatta Turunen worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song &quot;Enkeli taivaan&quot; (the Finnish version of &quot;From Heaven Above to Earth I Come&quot;) in the Kitee church hall at age three. She joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.\n\nAt comprehensive school, Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, &quot;Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.&quot; Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, &quot;If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times&quot;. At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including soul music by Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Later she listened to songs from the classical crossover singer Sarah Brightman, especially the song &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and decided to focus on that genre of music. At eighteen, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy.\n1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2005: With Nightwish\nFive band members taking their bows at the end of a performance\nTurunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in JÃƒÂ¤msÃƒÂ¤, Finland, on June 25, 2005\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with &quot;more bombastic, dramatic&quot; songs in September 1997. Holopainen used this material to convince the Finnish label Spinefarm Records to publish the band's debut album, Angels Fall First. The success of the first album came as a surprise to the label. As the album hit the top 40 of the Finnish charts, Nightwish started their tour The First Tour of the Angels. That same year, Turunen performed at the Savonlinna Opera Festival for the first time, singing songs from Wagner and Verdi.\nFour band members perform before a live audience\nTurunen with Nightwish in Kitee, Finland, on May 22, 2004\n\nDue to her commitment to the band, Turunen was not able to concentrate sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted. In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, Oceanborn. This album lacked the earlier elements of folk and ambient music, and instead focused on fast, melodic keyboard and guitar lines and Turunen's dramatic voice. In addition to the Oceanborn Europe Tour (1999), Turunen sang solo in Waltari's rock-themed ballet Evankeliumi (also known as Evangelicum) in several sold-out performances at the Finnish National Opera. In 2000 and 2001, Nightwish recorded Wishmaster and Over the Hills and Far Away and toured Europe and South America (the Wishmaster World Tour). During the Wishmaster World Tour, Turunen met Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli whom she married in 2003.\n\nTurunen enrolled in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule fÃƒÂ¼r Musik Karlsruhe to gain a professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto VÃƒÂ¡zquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.\n\nIn 2002, Turunen toured South America, performing in the classical Lied concert Noche Escandinava (Scandinavian Night) to sold-out houses. Following this and an exhausting world tour in support of Century Child (the World Tour of the Century), Nightwish took a hiatus and Turunen returned to Karlsruhe to finish her studies. After the hiatus Nightwish recorded the album Once; it was released on May 10, 2004.[24] The album has sold platinum in Finland and Germany and was the best selling album in all of Europe in July 2004. The band performed in the supporting Once Upon a Tour throughout 2004 and 2005.\n\nFor Christmas 2004, Turunen released her first solo single, titled &quot;Yhden enkelin unelma&quot; (One Angel's Dream), which sold gold in her native country of Finland. At Christmas 2005 it made a reentry at position one in the Finnish Charts. In spring 2005 she prepared the duet &quot;Leaving You for Me&quot;, a collaboration with Martin Kesici, accompanied by a video. And theres is more but Google her for it get music here....\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6504033598f2d8eccd526ce1e1486f7c46a31c40","amp;dn":"Tarja+-+Colours+In+The+Dark++MP3++320k++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6504033598f2d8eccd526ce1e1486f7c46a31c40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,4,3,53,152,242,216,236,205,82,108,225,225,72,111,124,70,163,28,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
