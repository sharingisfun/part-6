Sonny falls asleep while his Mom reads him a bedtime story and wakes up in 'Balloon Land', a magical world filed with giant balloon people and animals. It is largely comprised of amateur footage of a Thanksgiving parade in Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nRiffTrax released their riff in November 2014.  Mike Nelson has called this his favorite movie in his entire career of riffing bad movies. This sentiment has been shared by both Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. \r\n\r\nIt was voted the Riff of the Year in the RiffWiki.net 2014 Year in Review feature.\r\n\r\nFun In Balloonland throws a whole casserole of crazy at the screen: kindergartners in gold lamÃ© diapers, giant Indian stereotypes, a maniac of a parade host, blow fish who halfheartedly tell jokes, a lengthy guessing game, The Farmer In The Dell, two headed cats, and something called The Marrying Turkey. Then Santa shows up. Trust us, it will all make sense when you sit down and watch it.*\r\n\r\n*100% untrue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee859258020deab2a5175143195c21f53102dcb","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Fun+in+Balloonland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee859258020deab2a5175143195c21f53102dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,232,89,37,128,32,222,171,42,81,117,20,49,149,194,31,83,16,45,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
