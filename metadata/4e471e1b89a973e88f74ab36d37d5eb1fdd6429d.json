A voice that has a raw sensualtiy, both delicate and forceful. The cons? The album has MirwaisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature electronica stamp all over it and leans in to the best of MadonnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dance inducing anthems. Which, of course, is hardly surprising. However, any calls for lack of orginality should be damned as this album is a voice ahead of its time, a real coup for the artists.\n\n\n\nMore info of Y.A.S:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e471e1b89a973e88f74ab36d37d5eb1fdd6429d","amp;dn":"Mirwais+presents+Y.A.S.+-+Arabology+-+2009+-+Wiktorpl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e471e1b89a973e88f74ab36d37d5eb1fdd6429d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,71,30,27,137,169,115,232,143,116,171,54,211,125,94,177,253,214,66,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
