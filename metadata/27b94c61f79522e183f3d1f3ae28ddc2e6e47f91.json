With step-by-step instructions and 250 photos and illustrations, the book guides readers through projects that can increase the convenience, beauty, and value of a home. \nBoth seasoned remodelers and inspired novices learn how to revamp a wall or find a new solution for a simple window treatment, how to decorate a lamp or skirt an ottoman, or even double storage space with clever wall-mounted racks. Here are clear, concise plans for everything from bordered draperies and piped Roman shades to stenciled floor cloths and glazed walls to refurbished bar stools and crackle-finished sideboards. With both substantial projects like slipcovered headboards, and super-easy accents such as ribbon-trimmed lampshades, 52 Weekend Decorating Projects shows readers how to transform every room in the home without a decorator and on a budget.\n\n==================\n\nSimply Elegant Flowers\n\nMichael George, Bob Shuman\nISBN: 1558708065  \n2008 \nEPUB \n208 pages \n17.5 MB\n\nNew York's premier fashion industry florist, Michael George is known for his signature graphic, modern arrangements that are as popular in Manhattan hotels and storefronts as they are on the pages of Vogue and on the set of Good Morning America.
