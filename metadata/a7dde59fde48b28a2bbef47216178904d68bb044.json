She shows how to reframe what she calls Riskophobia, turn off the fear voices, and circumvent ancient defense systems.\n\nReaders can then create an Escalating Risk Hierarchy by &quot;chunking down&quot; their vision into small, actionable steps, ordered from least to most anxiety inducing. By combining stress-busting relaxation techniques with small action steps, the readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ odds for realizing their vision greatly increase in this Relax, Risk, Repeat cycle. Gill also shows readers how to &quot;Avoid Limiters &amp; Embrace Liberators,&quot; keeping naysayers at bay while seeking influential supporters who can help free their creativity and productivity. Capitalizing on her business background, coaching expertise, and a personal history of risk-taking and resilience, Gill makes complex concepts relevant and accessible through immediately applicable tools, exercises, self-tests, and questionnaires that challenge readers to change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7dde59fde48b28a2bbef47216178904d68bb044","amp;dn":"You+Unstuck%3A+Mastering+the+New+Rules+of+Risk-taking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7dde59fde48b28a2bbef47216178904d68bb044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,221,229,159,222,72,178,138,43,190,244,114,22,23,137,4,214,139,176,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
