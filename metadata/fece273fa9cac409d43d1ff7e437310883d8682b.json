Free to try for 40 days ($29 for single license), WinRAR is a top dog in the compression category.\n\nWinRARÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interface is about as simple as it gets. Start creating (or add to) an archive by dragging and dropping your files into the interface or by browsing through the Folder Tree side panel (when enabled). From there, the most common functions are laid out in the form of colorful, mostly intuitive icons along the top, which can all be customized by downloading themes from the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Web site. You can Add files to, Extract, Test, Delete, or even Repair archives right from the main interface. Drop-down menus house the programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more advanced features, including self-extracting archives, archive locking, benchmarking, and autodeletion of temp files.\n\n\nPlease SEEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fece273fa9cac409d43d1ff7e437310883d8682b","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.20+beta+3+with+key+%5BAlbUploads001%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fece273fa9cac409d43d1ff7e437310883d8682b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,206,39,63,169,202,196,9,212,61,31,247,228,55,49,8,131,216,104,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
