They are shooting the last scene where the ghost appears crawling out of a dark hallway, but Gade collapses and is taken to the hospital by Aey in which the doctor tells him she has died.

Gade suddenly appears much to their shock afterwards, though she tells them that she secretly left the hospital and the doctor who tells Aey is merely the twin of the real doctor. As they wave for a car to take them to the hospital, a car which is driven by a sleepy woman crashes them off.\n\n\n\nFile Format..........: AVI\nCodec.................: XVID\nBit Rate...............: 2018 KBPS\nResolution............: 720x394\nFrame rate...........: 25.000 fps\nCodec.................: MP3\nBitrate.................:48.0 KHZ, 320 KBPS\nsource....................:Hey1911\nSubs:English Hardsubs\n\n\nScreen: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/125b0c62cf0ecce4e2bb865a6a5267069da7ed45.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/125b0c62cf0ecce4e2bb865a6a5267069da7ed45.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:327c246ac44e780224daf3003ae29d69d34539f7","amp;dn":"4bia+aka+Phobia+Duology-EngHsubs-zombiRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"327c246ac44e780224daf3003ae29d69d34539f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,124,36,106,196,78,120,2,36,218,243,0,58,226,157,105,211,69,57,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
