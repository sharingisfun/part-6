I actually found the illustrations to be more effective than the written version (which I read 3 years ago).[cut]\nAfter finishing the book I decided to quit. I've been smoke-free for three weeks! I'm also proud to say that I can go to parties, drink, and have no urge whatsoever to smoke. The book has a great way of showing the reader a different perspective of smoking in general.............\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b20a375539552cc4214b26fd3a6918f1fa9079","amp;dn":"The+Illustrated+Easyway+to+Stop+Smoking%3A+A+Smoker%5C%27s+Guide+to+Ju","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b20a375539552cc4214b26fd3a6918f1fa9079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,178,10,55,85,57,85,44,196,33,75,38,253,58,105,24,241,250,144,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
