Furthermore the load of the seeders will be better used and I hope that the average speed of the whole series will increase.\n\nBig thanks to kef71 for the original upload!\n\nNote: I created the checksums *after* the download because unfortunately there were no checksums in the original torrents.\n\nPlease note that disc 6 of season 1 is a bonus disc with episodes of TOS. You can leave it, if you aren't interested in it. Season 1 of Voyager had less episodes than the others, but was sold for the same price. For compensation, Paramount decided to add some TOS episodes.\n\nSorry, I forgot to include the MDS files from the original torrents. Since I don't plan to burn them on DVD, they are useless for me. I advise against burning them on DVD since storing the ISOs on HDD is safer, cheaper and takes less space than 48 DVDs. But if you still want to burn them, here are the files (both archives contain the same files):  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stashbox.org/676367/Voyager_mds.tar.bz2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stashbox.org/676367/Voyager_mds.tar.bz2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stashbox.org/676371/Voyager_mds.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stashbox.org/676371/Voyager_mds.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI recommend to enable DHT and encryption in your torrent client.\nPlease help me seeding and don't &quot;snatch &amp; leave&quot;. Please seed at least for a few days.\n\nBTW: I plan to create similar torrents (untouched PAL DVD ISOs) of Enterprise and TOS as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c0ebdf1669bdde88bdfb67619aa1186a87fffd","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+Voyager","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c0ebdf1669bdde88bdfb67619aa1186a87fffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,192,235,223,22,105,189,222,136,189,251,103,97,154,161,24,106,135,255,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
