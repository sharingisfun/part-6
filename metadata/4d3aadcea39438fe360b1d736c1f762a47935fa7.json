They are well-known as one of the earliest ska-core bands, a genre that fuses elements of hardcore with ska punk. The band consisted of frontman Jesse Michaels (vocals), Tim Armstrong (credited as &quot;Lint&quot;) (vocals/guitar), Matt Freeman (credited as Matt McCall) (bass/backing vocals), and Dave Mello (Drums/backing vocals). The band's name, previously abandoned by another Gilman group, Isocracy, was derived from the Operation Ivy series of nuclear tests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3aadcea39438fe360b1d736c1f762a47935fa7","amp;dn":"Operation+IVY+-+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3aadcea39438fe360b1d736c1f762a47935fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,58,173,206,163,148,56,254,54,11,29,115,108,31,118,42,71,147,95,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
