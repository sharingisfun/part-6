He has produced hard-boiled detective stories, taut suspense thrillers, literature, and erotica, and has succeeded in all these genres because he knows how to grab a reader with an opening line, and how to tighten that grip until the final sentence. In Writing the Novel: From Plot to Print, Block offers neither tricks nor formulas, but straight-forward advice based on the experience that comes with producing more than one hundred books. He explains how to refine an idea, how to study oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chosen genre, and how to use the novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expansive form to find oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particular voice. And he tells it all in the easy, immediate style that has made his own work so successful. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Lawrence Block, including rare photos and never-before-seen documents from his personal collection, and a new afterword written by the author.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4608ab46a97660bf4dbeaadb0269ae0116022d9","amp;dn":"Writing+the+Novel+-+Lawrence+Block","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4608ab46a97660bf4dbeaadb0269ae0116022d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,96,138,180,106,151,102,11,244,219,234,173,176,38,154,224,17,96,34,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
