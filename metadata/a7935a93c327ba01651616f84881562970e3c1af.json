When Plant recommended his friend John Bonham as the drummer, one of the most successful bands in rock history was born as Led Zeppelin. But the group that started with such force also ended in flames after 12 years, as Bonham's death from alcohol poisoning in 1980 split the band after nine albums. The remaining members went their separate ways, but Bonham's death hit Plant particularly hard. Starting his solo career in 1982 with his Zeppelin-like Pictures at Eleven album, Plant would use a slew of great drummers over the next few years, including Phil Collins, Cozy Powell, Barriemore Barlow, and Richie Hayward. Collins appeared on the 1983 follow-up, The Principle of Moments, and Plant achieved a lighter touch somewhere between Genesis and Zeppelin's quieter side with tracks like 'In the Mood' and 'Big Log.' But the singer would feed his Elvis Presley infatuation on 1984's The Honeydrippers, Vol. 1, teaming with Page and other guests on influential roots rock material.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Burning Down One Side\n02.Moonlight In Samosa\n03.Slow Dancer\n04.Like I've Never Been Gone\n05.Other Arms\n06.In The Mood\n07.Horizontal  Departure\n08.Big Blog\n09.Turnaround\n10.I Get A Thrill\n11.Sea Of Love\n12.I Got A Woman\n13.Young Boy Blues\n14.Rockin' At Midnight\n15.Pink And Black\n16.Little By Little\n17.Sixes And Sevens\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Heaven Knows\n02.Tall Cool One\n03.Ship Of Fools\n04.Hurting Kind (I've Got My Eyes On You)\n05.Liars Dance\n06.I Believe\n07.29 Psalms\n08.Calling To You\n09.Promised Land\n10.Colours Of A Shade\n11.Network News\n12.Memory Song (Hello Hello)\n13.If I Were A Carpenter\n14.Great Spirit\n15.The Greatest Gift\n16.Wonderful One\n\n\nDisc 3\n\n01.Another Tribe\n02.Funny In My Mind (I Believe I'm Fixin' To Die)\n03.Most High\n04.Shine It All Around\n05.Morning Dew\n06.Shining In The Light\n07.One More Cup Of Coffee\n08.Skip's Song\n09.Tin Pan Valley\n10.Upon A Golden Horse\n11.Song Of The Siren\n12.Dancing In Heaven\n13.Darkness, Darkness\n14.Hey Joe\n15.Dirt In A Hole\n16.Rich Woman\n17.Gone Gone Gone (Done Moved On)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7935a93c327ba01651616f84881562970e3c1af","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Greatest+Hits+3CD+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7935a93c327ba01651616f84881562970e3c1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,147,90,147,195,39,186,1,101,22,22,248,72,129,86,41,112,227,193,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
