Although Maynard James Keenan's plaintive vocals immediately conjure up thoughts of his other outfit, APC distinguishes ... Full Descriptionitself by furthering the melodic elements present on the group's first outing, MER DE NOMS. &quot;The Package&quot; starts things off slowly, with a foreboding guitar line and minimal drum cadence that gradually build into a full-blown Sabbath-like dirge. Carried along by the fluid bass playing of Jeordie White (formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson), &quot;The Noose&quot; gives a tip of the hat to the Cure's gloomiest work, while White and guitarist Billy Howerdel create an entrancingly chiming bass/guitar tapestry on &quot;Blue.&quot; \n\nThough many of the album's tracks surge with APC's powerful metal riffs, the folky &quot;A Stranger&quot; and the lush &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; both feature Keenan's voice supported by a gorgeous bed of strings and little else. A cycle that touches on themes of corruption, despair, and redemption, THIRTEENTH STEP is brought to a fitting conclusion by &quot;Gravity,&quot; a powerful song that captures both the dark and light aspects of this fascinating band. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893ae2d598fb2e2d021875485697f83de08f3517","amp;dn":"A+Perfect+Circle+-+Thirteenth+Step+%28EAC.FLAC%29+ResourceRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893ae2d598fb2e2d021875485697f83de08f3517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,58,226,213,152,251,46,45,2,24,117,72,86,151,248,61,224,143,53,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
