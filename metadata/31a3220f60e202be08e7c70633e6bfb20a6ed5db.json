All four members had wildly different personalities, as their notoriously intense live performances demonstrated. The group was a whirlwind of activity, as the wild Keith Moon fell over his drum kit and Pete Townshend leaped into the air with his guitar, spinning his right hand in exaggerated windmills. Vocalist Roger Daltrey strutted across the stage with a thuggish menace, as bassist John Entwistle stood silent, functioning as the eye of the hurricane. These divergent personalities frequently clashed, but these frictions also resulted in a decade's worth of remarkable music -- it took some five years to find their audience, but at the tail end of the 1960s they suddenly achieved a level of popularity rivaling the Rolling Stones, both as a live act and in album sales. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal International Japan\nCatalog:\t\tUICY-90824/5\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA &amp; 99.94% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.I Can't Explain\n02.Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n03.My Generation\n04.The Kids Are Alright\n05.A Legal Matter\n06.Substitute\n07.I'm A Boy\n08.Boris The Spider\n09.Happy Jack\n10.Pictures Of Lily\n11.I Can See For Miles\n12.Call Me Lightning\n13.Magic Bus\n14.Pinball Wizard\n15.I'm Free\n16.See Me, Feel Me\n17.The Seeker\n18.Summertime Blues (Live)\n19.My Wife\n20.Baba O'Riley\n21.Bargain\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Behind Blue Eyes\n02.Won't Get Fooled Again\n03.Let's See Action\n04.Pure And Easy\n05.Join Together\n06.Long Live Rock\n07.The Real Me\n08.5:15\n09.Love Reign O'er Me\n10.Squeeze Box\n11.Who Are You\n12.Sister Disco\n13.You Better You Bet\n14.Don't Let Go The Coat\n15.Another Tricky Day\n16.Eminence Front\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n                                            \n                                \n                                ****Thanks!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a3220f60e202be08e7c70633e6bfb20a6ed5db","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+TheUltimate+Collection+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a3220f60e202be08e7c70633e6bfb20a6ed5db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,163,34,15,96,226,2,190,8,231,199,6,51,230,191,178,10,110,213,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
