The six volume set of Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering illustrates how this field has been the key to enabling technology responsible for the phenomenal growth of wireless communications. This set also examines how RF and microwave engineering continues to have great influence as the technology behind such important applications as radar, remote sensing, remote control, sensors, navigation, surveillance, electronic warfare, radiometers, plasma research, and imaging.\n\nPrize or Award\n\n    * AAP Awards for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing, 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 5832 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-Interscience; 1 edition (March 14, 2005)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0471270539\n# ISBN-13: 978-0471270539","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6212e37e616aaad6fa5bbf1ec26c21d09dcaaa2","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+RF+and+Microwave+Engineering+%2C+%286Vols%29%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6212e37e616aaad6fa5bbf1ec26c21d09dcaaa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,33,46,55,230,22,170,173,111,165,187,241,236,38,194,29,9,220,170,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
