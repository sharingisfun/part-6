Beyond that, the exercises explore the fundamental importance of communicating ideas through metaphor. Specific exercises increase a writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to convey ideas that matter by using language that lingers and perhaps even takes up residence in the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Moving from balances to series, from cumulatives to suspensions, and working with increasingly sophisticated forms of metaphor, the course challenges writers to stretch their stylistic repertoire, to expand their view of sentences, and to see the world as they have not seen it before. If you hope to increase the gracefulness, the artfulness and the power of your prose, or want your students to do likewise, this course is for you. If you believe that sentences carefully wrought can touch a readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart and lift a readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit, then Mary Nilsen had you in mind when she wrote this book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dr. Nancy Jones (from the back cover). \n\nWords that Sing can be used as a text for semester-long writing classes or for shorter, intensive workshops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7f138584f8db5472953f18299c3677d21111f8","amp;dn":"Words+That+Sing%2C+Composing+Lyrical+Prose+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7f138584f8db5472953f18299c3677d21111f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,127,19,133,132,248,219,84,114,149,63,24,41,156,54,119,210,17,17,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
