One such artist was Jim Croce, a songwriter with a knack for both upbeat, catchy singles and empathetic, melancholy ballads. Though Croce only recorded a few studio albums before an untimely plane crash, he continues to be remembered posthumously. Croce appealed to fans as a common man, and it was not a gimmick -- he was a father and husband who went through a series of blue-collar jobs. And whether he used dry wit, gentle emotions, or sorrow, Croce sang with a rare form of honesty and power. Few artists have ever been able to pull off such down-to-earth storytelling as convincingly as he was.\n\n\nJames Croce was born in Philadelphia, PA, on January 10, 1943. Raised on ragtime and country, Croce played the accordion as a child and would eventually teach himself the guitar. It wasn't until his freshman year of college that he began to take music seriously, forming several bands over the next few years. After graduation, he continued to play various gigs at local bars and parties, working as both a teacher and construction worker to support himself and his wife, Ingrid. In 1969, the Croces and an old friend from college, Tommy West, moved to New York and record an album. When the Jim and Ingrid record failed to sell, they moved to a farm in Lyndell, PA, where Jim juggled several jobs, including singing for radio commercials. Eventually he was noticed and signed by the ABC/Dunhill label and released his second album, You Don't Mess Around with Jim, in 1972. The record spawned three hits: &quot;You Don't Mess Around With Jim,&quot; &quot;Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels),&quot; and &quot;Time in a Bottle.&quot; The latter would become Croce's breakthrough hit, shooting all the way to number one on the Billboard charts. Croce quickly followed with Life and Times in early 1973 and gained his first number one hit with &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tSanctuary Records\nCat.#\t\t\tSMETD117\t\t\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.87% CDDA &amp; 99.93% CDDA &amp; 99.81% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.You Don't Mess Around With Jim\n02.Tomorrow's Gonna Be A Brighter Day\n03.New York's Not My Home\n04.Hard Time Losin' Man\n05.Photographs And Memories\n06.Walkin' Back To Georgia\n07.Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)\n08.Time In A Bottle\n09.Rapid Roy (The Stock Car Boy)\n10.Box # 10\n11.A Long Time Ago\n12.Hey Tomorrow\n13.One Less Set Of Footsteps\n14.Roller Derby Queen\n15.Dreamin' Again\n16.Careful Man\n17.Alabama Rain\n18.A Good Time Man Like Me Ain't Got No Business (Singin' The Blues)\n19.Next Time, This Time\n20.Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\n21.These Dreams\n22.Speedball Tucker\n23.It Doesn't Have To Be That Way\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.I Got A Name\n02.Lover's Cross\n03.Five Short Minutes\n04.Age\n05.Workin' At The Car Wash Blues\n06.I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song\n07.Salon And Saloon\n08.Thursday\n09.Top Hat Bar And Grill\n10.Recently\n11.The Hard Way Every Time\n12.Circle Of Style\n13.Carnival Of Pride\n14.Wear Out The Turnpike\n15.Can't Wait\n16.(The) Migrant Worker\n17.Railroad Song\n18.(And) I Remember Her\n19.More Than Tomorrow\n20.Cotton Mouth River\n21.Child Of Midnight\n22.The Way We Used To Be\n23.Maybe Tomorrow\n24.Stone Walls\n25.Country Girl\n26.Which Way Are You Goin'\n27.Mississippi Lady\n28.Chain Gang Medley: (Chain Gang/He Will Break Your Heart (AKA He Don't Love You)\n29.Ol' Man River\n\n\nDisc 3\n\n01.Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)\n02.Roller Derby Queen (Dialogue)\n03.Roller Derby Queen\n04.Next Time, This Time\n05.Trucker (Dialogue)\n06.Speedball Tucker\n07.New York's Not My Home\n08.Hard Time Losin' Man\n09.Ball Of Kerrymuir (Dialogue)\n10.Ball Of Kerrymuir\n11.You Don't Mess Around With Jim\n12.It Doesn't Have To Be That Way\n13.Careful Man (Dialogue)\n14.Careful Man\n15.Shopping For Clothes\n16.These Dreams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b674076607618b865709ad8a918c28a5143dc204","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+-+Anthology+3CD+Boxset++%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b674076607618b865709ad8a918c28a5143dc204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,116,7,102,7,97,139,134,87,9,173,138,145,140,40,165,20,61,194,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
