That gave birth to The Sicilian Defence, a not-so-subtly titled kiss-off album designed to fulfill contractual obligations and subsequently shelved when the two parties came to terms.\nThe Sicilian Defence was created by Parsons and Woolfson over a three-day session at FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bear Studios and delivered to Arista Records in March 1981 amid tense contract negotiations between the Project and Clive DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Arista label. The title derived from the name of a series of opening chess moves, which was apt considering the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nReportedly a dissonant, atonal collection that was far-removed from what Davis expected of the band, The Sicilian Defence was shelved.  The Project remained on Arista through 1987Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Gaudi, its final release.  (Parsons and Woolfson resumed their collaboration on the 1990 album Freudiana, the studio cast recording of a Woolfson-composed rock opera.)  An edited  version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElsieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ThemeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from The Sicilan Defence was included as a bonus track on an expanded edition of the 1979 album Eve, but the full-length track and the album from which it was derived makes its first-ever appearance as part of Legacy RecordingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 11-CD box set The Alan Parsons Project: The Complete Albums Collection.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cadc8494a4393e75174dadd003ecabbc73ab8a3","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+-+The+Sicilian+Defence+%282014%29+MP3%40320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cadc8494a4393e75174dadd003ecabbc73ab8a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,173,200,73,74,67,147,231,81,116,218,221,0,62,202,187,199,58,184,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
