Andrew Harvey, the popular spiritual scholar and writer, has selected excerpts from ancient and contemporary sources, including extracts from the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and other classical Hindu texts; the words of such venerable spiritual teachers as Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi; and the devotional poetry of Mirabai, Ramprasad, and many others. The scope of this anthology makes it a marvelous introduction to Hindu mystical literature, while the power and beauty of the language will inspire those already familiar with the genre.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 192 pages\r\nPublisher: Shambhala; 1st edition (December 26, 2001)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1570624496\r\nISBN-13: 978-1570624490\r\n \nhttp://www.andrewharvey.net/shop/teachings-hindu-mystics/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43a1f5d6f7c55c58d19ee45155d5dfc78c4490df","amp;dn":"Teachings+of+the+Hindu+Mystics+Kindle+Edition+by+Andrew+Harvey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43a1f5d6f7c55c58d19ee45155d5dfc78c4490df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,161,245,214,247,197,92,88,209,158,228,81,85,213,223,199,140,68,144,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
