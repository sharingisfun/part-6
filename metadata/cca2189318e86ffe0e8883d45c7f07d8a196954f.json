Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey.[1]\n\nSpringsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born in the U.S.A. and Born to Run, showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million worldwide[2] and he has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award. He is widely regarded by many as one of the most influential songwriters of the 20th century, and in 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 23rd greatest artist of all time in its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. \n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings from Asbury Park, NJ 1973\n\n\nGreetings from Asbury Park, N.J. is the first studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1973. It only sold about 25,000 copies in the first year of its release, but had significant critical impact. It was ranked at #379 by Rolling Stone on its list of 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nSpringsteen and his first manager Mike Appel decided to record the album at the low-priced, out-of-the-way 914 Sound Studios to save as much as possible of the Columbia Records advance and cut the record in a single week. Richard Davis, upright bass player on &quot;The Angel&quot;, also played the bass on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks.\n\nBoth &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; were released as singles by Columbia, but neither made a dent in the US charts. Manfred Mann's Earth Band released a version of &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; on their album The Roaring Silence, which reached #1 on Billboard's Hot 100 on 19 February 1977 and #1 on the Canadian RPM chart the same day. This recording of &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; is Springsteen's only #1 single as a songwriter on the Hot 100.\n\nOn November 22, 2009, Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ was played in its entirety for the first time by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York, to celebrate the last show of the Working on a Dream tour.[2] This marked the E Street Band's first-ever performance of &quot;The Angel&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n2.\t&quot;Growin' Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n3.\t&quot;Mary Queen of Arkansas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n4.\t&quot;Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n5.\t&quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n6.\t&quot;The Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n7.\t&quot;For You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n8.\t&quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n9.\t&quot;It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle 1973\n\n\nThe Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle is the second album by Bruce Springsteen and the as-yet-unnamed E Street Band, and is described by Allmusic as &quot;one of the greatest albums in the history of rock &amp; roll.&quot;[1] It was released in 1973. The album includes the song &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),&quot; the band's most-used set-closing song for the first 10 years of its career.\n\nAs with Springsteen's first album, it was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. However, once Springsteen achieved popularity with Born to Run, several selections from this album became popular FM radio airplay and concert favorites.\n\nThe E Street Band is known to have taken its name from David Sancious' mother's home in Belmar, New Jersey. But based on first-hand recounts of Sancious, the 'shuffle' occurred when the band's rented truck broke down late one night after a gig in New York City. Snowing, but within walking distance of Sancious' mother's home, the band decided to walk the short distance. The back photo on the album has the six band members standing in a doorway. The picture was of an antique store on Sairs Ave in the west end section of Long Branch, New Jersey. The building was across the street from West End Elementary School, and for years was Tommy Reeds bicycle repair shop and penny candy store; it has since been demolished and its former location is occupied by a parking lot.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 132 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[6] On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time ever in a concert at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n2.\t&quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:36\n3.\t&quot;Kitty's Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:09\n4.\t&quot;Wild Billy's Circus Story&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n5.\t&quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:45\n6.\t&quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:04\n7.\t&quot;New York City Serenade&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn To Run 1975\n\n\nBorn to Run is the third album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. It was released on August 25, 1975 through Columbia Records. It captured the heaviness of Springsteen's earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences.\n\nBorn to Run was a critical and commercial success and became Springsteen's breakthrough album. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, eventually selling six million copies in the US by the year 2000. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;; the first helped Springsteen to reach mainstream popularity. The tracks &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and &quot;Jungleland&quot; became staples of album-oriented rock radio and Springsteen concert high points. The album has been placed on several &quot;best ever&quot; lists and is listed in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of historic recordings.\n\nOn November 14, 2005, a &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; remaster of the album was released as a box set including two DVDs: a production diary film and a concert movie. Having been ranked number 18 on Rolling Stone's &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;[1], it is widely considered his magnum opus.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Thunder Road&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n2.\t&quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n3.\t&quot;Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n4.\t&quot;Backstreets&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:30\n5.\t&quot;Born to Run&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n6.\t&quot;She's the One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n7.\t&quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n8.\t&quot;Jungleland&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkness on The Edge Of Town 1978\n\n\nDarkness on the Edge of Town is the fourth album by Bruce Springsteen, released in the late spring of 1978. The album marked the end of a three year period of forced hiatus from recording brought on by contractual obligations and legal battling with former manager Mike Appel.[1] Although the album did not produce high charting singles it nevertheless remained on the charts for 97 weeks.[1] In September 2010 a documentary film chronicling the making of Darkness was first shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. Quoting Springsteen as saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMore than rich, more than famous, more than happy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wanted to be greatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, reviewer Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger commented: &quot;For many fans, that long journey pulled onto the Turnpike here.&quot; \n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Badlands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n2.\t&quot;Adam Raised a Cain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n3.\t&quot;Something in the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n4.\t&quot;Candy's Room&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n5.\t&quot;Racing in the Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:53\n6.\t&quot;The Promised Land&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n7.\t&quot;Factory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n8.\t&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n9.\t&quot;Prove It All Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n\n\n\n\n\nThe River 1980\n\n\nThe River is the fifth studio album (a double album) by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1980. The sources of The River go back into earlier parts of Springsteen's recording career. &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, &quot;Ramrod&quot;, and &quot;Sherry Darling&quot; were leftovers from his previous album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, and had been featured on that 1978 tour, as had parts of &quot;Drive All Night&quot; as a long interpolation within &quot;Backstreets&quot;. &quot;The River&quot; had premiered at the September 1979 Musicians United for Safe Energy concerts, gaining a featured spot in the subsequent documentary No Nukes.\n\n\n&quot;[The River] was a record that was sort of the gateway to a lot of my future writing. It was a record we made after Darkness on the Edge of Town. It was a record made during a recession - hard times in the States. Its title song is a song I wrote for my brother-in-law and sister. My brother-in-law was in the construction industry, lost his job and had to struggle very hard back in the late 70s, like so many people are doing today. It was a record where I first started to tackle men and women and families and marriage. There were certain songs on it that lead to complete records later on: &quot;The River&quot; sorta went to the writing on Nebraska, &quot;Stolen Car&quot; went to the writing on Tunnel of Love. Originally it was a single record. I handed it in with just one record and I took it back because I didn't feel it was big enough. Wanted to capture the themes I had been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added music that made our live shows so much fun and joy for our audience. So, In the end, we're gonna take you down to The River tonight.&quot;\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n2.\t&quot;Sherry Darling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n3.\t&quot;Jackson Cage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n4.\t&quot;Two Hearts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n5.\t&quot;Independence Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50\n6.\t&quot;Hungry Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n7.\t&quot;Out in the Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n8.\t&quot;Crush on You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n9.\t&quot;You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n10.\t&quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n11.\t&quot;The River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Point Blank&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n2.\t&quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n3.\t&quot;I'm a Rocker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n4.\t&quot;Fade Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n5.\t&quot;Stolen Car&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n6.\t&quot;Ramrod&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n7.\t&quot;The Price You Pay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n8.\t&quot;Drive All Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:33\n9.\t&quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska 1982\n\n\nNebraska is the sixth studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1982 on Columbia Records. Sparsely-recorded on a cassette-tape Portastudio, the tracks on Nebraska were originally intended as demos of songs to be recorded with the E Street Band. However, Springsteen ultimately decided to release the demos themselves. Nebraska remains one of the most highly-regarded albums in his catalogue.[citation needed] The songs on Nebraska deal with ordinary, blue collar characters who face a challenge or a turning point in their lives. Unlike his previous albums, very little salvation and grace is present within the songs.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n&quot;Nebraska&quot; \n&quot;Atlantic City&quot; \n&quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; \n&quot;Johnny 99&quot; \n&quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; \n&quot;State Trooper&quot; \n&quot;Used Cars&quot; \n&quot;Open All Night&quot; \n&quot;My Father's House&quot; \n&quot;Reason to Believe&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn In The USA 1984\n\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. is the seventh studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on June 4, 1984. A critical and commercial triumph, it found Springsteen marking a departure in his sound. While the predecessor, the dark and acoustic Nebraska featured songs of pessimism and isolation, Born in the U.S.A.'s lyrics expressed signs of hope in the daily fight of the standard American in following the American Dream, a new feeling complemented by synthesized arrangements and a pop-flavored, radio-oriented sound that helped Springsteen to extend his popularity and appeal to mainstream audiences.[citation needed] The album was supported by an enormous commercial campaign that helped create several hit singles, as well as remixes and music videos.\n\nBorn in the U.S.A. was the best-selling album of 1985 in the United States (and also Springsteen's most successful album ever). The album produced a record-tying string of seven Top 10 singles (tied with Michael Jackson's Thriller and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814) and also a worldwide concert tour (the two-year Born in the U.S.A. Tour) that was a success. Apart from this hype, the album was lauded by most critics and is often considered Springsteen's magnum opus along with his 1975 breakthrough, Born to Run. The title track is often misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem. Its cover (a close-up of Springsteen's rear in front of an American flag, as he was photographed by Annie Leibovitz) became an iconic image of the era.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n2.\t&quot;Cover Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n3.\t&quot;Darlington County&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n4.\t&quot;Working on the Highway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n5.\t&quot;Downbound Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n6.\t&quot;I'm on Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n7.\t&quot;No Surrender&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n8.\t&quot;Bobby Jean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n9.\t&quot;I'm Goin' Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n10.\t&quot;Glory Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n11.\t&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n12.\t&quot;My Hometown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTunnel Of Love 1987\n\n\nTunnel of Love is the eighth studio album by Bruce Springsteen released in 1987. In 1998, Q magazine readers voted Tunnel of Love the 91st greatest album of all time. In 1989, the album was ranked #25 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;100 greatest albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 2003, the same magazine ranked it at number 475 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n&quot;Ain't Got You&quot; \n&quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot; \n&quot;All That Heaven Will Allow&quot; \n&quot;Spare Parts&quot; \n&quot;Cautious Man&quot; \n&quot;Walk Like a Man&quot; \n&quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; \n&quot;Two Faces&quot; \n&quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; \n&quot;One Step Up&quot; \n&quot;When You're Alone&quot; \n&quot;Valentine's Day&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Touch 1992\n\n\nHuman Touch is the ninth studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1992 (see 1992 in music). This album was co-released on the same day as Lucky Town. It was the more popular of the two, and one of his rarest albums it peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 and single release &quot;Human Touch&quot; (paired with Lucky Town's &quot;Better Days&quot;) peaked at #1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart and #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Human Touch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:31\n2.\t&quot;Soul Driver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n3.\t&quot;57 Channels (And Nothin' On)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n4.\t&quot;Cross My Heart&quot; (Springsteen, Sonny Boy Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n5.\t&quot;Gloria's Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n6.\t&quot;With Every Wish&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n7.\t&quot;Roll of the Dice&quot; (Springsteen, Roy Bittan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n8.\t&quot;Real World&quot; (Springsteen, Roy Bittan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n9.\t&quot;All or Nothin' at All&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n10.\t&quot;Man's Job&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n11.\t&quot;I Wish I Were Blind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n12.\t&quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n13.\t&quot;Real Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n14.\t&quot;Pony Boy&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucky Town 1992\n\n\nLucky Town is the tenth studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1992. This album was released on the same day as Human Touch. The title track was featured in the film Lucky You. Springsteen was working on Human Touch, which he intended to release sometime in 1990, but the project took him longer than he thought. He shelved the project in early 1991 and came back to it in September of the same year. Intending to record one more song for the album, he ended up with ten new songs, which became &quot;Lucky Town&quot;. Once he completed Lucky Town, he decided to release both albums at the same time.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Better Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n2.\t&quot;Lucky Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n3.\t&quot;Local Hero&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n4.\t&quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n5.\t&quot;Leap of Faith&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n6.\t&quot;The Big Muddy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n7.\t&quot;Living Proof&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n8.\t&quot;Book of Dreams&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n9.\t&quot;Souls of the Departed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n10.\t&quot;My Beautiful Reward&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ghost of Tom Joad 1995\n\n\nThe Ghost of Tom Joad is the eleventh studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). The album was recorded and mixed at Thrill Hill during the spring and summer of 1995. Musically and lyrically reminiscent of Springsteen's 1982 critically acclaimed album Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad received mostly favorable reviews. Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone called it &quot;Springsteen's best album in ten years,&quot; and considered it &quot;among the bravest work that anyone has given us this decade.&quot; However, it reached only #11 on the Billboard 200, breaking a string of eight consecutive Top 5 studio albums in the U.S for Springsteen. The album is mainly backed by acoustic guitar work and the lyrics on many of the tracks are a somber reflection of life in the mid-1990s in America and Mexico. Tom Joad is the protagonist of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Springsteen has commented that he was first inspired by John Ford's film of the novel. The album's release was followed by Springsteen's solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour.\n \nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n2.\t&quot;Straight Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n3.\t&quot;Highway 29&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n4.\t&quot;Youngstown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n5.\t&quot;Sinaloa Cowboys&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n6.\t&quot;The Line&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n7.\t&quot;Balboa Park&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n8.\t&quot;Dry Lightning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n9.\t&quot;The New Timer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n10.\t&quot;Across the Border&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n11.\t&quot;Galveston Bay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n12.\t&quot;My Best Was Never Good Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Tracks 1999\n\n\n18 Tracks is an album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 1999. All but three selections had been on the boxed set Tracks, released a half year before. This single album was intended to capture more casual fans[citation needed], and thus was oriented towards the shorter, more pop-oriented selections from Springsteen's vault.\n\n&quot;The Promise&quot;, a Darkness on the Edge of Town outtake that gained considerable reputation[citation needed] as Springsteen's ultimate[citation needed] tale of betrayal following live performances beginning in 1976 and even more so in 1978, was included in a newly-recorded version among the three new numbers after howls of outrage[citation needed] from the faithful for leaving it off Tracks. &quot;The Fever&quot; had been recorded in 1973 but never seriously considered for inclusion on an album; instead, it became familiar to progressive rock radio listeners as manager Mike Appel released it to such stations in 1974 and it became an underground hit.[2] It was also recorded by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. Obscure early-1990s Human Touch outtake &quot;Trouble River&quot; was the third &quot;new old&quot; cut.\n\nCommercial goals for the album were not met[citation needed], as it only reached #64 on the Billboard 200 album chart and became his first album not to receive a RIAA certification. It did modestly better on the UK charts.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Growin' Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n2.\t&quot;Seaside Bar Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n3.\t&quot;Rendezvous&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n4.\t&quot;Hearts of Stone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n5.\t&quot;Where the Bands Are&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n6.\t&quot;Loose Ends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n7.\t&quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n8.\t&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (Demo Version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n9.\t&quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n10.\t&quot;Lion's Den&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n11.\t&quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n12.\t&quot;Janey, Don't You Lose Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n13.\t&quot;Sad Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n14.\t&quot;Part Man, Part Monkey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n15.\t&quot;Trouble River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n\tRecorded at Soundworks West, LA on April 6, 1990\n16.\t&quot;Brothers Under the Bridge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n17.\t&quot;The Fever&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:35\n\tRecorded at 914 Sound Studios on May 16, 1973\n18.\t&quot;The Promise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n\tRecorded at Thrill Hill Recording on February 12, 1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rising 2002\n\n\nThe Rising is the 12th studio album by American recording artist Bruce Springsteen, released in 2002 on Columbia Records. In addition to being Springsteen's first studio album in seven years, it was also his first with the E Street Band in 18 years.[1] It is centered around Springsteen's reflections on the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nUpon its release, The Rising was a critical and commercial success, and hailed as the triumphant return for Springsteen. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of over 520,000 copies. With this, Springsteen became the oldest person to achieve a first-week sales of over a half of a million copies in the United States[citation needed]. The album also garnered a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2003; although nominated for the Album of the Year award as well, it was beaten by Norah Jones' debut album Come Away with Me. Title song &quot;The Rising&quot; was also a Grammy nominee and recipient.\n\nFor the year 2002, The Rising was one of only two albums to receive Rolling Stone's highest rating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ five stars ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the other being Beck's Sea Change. The magazine also ranked the album #15 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Decade.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Lonesome Day&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Into the Fire&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Waitin' on a Sunny Day&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Nothing Man&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Countin' on a Miracle&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Empty Sky&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Worlds Apart&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Further On (Up the Road)&quot; \n10.\t&quot;The Fuse&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Mary's Place&quot; \n12.\t&quot;You're Missing&quot; \n13.\t&quot;The Rising&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Paradise&quot; \n15.\t&quot;My City of Ruins&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevils &amp; Dust 2005\n\n\nDevils &amp; Dust is the 13th studio album by American recording artist Bruce Springsteen, and his third folk album (after Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad). It was released on April 25, 2005 in Europe and on April 26 in the US.

This is Springsteen's first and so far only album of non-Springsteen material and contains his interpretation of thirteen folk music songs made popular by activist folk musician Pete Seeger. Oddly, none of the selections were written by Pete Seeger. The record began in 1997, when Springsteen recorded &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year. Springsteen had not known much about Seeger given his rock and roll upbringing and orientation, and proceeded to investigate and listen to his music.[8] While playing them in his house, his 10-year-old daughter said, &quot;Hey, that sounds like fun,&quot; which caused Springsteen to get interested in further exploring the material and genre.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Old Dan Tucker&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Jesse James&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Mrs. McGrath&quot; \n4.\t&quot;O Mary Don't You Weep&quot; \n5.\t&quot;John Henry&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Erie Canal&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; \n8.\t&quot;My Oklahoma Home&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Shenandoah&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Pay Me My Money Down&quot; \n12.\t&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Froggie Went A-Courtin'&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic 2007\n\n\nMagic is the 15th studio album by Bruce Springsteen, released in 2007 on Columbia Records.

The album is also available as part of the box set The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story.[2][3] The 2 CD version of the release entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7.[4] It had been in production for many years and was originally scheduled to be released for the 30th anniversary in 2008. The Promise debuted at #16 on the Billboard 200, while the box set, The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story, debuted at #27.[5] Upon its release, The Promise received general acclaim from most music critics. &quot;Ain't Good Enough for You&quot;, a track from the album was added to BBC Radio 2 and 96.2 The Revolution's playlists at the end of 2010. It marked the last appearance of Clarence Clemons on a Bruce Springsteen/E Street Band album before his death on June 18, 2011, due to complications from a stroke.\n\nTracks: \n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\t&quot;Racing in the Street&quot; ('78) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:49\n2.\t&quot;Gotta Get That Feeling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n3.\t&quot;Outside Looking In&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:16\n4.\t&quot;Someday (We'll Be Together)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n5.\t&quot;One Way Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n6.\t&quot;Because the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n7.\t&quot;Wrong Side of the Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n8.\t&quot;The Brokenhearted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n9.\t&quot;Rendezvous&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n10.\t&quot;Candy's Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n1.\t&quot;Save My Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n2.\t&quot;Ain't Good Enough for You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n3.\t&quot;Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n4.\t&quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n5.\t&quot;It's a Shame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n6.\t&quot;Come On (Let's Go Tonight)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n7.\t&quot;Talk to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n8.\t&quot;The Little Things (My Baby Does)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n9.\t&quot;Breakaway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30\n10.\t&quot;The Promise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52\n11.\t&quot;City of Night&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Boss :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca2189318e86ffe0e8883d45c7f07d8a196954f","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Discography+1973+-+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca2189318e86ffe0e8883d45c7f07d8a196954f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,162,24,147,24,232,111,254,14,136,131,212,92,127,7,216,161,150,149,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
