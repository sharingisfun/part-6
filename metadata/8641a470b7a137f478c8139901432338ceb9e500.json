Ft. His n' Hers House\n\nKelsey and Matt have been friends and roommates for several years now. Recently, the two broke the cardinal rule: don't date your housemate. With all going well so far, they've decided to take the next big step in their relationship--building a tiny house. However, just because the quarters are about to get closer doesn't mean Kelsey and Matt are ready to share a room. Our challenge is to build a tiny house that still provides ample privacy for these two techy best friends turned lovebirds as their romance evolves. Other challenges include a separate sink and vanity areas, a video picture wall to showcase the couple's adventures, and ports for iPads and other devices throughout the house.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 13-Jul-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8641a470b7a137f478c8139901432338ceb9e500","amp;dn":"Tiny.House.Nation.S03E07.HDTV.x264-POKE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8641a470b7a137f478c8139901432338ceb9e500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,65,164,112,183,161,55,244,120,200,19,153,1,67,35,56,206,185,229,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
