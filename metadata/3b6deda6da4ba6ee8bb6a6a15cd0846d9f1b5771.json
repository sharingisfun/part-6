The first single from the album, &quot;Human&quot;, was released to radio on September 22, 2008, and became available for download on September 30, 2008.[5] The band performed &quot;Human&quot; and &quot;Spaceman&quot; on the October 4, 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live.[5] &quot;Spaceman&quot; was released for download on November 4, 2008.\n\nThe title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers.[6] When asked where it came from, Flowers replied, &quot;I don&amp;#039;t know. You wait for moments. I just wait for it to come, and I knew that [Day &amp; Age] was right when I had it.&quot; [7].\n\nIn an interview with The Quietus, Flowers said that songs on the album were inspired by Elton John, David Bowie and Lou Reed. He added that the track &amp;#039;Neon Tiger&amp;#039; came about when he &quot;was trying to write like MGMT&quot;. [8]\n\nThe Killers selected Paul Normansell to create the artwork for the album. He is slated to include with the album portraits of the band members themselves. These portraits can be seen at various parts of the &quot;Human&quot; video, as well as the cover of Day &amp; Age.\n\nOn the 19th of November, Day &amp; Age was released early on Japan&amp;#039;s iTunes store for download. It became available on torrent sites the same day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6deda6da4ba6ee8bb6a6a15cd0846d9f1b5771","amp;dn":"THE_KILLERS_-_DAY_%26_AGE_%5B2008%5D_%5BMP3%5D_%5B320_KBPS%5D_%5BSTEREO%5D_%5BUPLOAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6deda6da4ba6ee8bb6a6a15cd0846d9f1b5771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,109,237,166,218,75,166,238,139,182,166,161,92,208,132,109,159,27,87,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
