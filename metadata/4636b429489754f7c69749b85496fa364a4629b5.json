The film won several awards ... and even more hearts. Children loved the engaging plot and unforgettable characters, and adult Willows fans appreciated the film's high production values and reasonable authenticity to Grahame's story.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1990, five series of The Wind in the Willows were produced by the studio, providing a platform for ongoing adventures for the characters. The same highly-effective animation technique of latex puppets containing an articulate metal skeleton was utilised for the series.\n\nA second feature-length film entitled A Tale Of Two Toads was released in 1989.\n\nIn October 2008 The Wind in the Willows: The Complete Collection was released, an 11 DVD set containing all five television series and both films. Prior to the release of this box set, only series 1 and 2 and selected episodes from series 3 had been available on DVD.\n\n\nThis torrent contains DVD rips of everything from The Wind in the Willows: The Complete Collection comprising:\n\n1983 - Original The Wind in the Willows film (78 minutes)\n1984 - Television series 1 (260 minutes)\n1985 - Television series 2 (260 minutes)\n1985 - Television series 3 (260 minutes)\n1987 - Television series 4 (260 minutes)\n1989 - A Tale of Two Toads film (52 minutes)\n1990 - Television series 5 (260 minutes)\n\nEnglish subtitles are included for every episode and film.
