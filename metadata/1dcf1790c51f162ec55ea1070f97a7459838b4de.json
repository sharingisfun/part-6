Keiron was soon replaced by Tracy Tracy (born Tracy Cattell in Australia). Their career was also boosted when The Smiths singer Morrissey named them as one of his favourite bands. After a successful first album, which presented them with their UK Top 5 hit single &quot;Crash&quot; in early 1988 (and made the Top 3 in the U.S. Modern Rock Charts), their career began to fade in the early 1990s. They split in 1992 following the commercial failure of their final album, 1991's Galore. Their major rivals within the 'blonde pop' scene were Transvision Vamp and The Darling Buds, both of whom bore a similar look and sound.[citation needed]\n\nThe Primitives emerged from the independent scene of the mid-Eighties that begat, amongst others, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, the Soup Dragons and the Wedding Present. They shared a love of melody, the Sixties, fast Ramones-influenced guitars and the pop sensibility of the Buzzcocks and Orange Juice.\n\nDullaghan died in Coventry on 4 February 2009.\n\n\n\nThe Best Of The Primitives\n\nOriginal Release Date: 1996\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLabel: RCA Victor Europe\n\n\n1\tCrash (2:34)\n2 \tSpacehead (2:12)\n3 \tShadow (3:30)\n4 \tThru' The Flowers (2:32)\n5 \tNothing Left (3:06)\n6 \tOut Of Reach (2:21)\n7 \tSummer Rain (3:10)\n8 \tSick Of It (3:12)\n9 \tAll The Way Down (3:37)\n10 \tSecrets (2:31)\n11 \tCan't Bring Me Down (2:39)\n12 \tWay Behind Me (3:09)\n13 \tNoose (3:29)\n14 \tI Almost Touched You (2:42)\n15 \tYou Are The Way (3:33)\n16 \tLead Me Astray (3:18)\n17 \tSlip Away (2:25)\n18 \tGive This World To You (4:05)\n19 \tEmpathise (4:09)\n20 \tEarth Thing (4:21)\n21 \tAll The Way Down (Beat Version) (2:22)\n\nThe Primitives don't show up often. \nPLEASE SEED for a while to get this out there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dcf1790c51f162ec55ea1070f97a7459838b4de","amp;dn":"The+Primitives+-+The+Best+of+the+Primitives+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dcf1790c51f162ec55ea1070f97a7459838b4de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,207,23,144,197,31,22,46,197,94,161,7,15,151,167,69,152,56,180,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
