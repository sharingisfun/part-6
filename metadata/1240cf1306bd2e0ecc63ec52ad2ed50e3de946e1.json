It is a newly emerging supra-disciplinary field with huge commercial potential. Stimuli-responsive materials answer by a considerable change in their properties to small changes in their environment. Responsive materials are becoming increasingly more prevalent as scientists learn about the chemistry and triggers that induce conformational changes in materials structures and devise ways to take advantage of and control them. Responsive Materials and Method offers state-of-the-art of the stimuli-responsive materials and their potential applications.\nThis collection brings together novel methodologies and strategies adopted in the research and development of responsive materials and technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1240cf1306bd2e0ecc63ec52ad2ed50e3de946e1","amp;dn":"Responsive+Materials+and+Methods+%28Advance+Materials+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1240cf1306bd2e0ecc63ec52ad2ed50e3de946e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,64,207,19,6,189,46,14,204,99,236,82,173,46,213,14,61,233,70,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
