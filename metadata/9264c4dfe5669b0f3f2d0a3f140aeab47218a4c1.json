The Industrial Revolution has begun, factories are springing up across the country, and new technologies are transforming in the cities. But the old ways do not die easy.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I was not a bard or a djeli or an historian or a scribe and I was certainly not a sage, but that didn't mean I wasn't curiousÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nYoung Cat Barahal thinks she understands the world she lives in and her place in it, but in fact she is merely poised, unaware, on the brink of shattering events. Drawn into a labyrinth of politics involving blood, betrayal and old feuds, she will be forced to make an unexpected and perilous journey in order to discover the truth, not just about her own family but about an ancient secret lying at the heart of her world.\n\nCat and her cousin Bee are part of this revolution. Young women at college, learning of the science that will shape their future and ignorant of the magics that rule their families. But all of that will change when the Cold Mages come for Cat. New dangers lurk around every corner and hidden threats menace her every move. If blood can't be trusted, who can you trust?\n\n\nCold Fire (Spiritwalker #2) by Kate Elliott (September 6th 2011)\n\nOnly one thing is certain: when Hallows' Night comes, the Wild Hunt will ride - and it feeds on mortal blood.\n\nCat and her cousin Bee are caught in a maze of intrigue, treachery, and magic. Everyone seems to want something from them: the Cold Mages are trying to take them prisoner, and the warlord who wants to conquer all of Europa seems sure they have a special destiny to aid him whether they want to or not. Worse, hidden powers deep in the spirit world are rising, and they are the most dangerous of all. Cat must seek allies and figure out who she can trust in order to save the ones she loves. For if she doesn't, everything will be lost.\n\nCold Steel (Spiritwalker #3) by Kate Elliott (June 25th 2013)\n\nTrouble, treachery, and magic just won't stop plaguing Cat Barahal. The Master of the Wild Hunt has stolen her husband Andevai. The ruler of the Taino kingdom blames her for his mother's murder. The infamous General Camjiata insists she join his army to help defeat the cold mages who rule Europa. An enraged fire mage wants to kill her. And Cat, her cousin Bee, and her half-brother Rory, aren't even back in Europa yet, where revolution is burning up the streets.\n\nRevolutions to plot. Enemies to crush. Handsome men to rescue.\n\nCat and Bee have their work cut out for them. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9264c4dfe5669b0f3f2d0a3f140aeab47218a4c1","amp;dn":"The+Spiritwalker+Trilogy+by+Kate+Elliott+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9264c4dfe5669b0f3f2d0a3f140aeab47218a4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,100,196,223,229,102,155,15,63,45,10,63,20,10,234,180,114,24,164,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
