Gregoire Padro (2002).pdf\n\nISBN 0-306-46429-2\n\nIn the future, our energy systems will need to be renewable and sustainable, efficient and cost-effective, convenient and safe. Hydrogen has been proposed as the perfect fuel for this future energy system. The availability of a reliable and cost-effective supply, safe and efficient storage, and convenient end use of hydrogen will be essential for a transition to a Hydrogen Economy. Research is being conducted throughout the world for the development of safe, cost-effective hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that support and foster this transition. This book is a collection of important research and analysis papers on hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that were presented at the American Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in August 1999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375760e86f423218cb5543216d95187b2c942602","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Hydrogen+Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375760e86f423218cb5543216d95187b2c942602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,87,96,232,111,66,50,24,203,85,67,33,109,149,24,123,44,148,38,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
