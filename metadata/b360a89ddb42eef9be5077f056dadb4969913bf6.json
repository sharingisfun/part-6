Kay, a woman with cropped hair and a penchant for masculine dress, is renting a room from a Christian Science healer whose clients include a pensioner with a lame leg. The pensioner visits once a week in the company of a young man he calls his nephew, even though they're not related. This young man, who has recently been released from prison, is the brother of a woman whose long relationship with a married man is starting to unravel. She, in turn, shares her office at a matrimonial agency with a woman who is consumed with jealousy over the friendship between her lover, a female mystery writer, and a radio announcer, also female.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b360a89ddb42eef9be5077f056dadb4969913bf6","amp;dn":"Sarah+Waters-The+Night+Watch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b360a89ddb42eef9be5077f056dadb4969913bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,96,168,157,219,66,238,249,190,80,119,240,86,218,219,73,105,145,59,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
