A series of bloody, tragic and impossible crimes would suggest someone is carrying out copycat Jack the Ripper murders. The murders are investigated by our three unlikely heroes: Chandler, a fast-tracked, media savvy DI on his first big murder case; Miles, nearing retirement, a front-line, hard-bitten DS, and Buchan, the eccentrically brilliant Jack the Ripper tour guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db40c9cb5fa94143006e71ce96b394ec4c3d4ffd","amp;dn":"Whitechapel.Season.2.480p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db40c9cb5fa94143006e71ce96b394ec4c3d4ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,64,201,203,95,169,65,67,0,110,113,206,150,179,148,236,76,61,79,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
