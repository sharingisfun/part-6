It effectively split the Flaming Lips into two bands. On the one hand, you have the merry pranksters that have remained a constant in music-new feeds for the past decade, whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing rails with Ke$ha, beefing with Erykah Badu, or taking the concept of a physical album release to literal extremes. And then the other, you have a band that, over the past few years, has entered the most fiercely experimental, stridently anti-pop phase of its long and storied career. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just that the former aspect inevitably overshadows the latter-- even on the tours for 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s dark, disorienting Embryonic, volcanic salvos like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Worm MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“See the LeavesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ simply got subsumed into the LipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ usual onstage circus and became the backing soundtrack to more bunny-costume dances.\nBy Stuart Berman\nRead full review at http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Neo-psychedelia, experimental rock, space rock, dream pop, alternative rock, noise pop, post-punk (early)\nQuality: 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Look... the Sun Is Rising.mp3\n02 - Be Free, a Way.mp3\n03 - Try to Explain.mp3\n04 - You Lust.mp3\n05 - The Terror.mp3\n06 - You Are Alone.mp3\n07 - Butterfly (How Long It Takes to Die).mp3\n08 - Turning Violent.mp3\n09 - Always There... in Our Hearts.mp3\n10 - Sun Blows Up Today.mp3\n11 - All You Need Is Love.mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e04ecf02aef4df9430a61676bb42900b5566ba6","amp;dn":"%282013%29+The+Flaming+Lips+-+The+Terror+%5B320+kbps%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e04ecf02aef4df9430a61676bb42900b5566ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,4,236,240,42,239,77,249,67,10,97,103,107,180,41,0,181,86,107,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
