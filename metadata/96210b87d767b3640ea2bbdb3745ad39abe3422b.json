Rob Pronk and Lex Jasper provided the arrangements but Terry mostly performs his usual repertoire. The music swings despite the large number of musicians, and the focus is almost entirely on Terry, who sounds as joyful as usual. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Mean To Me\n02 - I'm An Old Cowhand\n03 - Candy\n04 - Blues For Jay\n05 - Samba De Orfeu\n06 - Gwen\n07 - Come Sunday\n08 - It Could Happen To You\n09 - Mood Indigo\n10 - Theme From 'The Flintstones'\n\nSplit with Medieval.\nEnjoy and share!
