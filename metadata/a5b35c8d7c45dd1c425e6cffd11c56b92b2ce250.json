These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.\n\nStargate SG-1\nSeason 6, episodes 1-22\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nAverage File Size: 600mb\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nAudio 1: English ac3 passthrough, 5.1 channel\nAudio 2: English Director's Commentary, Dolby Surround\n\nSubtitles: English srt (in MKV)\n\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!\n\n\np.s. I used subtitles that I found online.  I did re-sync and perform spot checks and they seem fine.  However I can't guarantee the accuracy of the subs since I didn't rip them myself.  Thanks to those who did.\n\np.s.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS: These files may not work properly with TSMuxer...use the MEncoder engine(default) instead. Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b35c8d7c45dd1c425e6cffd11c56b92b2ce250","amp;dn":"Stargate.SG-1.Season.6.x264.ac3.subs-HighQuality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b35c8d7c45dd1c425e6cffd11c56b92b2ce250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,179,92,141,124,69,221,28,66,94,108,255,209,28,86,185,43,44,226,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
