It's magnificently done, and the performances of the children match those of actors such as Sergi Lopez (whose role echoes that in Pan's Labyrinth), Eduard FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez and Marina Comas. Scenes such as the boy's father instructing him to uphold his ideals and walk tall, or a powerless mother pleading her husband's innocence, are familiar from more commercial films. Here they are brutally undermined until nothing is left but pitiless self interest. A chilling study of how war and poverty create monsters. \n\n\nTHE GREAT WINNER OF THE GOYA'S 2011 PRIZE (THE SPANISH &quot;OSCAR&quot;).\n\n\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH AND BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE.\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
