Magazines and DIY shows have touted the importance of updating hardware and now even famous designers are marketing their own door pulls, but with so many options home owners often don't know where to begin. Architectural Hardware focuses on all aspects of incorporating architectural hardware into the home history, styles, finishes, tips from the pros, how-to projects as well as room-by-room hardware design. In addition to a complete discussion of every facet of decorative hardware components for the home, Architectural Hardware also provides useful information on what to look for when shopping for hardware, such as hardware grades, safety codes to consider, security, as well as basic step-by-step installations instructions and room-by-room design tips from top designers, builders and architects.\n\n\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5029a2e1803350bedc6e78a8b7dbdd5f15a2524b","amp;dn":"Architectural+Hardware%3A+Ideas%2C+Inspiration%2C+and+Practical+Advice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5029a2e1803350bedc6e78a8b7dbdd5f15a2524b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,41,162,225,128,51,80,190,220,110,120,168,183,219,221,95,21,162,82,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
