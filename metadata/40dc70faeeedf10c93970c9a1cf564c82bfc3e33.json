Crouch presents details of his dabblings in the art without going into the theory behind the practices. Serious students of the arts will find this book lacking any real depth, and would be better served looking elsewhere, but it is a good introduction for those new to magic.\n\n\nNote: I will be adding many more titles soon, subscribe to my RSS feed at...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/01e1e80da7131a28ecc9392fa89798bf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/01e1e80da7131a28ecc9392fa89798bf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOr bookmark my TPB page at... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/EarthBow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/EarthBow&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs always, comments (good or bad) are appreciated\n\nKeywords: occult, esoteric, magic, magik, witchcraft, introduction to witchcraft, beginning witchcraft","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40dc70faeeedf10c93970c9a1cf564c82bfc3e33","amp;dn":"Occult+-+Complete+Course+in+Magic+%26+Witchcraft+%28pdf%29+EarthBow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40dc70faeeedf10c93970c9a1cf564c82bfc3e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,220,112,250,238,237,241,12,147,151,12,154,28,245,100,200,43,252,62,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
