In the five years since the married duo came upon the name Shovels &amp; Rope to describe the music they make from whateverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lying around the house, the pair has become a musical embodiment of how loving couples make it work: trading off instruments, forming loose and forgiving harmonies at the top of their lungs, and offering up songs that revel in lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy, comical moments and dented beauty. But Trent and Hearst have also always been interested in the common and the problematic, telling stories not about bicycles built for two, but of old cars that carry lovers who sometimes court disaster, or lonely people whom life hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t treated so well. In performance, Shovels &amp; Rope presents an ideal; on record, the band keeps it real and rough.\n\n\n\nSwimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time, the third Shovels &amp; Rope album, also gets wet. Liquid runs through these songs, which mostly take place in the South, with its rising rivers and weak levees and mysterious sinkholes. The title track doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t describe a vacation but an ominously creeping sea level, maybe one Hearst and Trent see on the estuary where they live in South Carolina. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stono River BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speaks for a subsistence fisherman who remembers the slave rebellion that once took place on that coastal channel, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coping MechanismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a doo-wop song about intravenous drug use. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thresher,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a philosophical ghost recounts a historic disaster, the sinking of a U.S. military submarine in 1963. There are also tales of people whose fates are as tricky as a current: petty criminals and homeless wanderers, happy couples who accept each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faults, a man under arrest who dolefully declares, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hit my kids, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nThe concept behind SwimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time never feels burdensome, because Hearst and Trent create such vivid characters and make such opulently open-ended music. With only two players Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus judicious additions from horn-playing multi-instrumentalist Nathan Koci Ã¢â‚¬â€ Shovels &amp; Rope touches upon hard blues, early soul, folk revivalism, Laurel Canyon rock and noirish theatricality. (Ã¢â‚¬Å“OhioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is like a lost song from Brecht and WeillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Threepenny Opera.) Trent produced SwimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time at the coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio, and he preserves the raggedness that, for this duo, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean sloppiness. Instead, he brings out a commitment to rhythms and harmonies that play with time and tune, as well as a determination to find the spots where that looseness is, as people said in the old days, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ragged but right.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I put the lines out in the water in the morning,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the fisher folk sings on SwimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be loaded by the end of the day.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Trent and Hearst sing the chorus like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an old gospel testimonial. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the spirit of Shovels &amp; Rope: If your spiritÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, hope comes cheap, and it will help even when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being pulled downward. On SwimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time, Hearst and Trent imagine a rough tide, but the human spirit both cultivate so well preaches not just survival, but also happiness on the other side of the swell.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c6d9833bde43a5414d6186585eb26b1844e1d3","amp;dn":"Shovels+%26amp%3B+Rope+-+Swimmin+Time+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c6d9833bde43a5414d6186585eb26b1844e1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,198,217,131,59,222,67,165,65,77,97,134,88,94,178,107,24,68,225,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
