The band has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide throughout their career. The group was inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Doobie Brothers is the debut album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1971 (see 1971 in music). It is their only official studio album to feature original bass player Dave Shogren on all tracks, who left during the recording of their second album. The album was re-released in 1974 on the Midi record label with colourised album artwork.\n\nThe first single from the album, &quot;Nobody,&quot; failed to chart, as did the album itself. The single was re-released in 1974 after the group had become a highly successful touring and recording act, peaking at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Nobody&quot; was later re-recorded for the group's 2010 album, World Gone Crazy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLivin' on the Fault Line is the seventh studio album by the American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1977. It is one of the few Doobie Brothers albums which did not produce a hit (although &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; was a hit as recorded by co-author Carly Simon). Still, the album received modest critical acclaim. Tom Johnston (guitar, vocals) left the band early in the sessions. He is listed as part of the band (appearing in the inside group photo) but appears on little or none of the actual album. Much of this consistently mellow album has a jazz tinge, and the influences of R&amp;B are palpable throughout. The track &quot;Little Darling (I Need You)&quot; is a remake of the Marvin Gaye 1966 hit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinute by Minute is the eighth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1978. The album contains their biggest hit, the Grammy-winning &quot;What a Fool Believes,&quot; which was co-written by Kenny Loggins and simultaneously released on his 1978 album Nightwatch. &quot;Depending on You&quot; and the title track were also released as singles. The album would be the last to include members Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and John Hartman.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne Step Closer is the ninth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1980. The album included the hit &quot;Real Love&quot;, which reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFarewell Tour is the first live album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1983. (see 1983 in music). It documents the group's 1982 Farewell Tour.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Doobie Brothers had evolved from the guitar-boogie sound under original band frontman Tom Johnston to a soulful keyboard-driven AOR sound under Michael McDonald. Despite the many personnel changes in the group, Patrick Simmons remained from the original incarnation of the group.\n\nIn 1982, Simmons decided to retire from the group after years of constant touring and recording. When the band decided to break up in light of his impending departure, Simmons encouraged the group to make one last tour during the summer of 1982 as a way of thanking the group's loyal fanbase. This tour became known as the &quot;Farewell Tour.&quot;\n\nThe front cover shows Keith Knudsen cutting the strings on John McFee's guitar as a symbolic gesture.[1] The last two songs on the album were recorded at the final concert of the tour in Berkeley, California, on September 11, 1982 with vocals by original lead vocalist and guitarist Tom Johnston. For a long time the album was available on CD only in Japan, but ultimately it was re-released on CD by Rhino/WEA on August 26, 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217db6d46542625bedac54b9b50a85b56d260743","amp;dn":"Doobie+Brothers-Original+Album+Series-Vol.2+%5B5CD%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217db6d46542625bedac54b9b50a85b56d260743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,125,182,212,101,66,98,91,237,172,84,185,181,10,133,181,109,38,7,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
