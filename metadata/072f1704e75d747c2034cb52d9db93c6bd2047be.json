Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\r\n\r\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end. \r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Win XP, 7, 8, Vista, 10\r\nProcessor: 2 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon or equivalent\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nHard Drive: 1 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072f1704e75d747c2034cb52d9db93c6bd2047be","amp;dn":"Five+Nights+at+Freddy+s+4+v1.1+%28Halloween+Update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072f1704e75d747c2034cb52d9db93c6bd2047be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,47,23,4,231,93,116,124,32,52,203,82,217,219,147,198,189,32,71,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
