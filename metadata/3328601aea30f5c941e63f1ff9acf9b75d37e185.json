Initially dubbed Roundabout, the group was first assembled as a session band for ex-Searchers drummer Chris Curtis but quickly went their own way, touring Scandinavia before beginning work on their debut LP, Shades of Deep Purple. The most pop-oriented release of their career, the album generated a Top Five American hit with its reading of Joe South's &quot;Hush&quot; but otherwise went unnoticed at home. The Book of Taliesyn followed (in the U.S. only) in 1969, again cracking the U.S. Top 40 with a cover of Neil Diamond's &quot;Kentucky Woman.&quot; \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nsource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Hush\n02.Kentucky Woman\n03.Black Night\n04.Speed King\n05.Child In Time\n06.Strange Kind Of Woman\n07.Fireball\n08.Demon's Eye\n09.Highway Star\n10.Smoke On The Water\n11.Space Truckin'\n12.Woman From Tokyo\n13.Burn\n14.Stormbringer\n15.Knocking At Your Back Door\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3328601aea30f5c941e63f1ff9acf9b75d37e185","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+The+Very+Best+Of++2001+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3328601aea30f5c941e63f1ff9acf9b75d37e185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,40,96,26,234,48,245,201,65,230,63,31,249,172,249,183,93,55,225,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
