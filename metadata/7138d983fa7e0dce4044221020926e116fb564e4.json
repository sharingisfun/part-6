Law's job is to take down other superheroes who have gone rogue, which he does with maximum force and great pleasure. Aided by the wheelchair-using Ã¢â‚¬Å“DannyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his physically imposing (but extremely polite) partner Ã¢â‚¬Å“KilotonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the Marshal operates from a secret police precinct hidden below the city, dispensing just enough brutal justice to keep the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many super-powered gangs in a balanced dÃƒÂ©tente while safeguarding the ordinary citizenry.\n\nMarshal Law's secret identity is Joe Gilmore, a former supersoldier consumed with self-hatred about being a superhero. In this world, superheroes are commonplace thanks to genetic engineering, much of the United States' armed forces having undergone the process. However, while their bodies may become super-powered, their minds remain exactly as they were, and in many cases the inability to feel pain causes the subjects to compensate by inflicting pain on others. Psychosis of varying degrees is also a common side-effect, and some subjects develop wildly uncontrollable superpowers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7138d983fa7e0dce4044221020926e116fb564e4","amp;dn":"Marshal+Law","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7138d983fa7e0dce4044221020926e116fb564e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,56,217,131,250,126,13,206,64,68,34,16,32,146,110,17,111,181,100,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
