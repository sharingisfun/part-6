The cast (Greg Timmermans, Marijke Pinoy and Laura Verlinden) and director Nic Balthazar were also there and gave a short explanation about the movie and their experience making it.\n\nI had multiple reasons to go see this film, First of all, I like the idea of using the gaming community (which is so common among us youngsters these days ) to illustrate ones need to escape the real world and enter their own. Secondly, I was curious about the performance of Greg Timmermans as Ben. I didn&amp;#039;t know it was his first movie until he himself said it, moments before it began. And finally, the movie became very famous when winning at the World Filmfestival in Montreal.\n\nLet me just say that this movie deserves every praise it got and will get. From beginning until end, you are moved by the world of Ben. His relation to his parents, &quot;friends&quot; , and the world itself.\n\nHe explains his feelings through his Gaming alter ego BenX in the game ArchLord, why he is who he is.\n\nEveryone was touched, seeing this movie and we gave it a standing ovation during the credits.\n\nSo go see this movie if you can, it&amp;#039;s definitely worth it and you won&amp;#039;t be disappointed.\n\nGreetings Rafke\n\nP.S. : You don&amp;#039;t have to be a &quot;gamer&quot; of just know a lot about gaming to understand this movie... everything is explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf90aaf3171d2ac0b58867b4995c7db0f0b4369b","amp;dn":"Ben+X+%282007%29+DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf90aaf3171d2ac0b58867b4995c7db0f0b4369b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,144,170,243,23,29,42,192,181,136,103,180,153,92,125,176,240,180,54,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
