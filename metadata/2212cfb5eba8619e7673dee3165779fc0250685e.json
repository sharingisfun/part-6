Along the way he stumbles through several attempts to make his markÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as a punk rock musician, a construction worker, a bouncer, and, tragically, a modern dancer.\n\nTo numb the pain of failure, Ferguson found comfort in drugs and alcohol, addictions that eventually led to an aborted suicide attempt. (He forgot to do it when someone offered him a glass of sherry.) But his story has a happy ending: in 1993, the washed-up Ferguson washed up in the United States. Finally sober, Ferguson landed a breakthrough part on the hit sitcom The Drew Carey Show, a success that eventually led to his role as the host of CBS's The Late Late Show. By far Ferguson's greatest triumph was his decision to become a U.S. citizen, a milestone he achieved in early 2008, just before his command performance for the president at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. In American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white, and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2212cfb5eba8619e7673dee3165779fc0250685e","amp;dn":"Craig+Ferguson+-+American+on+Purpose+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2212cfb5eba8619e7673dee3165779fc0250685e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,18,207,181,235,168,97,158,118,115,222,227,22,87,121,252,2,80,104,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
