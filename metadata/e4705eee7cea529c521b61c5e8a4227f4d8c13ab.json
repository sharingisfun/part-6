He and I share the goal of preventing animal cruelty while making vegans as healthy as possible. Maximum Nutrition: Transitioning towards a Plant Based Diet with Michael Greger, M.D. is a great tool for people who want their family or friends to learn more about a vegetarian diet in a convenient, entertaining way. And if you're like me, you'll also learn some valuable information about vegan nutrition and cooking!\n\nAnyone who has seen Dr. Greger speak knows he is entertaining, and his DVD lives up to his reputation. I found myself laughing out loud throughout.\n\nThe DVD covers the latest research on vegetarian diets and shows what vegans can eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, Dr. Greger gives some quick, helpful cooking demonstrations and recipes for salad dressing, hummus, and other dishes. It is filled with helpful meal ideas, cooking tips, and pointers on how people can eat to maximize their health.\n\nDr. Greger spends a lot of time rightfully pointing out the benefits of whole foods. He told me that he was gearing the DVD to people who tend to have poor diets. But many vegans who are thin, physically active, and/or have a high metabolism should feel safe eating processed foods such as white pasta in order to meet their daily energy needs.\n\nThe 2-hour DVD is packed with interesting dialogue from beginning to end.\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\n&quot;It is said that laughter is the best medicine. If so, Michael Greger's new DVD offers welcome relief to long-suffering seekers of nutritional wisdom. Based on cutting edge clinical research, this DVD is jam packed with practical recipes, cooking tips, and unpredictable belly laughs. Michael's contagious enthusiasm and zany humor make the how and why of cooking well and eating right into pure fun.&quot;\n-James LaVeck, Film producer (&quot;The Witness&quot;), Co-founder Tribe of Heart\n\n&quot;Michael Greger, M.D.'s new cooking show DVD is both informative and entertaining. Dr. Greger provides solid advice for achieving optimal health through proper nutrition, and he does so in his uniquely humorous and entertaining way. We highly recommend this DVD for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.&quot;\n-Gene and Lorri Bauston, Founders of Farm Sanctuary\n\n&quot;Dr. Michael Greger is an entertaining teacher, an enlightened doctor, an energetic vegan: the perfect prescription for an effective, educational presentation on healthy eating for yourself, the animals and the planet.&quot;\n-Carol J. Adams, Feminist-vegetarian author\n\n&quot;If ever a doctor was born for the theater, it's Michael Greger, M.D. Those who have seen Dr. Greger... know his distinctive flair for public speaking, his witty roller coaster delivery that makes it impossible to divert your attention from even the most complex nutritional topics... He delivers the nutritional case for veganism with memorable charm... So you may want to get a copy for yourself, plus a fun gift for someone who may be leaning toward plant-based nutrition (all proceeds from the DVD sales go to animal charities).&quot;\n-Vance Lehmkuhl, Political cartoonist and writer \n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nBuy kickass vegan goods online!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.veganessentials.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.veganessentials.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.veganstore.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.veganstore.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.downbound.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.downbound.ca&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.veganstore.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.veganstore.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mooshoes.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mooshoes.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beyondskin.co.uk/html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beyondskin.co.uk/html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ethicalwares.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ethicalwares.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bboheme.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bboheme.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*****************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4705eee7cea529c521b61c5e8a4227f4d8c13ab","amp;dn":"Maximum+Nutrition%3A+Transitioning+To+A+Plant-Based+Diet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4705eee7cea529c521b61c5e8a4227f4d8c13ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,112,94,238,124,234,82,156,82,27,97,197,232,164,34,127,77,140,19,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
