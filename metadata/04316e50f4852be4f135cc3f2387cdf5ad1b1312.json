He is known for writing about the history of his times, the late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE, especially for his account of the final years of the Peloponnesian War.  Xenophon's HELLENICA (translated here as A HISTORY OF MY TIMES) is considered to be the continuation of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War.  His youthful participation in the failed campaign of Cyrus the Younger to claim the Persian throne inspired him to write about the Persian empire and its history.\n\nOther than Plato, Xenophon is the foremost authority on Socrates, having learned under the great philosopher while a young man.  He greatly admired his teacher, and well after Socrates' death in 399 Xenophon wrote several Socratic dialogues, including an Apology concerning the events of his trial and death.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of ePUB and/or PDF formats as indicated:\n\n* CONVERSATIONS OF SOCRATES (Penguin Classics, 1990).
