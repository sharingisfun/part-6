American critics often compare sound to early R.E.M., but these guys were way ahead in the guitar artistry department. There are gorgeous, dreamy tunes here, notably &quot;No Explanation,&quot; &quot;A Month of Sundays,&quot; and &quot;Shadow Cabinet.&quot; Also present is easily the Church's worst song ever, &quot;Maybe These Boys.&quot; What was Steve Kilbey thinking? And first song &quot;Constant in Opal&quot; seems like it was created solely to give life to that dull pun. &quot;Violet Town&quot; is somewhat attractive, but marred by that harsh snare shot beat that compromised some of the tracks on the previous album, Seance. \n\nThe closing instrumental title track is depressing, but hints at future direction of the band. Oh, and Marty Willson-Piper gets a pair of somewhat awkward but refreshing efforts in with &quot;Volumes&quot; and &quot;10,000 Miles.&quot;\n\nThis album was basically strung together from two previous e.p. releases (Persia and Remote Luxury), which isn't surprising given the lack of cohesion of the record. Highly uneven, but instrumental in getting the Church more airplay on American college radio, paving the way for their Starfish breakthrough. And it is their first album to really approach excellence in a sublime way - in spots. \n\n\n\n1 Constant in Opal   3:31 \n2 Violet Town   3:30 \n3 No Explanation   4:30 \n4 10,000 Miles   4:17 \n5 Maybe These Boys...   5:52 \n6 Into My Hands   3:44 \n7 A Month of Sundays   4:25 \n8 Volumes   4:08 \n9 Shadow Cabinet   4:20 \n10 Remote Luxury   3:17 \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53db1d797de06962ba5ff9629fb94ba835f91944","amp;dn":"The+Church+-+Remote+Luxury+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53db1d797de06962ba5ff9629fb94ba835f91944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,219,29,121,125,224,105,98,186,95,249,98,159,185,75,168,53,249,25,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
