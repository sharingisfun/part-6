The complete details of each project are given, including the full circuit diagram and source code. The author explains how to program microcontrollers (in C language) with LED, LCD and GLCD displays; and gives a brief theory about the operation, advantages and disadvantages of each type of display.\n\nKey features:\n\n* Covers topics such as: displaying text on LCDs, scrolling text on LCDs, displaying graphics on GLCDs, simple GLCD based games, environmental monitoring using GLCDs (e.g. temperature displays)\n* Uses C programming throughout the book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the basic principles of programming using C language and introductory information about PIC microcontroller architecture will also be provided\n* Includes the highly popular PIC series of microcontrollers using the medium range PIC18 family of microcontrollers in the book.\n* Provides a detailed explanation of Visual GLCD and Visual TFT with examples.\n* Companion website hosting program listings and data sheets\n* Contains the extensive use of visual aids for designing LED, LCD and GLCD displays to help readers to understand the details of programming the displays: screen-shots, tables, illustrations, and figures, as well as end of chapter exercises\n\nUsing LEDs, LCDS, and GLCDs in Microcontroller Projects is an application oriented book providing a number of design projects making it practical and accessible for electrical &amp; electronic engineering and computer engineering senior undergraduates and postgraduates. Practising engineers designing microcontroller based devices with LED, LCD or GLCD displays will also find the book of great use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8315a543efb636b570992b590d2c5daa9c2c98ae","amp;dn":"Using+LEDs%2C+LCDs%2C+and+GLCDs+in+Microcontroller+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8315a543efb636b570992b590d2c5daa9c2c98ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,21,165,67,239,182,54,181,112,153,43,89,13,44,93,170,156,44,152,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
