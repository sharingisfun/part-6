(Watch out everyone, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to gush.) This is by far the best book IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen on writing a synopsis!! And like you and many others, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone nuts trying to get my synopsis to say what it needs to say in an interesting and concise way without making it a yawner. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also one of those authors who writes a rough synopsis as a road map after IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written about 3 chapters of a book to keep me on track. This book makes it so easy. If you buy one book on writing a synopsis, buy this one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Lisa Mondello, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Writing the Fiction Synopsis is destined to be a classic!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€ Karen Fox, RITA-nominated romance author.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24e08025bc87831a7b287e597ad60b8b22ed869","amp;dn":"Writing+the+Fiction+Synopsis+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24e08025bc87831a7b287e597ad60b8b22ed869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,78,8,2,91,200,120,49,167,178,135,229,151,173,96,184,178,46,216,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
