Just don't expect this freeware program to give you any coaching. In a typical session, you might start with the rudimentary (and rather dull) warm-up games and move on from there to the full-blown typing tests. TypingMaster offers only one kind of testing method--retyping a set text--though you can break up the monotony by supplying your own TXT files. The program can store results for several users and track their progress over several tests. At the end of each test, the program gives a brief performance evaluation, though we wish it also gave custom-tailored advice based on our typing patterns. Unfortunately, that feature is restricted to the for-pay version. In sum, TypingMaster Typing Test offers nothing to distinguish it from countless similar titles, and earns only a lukewarm recommendation from us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196102b4c378878f45527f9558300de906825e6b","amp;dn":"Typing+Master+Pro+v7.0.1.763","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196102b4c378878f45527f9558300de906825e6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,97,2,180,195,120,135,143,69,82,127,149,88,48,13,233,6,130,94,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
