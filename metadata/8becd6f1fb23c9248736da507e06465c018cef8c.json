Weaving fundamental skills into a progression of drills that hone technique in increasingly complex, demanding, and realistic fighting situations, the handbook aids fighters in developing the reflexes of a complete boxer and teaches the move from a process-and-react mentality to one of seeing-and-reacting. Hundreds of sequential images illustrate vital steps in the progressionâ€”from proper stance, effective footwork, and range to defense and counters, the importance of angles, and creating winning strategies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8becd6f1fb23c9248736da507e06465c018cef8c","amp;dn":"Boxing%27s+Ten+Commandments+%282007%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8becd6f1fb23c9248736da507e06465c018cef8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,236,214,241,251,35,201,36,135,54,218,80,126,6,70,92,1,140,239,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
