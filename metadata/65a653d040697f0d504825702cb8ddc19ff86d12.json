She clearly loved/loves him immensely. Consider how sick he was. (Listen to &quot;Pennyroyal Tea.&quot;) And remember that they were rock star junkies (no disrespect), being scrutinized under a microscope in an attempt to mass market them to an MTV audience Kurt never intended to be responsible for. It clearly wasn't her that upset him. Love and miss you Kurt! Love you Courtney! Never stop!!! (Listen to Hole's &quot;Dear God&quot; if you want to know how much Courtney has learned/grown.)\n\nOne more thing, I personally think this makes a great &quot;bible&quot;. Flip to a random page and see how Kurt's thoughts relate/can be applied to your current day/situation.\n\nxoxo\nJami (admittedly biased Seattle native)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a653d040697f0d504825702cb8ddc19ff86d12","amp;dn":"Kurt+Cobain+-+Journals+%28pdf%29+%28works+w%2F+iBooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a653d040697f0d504825702cb8ddc19ff86d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,166,83,208,64,105,127,13,80,72,37,112,44,184,221,193,159,248,109,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
