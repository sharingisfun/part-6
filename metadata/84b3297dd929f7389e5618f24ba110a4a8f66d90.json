Among the challenges are learning the EJB technology itself, learning how to use the development environment you have chosen for EJB development, and the testing of the EJBs. \n This EJB 3.1 Cookbook addresses all these challenges and covers new 3.1 features, along with explanations of useful retained features from earlier versions. It brings the reader quickly up to speed on how to use EJB 3.1 techniques through the use of step-by-step examples without the need to use multiple incompatible resources. The coverage is concise and to the point, and is organized to allow you to quickly find and learn those features of interest to you. \n The book starts with coverage of EJB clients. The reader can choose the chapters and recipes which best address his or her specific needs. The newer EJB technologies presented include singleton beans which support application wide needs and interceptors to permit processing before and after a target method is invoked. Asynchronous invocation of methods and enhancements to the timer service are also covered. \n The EJB 3.1 CookBook is a very straightforward and rewarding source of techniques supporting Java EE applications. \n\nWhat you will learn from this book \nCreate and use the different types of EJBs along with the use of the optional session bean business interface \nCreate a singleton session bean for application-wide use \nUse declarative and programmatic techniques for security, timer services, and transaction processing \nUse asynchronous session beans to complement message driven beans \nSupport aspect oriented features such as logging and data validation using interceptors \nUse EJBs in support of message based applications \nMaster the use of deployment descriptors and improved packaging options \nUse EJBs outside of the Java EE environment using the embeddable container","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b3297dd929f7389e5618f24ba110a4a8f66d90","amp;dn":"EJB+3.1+Cookbook+%28with+Code%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b3297dd929f7389e5618f24ba110a4a8f66d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,179,41,125,217,41,247,56,158,86,24,242,75,161,16,164,168,246,109,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
