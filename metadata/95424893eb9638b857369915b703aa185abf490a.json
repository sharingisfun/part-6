With this in mind, the Encyclopedia of Financial Models, 3 Volume Set has been created to help a broad spectrum of individualsÃ¢â‚¬â€ranging from finance professionals to academics and studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€understand financial modeling and make use of the various models currently available.\n\nIncorporating timely research and in-depth analysis, the Encyclopedia of Financial Models is an informative 3-Volume Set that covers both established and cutting-edge models and discusses their real-world applications. Edited by Frank Fabozzi, this set includes contributions from global financial experts as well as academics with extensive consulting experience in this field. Organized alphabetically by category, this reliable resource consists of three separate volumes and 127 entriesÃ¢â‚¬â€touching on everything from asset pricing and bond valuation models to trading cost models and volatilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and provides readers with a balanced understanding of today's dynamic world of financial modeling.\n\nThis 3-Volume Set contains coverage of the fundamentals and advances in financial modeling and provides the mathematical and statistical techniques needed to develop and test financial models\nEmphasizes both technical and implementation issues, providing researchers, educators, students, and practitioners with the necessary background to deal with issues related to financial modeling\nEach volume includes a complete table of contents and index for easy access to various parts of the encyclopedia\nFinancial models have become increasingly commonplace, as well as complex. They are essential in a wide range of financial endeavors, and this 3-Volume Set will help put them in perspective.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVOLUME 1\n\nAsset Allocation\n\nMean-Variance Model for
