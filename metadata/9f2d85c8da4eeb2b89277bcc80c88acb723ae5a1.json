Mark Hollis' songs exist far outside of the pop idiom, drawing instead on ambient textures, jazz-like arrangements, and avant-garde accents; for all of their intricacy and delicate beauty, compositions like &amp;quot;Inheritance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I Believe in You&amp;quot; also possess an elemental strength Ã¢â‚¬â€ Hollis' oblique lyrics speak to themes of loss and redemption with understated grace, and his hauntingly poignant vocals evoke wrenching spiritual turmoil tempered with unflagging hope. A singular musical experience.\nSearch for KingStar to find my torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f2d85c8da4eeb2b89277bcc80c88acb723ae5a1","amp;dn":"Talk+Talk+-+Spirit+of+Eden+%40256+Kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f2d85c8da4eeb2b89277bcc80c88acb723ae5a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,45,133,200,218,78,235,43,137,39,123,204,128,200,138,203,114,58,229,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
