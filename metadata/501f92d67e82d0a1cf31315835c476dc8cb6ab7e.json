Includes liner \nnotes by Malcolm Dome.\n\nLike Journey and Styx, REO Speedwagon was a '70s rock band \nthat scored its biggest hits with radio-friendly rock and l\novesick power ballads during the early '80s. Rock dudes \ncould easily identify with guitarist Gary Richrath's crunchy \npower chords, while the girls could find solace in singer \nKevin Cronin's delicate tales of the ups and downs of love.\n\nOn the 1988 compilation THE HITS, the best of REO Speedwagon's \nboth worlds are featured--rocking standouts like \n&quot;Ridin' the Storm Out&quot; and &quot;Roll with the Changes,\n&quot; as well as such softer fare as &quot;Keep on Lovin' You&quot; and \n&quot;Can't Fight This Feeling.&quot; Although one of their biggest hits, \n&quot;Keep the Fire Burnin',&quot; is strangely absent, THE HITS is by \nand large a well-assembled collection of REO's biggest hits.\n\nAdditional personnel includes: \nEric Persing (synthesizer, programming); \nTommy Funderburk (background vocals).\n\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\n\nProducers include: \nKeith Olsen, Kevin Cronin, Gary Richrath, \nPaul Grupp, Kevin Beamish.\n\nReissue producer: Al Quaglieri.\n\nREO Speedwagon includes: Kevin Cronin (vocals, guitar); \nGary Richrath (guitar); Neal Doughty (keyboards, synthesizer); \nBruce Hall (bass); Alan Gratzer (drums).\n____________________\n\n1   I Don't Want To Lose You\n  \n2   Here With Me\n  \n3   Roll With The Changes\n  \n4   Keep On Loving You\n  \n5   That Ain't Love\n \n6   Take It On The Run \n \n7   In My Dreams\n\n8   Don't Let Him Go\n  \n9   Can't Fight This Feeling\n    \n10   Keep Pushin'\n \n11   Time For Me To Fly \n\n12   One Lonely Night\n\n13   Back On The Road Again\n \n14   Ridin' The Storm Out\n\n_________________________\n\nMp3\n\nRippped:320kbs\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501f92d67e82d0a1cf31315835c476dc8cb6ab7e","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+The+Hits+CD%28MP3+320KBS%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501f92d67e82d0a1cf31315835c476dc8cb6ab7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,31,146,214,126,130,208,161,207,49,49,88,53,196,118,220,140,182,171,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
