Spanning the entire continent, and covering the major upheavals more or less chronologicallyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the promising era of independence to the most recent spate of infamies (Rwanda, Darfur, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Sierra Leone)Ã¢â‚¬â€Meredith (In the Name of Apartheid) brings us on a journey that is as illuminating as it is grueling. The best chapters, not surprisingly, deal with the countries that Meredith knows intimately: South Africa and Zimbabwe; he is less convincing when discussing the francophone West African states. Nowhere is Meredith more effective than when he gives free rein to his biographer's instincts, carefully building up the heroic foundations of national monuments like Nasser, Nkrumah, and Haile SelassieÃ¢â‚¬â€only to thoroughly demolish those selfsame mythical edifices in later chapters. In an early chapter dealing with Biafra and the Nigerian civil war, Meredith paints a truly horrifying picture, where opportunities are invariably squandered, and ethnically motivated killings and predatory opportunism combine to create an infernal downward spiral of suffering and mayhem (which Western intervention only serves to aggravate). His point is simply that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutelyÃ¢â‚¬â€which is why the rare exceptions to that rule (Senghor and Mandela chief among them) are all the more remarkable. Whether or not his pessimism about the continent's future is fully warranted, Meredith's history provides a gripping digest of the endemic woes confronting the cradle of humanity.\n\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nChapter 1 - THE GOLD COAST EXPERIMENT\nChapter 2 - REVOLT ON THE NILE\nChapter 3 - LAND OF THE SETTING SUN\nChapter 4 - L ' AFRIQUE NOIRE\nChapter 5 - WINDS OF CHANGE\nChapter 6 - HEART OF DARKNESS\nChapter 7 - THE WHITE SOUTH\nPART II\nChapter 8 - THE BIRTH OF NATIONS\nChapter 9 - THE FIRST DANCE OF FREEDOM\nChapter 10 - FEET OF CLAY\nChapter 11 - A HOUSE DIVIDED\nChapter 12 - DEATH OF AN EMPEROR\nChapter 13 - THE COMING OF TYRANTS\nChapter 14 - IN SEARCH OF UJAMAA\nChapter 15 - THE PASSING OF THE OLD GUARD\nChapter 16 - THE SLIPPERY SLOPE\nChapter 17 - THE GREAT PLUNDERER\nChapter 18 - WHITE DOMINOES\nPART III\nChapter 19 - RED TEARS\nChapter 20 - FAULT LINES\nChapter 21 - THE SCOURGE OF AIDS\nChapter 22 - THE LOST DECADE\nChapter 23 - THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY\nChapter 24 - A TIME OF TRIUMPH\nPART IV\nChapter 25 - IN THE NAME OF THE PROPHET\nChapter 26 - BLACK HAWK DOWN\nChapter 27 - THE GRAVES ARE NOT YET FULL\nChapter 28 - WHERE VULTURES FLY\nChapter 29 - BLOOD DIAMONDS\nChapter 30 - NO CONDITION IS PERMANENT\nChapter 31 - THE HONOUR OF LIVING\nChapter 32 - BLACK GOLD\nChapter 33 - A DEGREE IN VIOLENCE\nChapter 34 - SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW\nChapter 35 - OUT OF AFRICA\nCHAPTER NOTES\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\nINDEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:220447aac669bcf76e08ba31e09732ef699149b0","amp;dn":"The+Fate+of+Africa+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"220447aac669bcf76e08ba31e09732ef699149b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,4,71,170,198,105,188,247,110,8,186,49,224,151,50,239,105,145,73,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
