This is the book every photographer needs to own in order to create the outstanding images they always wanted to - but didn't know how.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb492860df40fdf7c110b16c5099c6d94e027625","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Photographic+Composition+A+Visual+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb492860df40fdf7c110b16c5099c6d94e027625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,73,40,96,223,64,253,247,193,16,177,108,80,153,198,217,78,2,118,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
