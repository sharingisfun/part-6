A mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record Buffalo Springfield (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.\nDistrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album, Buffalo Springfield Again, was released in late 1967, but two of YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.\nIn many ways, these three songs on Buffalo Springfield Again are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. &quot;Mr Soul&quot; is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; was a lushly produced ballad featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track, Jack Nitzsche, would dub &quot;symphonic pop.&quot;\nIn May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album, Last Time Around, was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs &quot;On the Way Home&quot; and &quot;I Am a Child&quot;, singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0753ef0ae43648ca05d16dcb881260c72d70fced","amp;dn":"Buffalo+Springfield-8+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0753ef0ae43648ca05d16dcb881260c72d70fced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,83,239,10,228,54,72,202,5,209,109,203,136,18,96,199,45,112,252,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
