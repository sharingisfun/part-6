I certainly hope the hiatus has paid off.\n\nMulti-platinum rock band BUSH return with their highly anticipated new album\nThe Sea Of Memories Recorded with producer Bob Rock (Aerosmith, Metallica).\nTHE SEA OF MEMORIES is the seminal bands first studio release in 10 years.\nTHE SEA OF MEMORIES captures the electricity and trademark intensity of\nclassic Bush delivered in a setting that is fresh and alive. Songs like The\nSound of Winter, Heart of the Matter and All Night Doctors are propelled by\nheavy guitar and hypnotic beats, simple song structures and sublime\ntextures. About the album, Rossdale says, When making music, you have a\nchoice to repeat what you ve done or move on. It wouldve been safe to just\nrework (1994s debut album) Sixteen Stone over and over, but what kind of\nlife would that be? When youre driving down the road, youre focused on whats\nin front of you; you don t really think to keep checking in your rear view\nmirror. I like the idea of art changing, developing and morphing.\n\nStripped by HeXagon's Advanced NFO Stripper: http://www.stripnfo.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a76f585b486fc8382555d3ba8ed803ae49890dc","amp;dn":"Bush-The_Sea_Of_Memories-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a76f585b486fc8382555d3ba8ed803ae49890dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,118,245,133,180,134,252,131,130,85,93,59,168,237,128,58,228,152,144,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
