The sound quality is incredible. Actually, the only negative thing I can really say about it is that sometimes it just sounds TOO clean. But that does not take away from the overall quality. I don't understand why anyone would even bother with Phil's HITS cd when they could have this! 1) Unlike HITS, &quot;Do you Remember&quot; and &quot;Don't Lose my number&quot; are both here! And they sound great! 2) Serious Hits Live has ALL the same songs as HITS except &quot;Dance into the Light,&quot; &quot;Both Sides,&quot; &quot;True Colors&quot; (no big loss so far) and &quot;I Wish it Would Rain Down.&quot; 3) Every song that appears on both HITS and Serious Hits Live sounds twice as good on the latter!\nThe only sound argument, in my opinion, for buying HITS instead of Serious Hits Live is that &quot;I Wish it Would Rain Down&quot; is only on HITS. And that is truly one of his best songs, perhaps my overall favorite Phil song. But all other arguments are [junk]. Every song sounds great here. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; is truly breathtaking, gives me chills every time I hear it. Songs like &quot;One More Night,&quot; &quot;Don't Lose My Number,&quot; &quot;Sussudio,&quot; and especially &quot;Separate Lives&quot; are seriously 5 times better than the respective originals (seriously...get it?).\n\nJust as a side-bar, Phils vocals sound much better here than on any live Genesis album (and I have them all). I think it's because his solo stuff has always meant more to him personally than the stuff Genesis did. Sometimes on Genesis live albums, for no apparent reason Phil will start singing with some weird Turkish-like accent which is really annoying (Genesis fans know what I'm talking about...and I don't just mean on &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3581e14be5a4232db3ef3d740b37f9de42720c6","amp;dn":"Phil+Collins+-+Serious+Hits...Live%21+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3581e14be5a4232db3ef3d740b37f9de42720c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,88,30,20,190,90,66,50,219,62,243,215,64,179,127,157,228,39,32,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
