Having trekked the globe to study creatures and their unique ecosystems, Dave has walked the line between the wild and human world to explore the delicate balance between wildlife and civilization. \nFrom the people behind the stunning natural history series, PLANET EARTH and North America, Deadly Islands sees Dave's skills tested to the limits as he lives alongside some of Mother Nature's fiercest predators. Dave visits some of the world's most remote islands to investigate how and why their native inhabitants have been so spectacularly successful at surviving - despite the harshest of conditions. In a unique approach that blends all the splendour of a natural history documentary series with an incredible investigative twist, audiences follow Dave as detective while he sets out to crack some of the last big secrets surrounding some of the world's most successful natural-born killers. Only by venturing closer than most would dare to some of the planet's most dangerous animals-from the great hammerhead shark to the grizzly bear- \nCan Dave uncover their secrets. How have they come to thrive so spectacularly in these remote places, often in confined island settings? Dave's skills will be tested to the limits as he lives alongside some of Mother Nature's fiercest predators, on some of the world's most remote islands, all to solve the Deadly Islands.\n\n\n1)  Killer Whale Island \nAnimal trainer Dave Salmoni explores the most hostile islands, and begins by travelling to a remote speck of land in the south Atlantic - which is visited by a large number of killer whales. Right from the off, this nature documentary featuring action-man biologist Dave Salmoni is manly stuff. As he speeds onto the beach in his beanie hat to study the Falklands' dwindling elephant seal population, it feels more like Saving Private Ryan than Life on Earth. But the battle he's come to observe on this rugged, windswept landscape isn't, for once, anything to do with humans. It's between seals and killer whales, and it's a fight that yields some dramatic footage. &quot;That's a big f***ing fin!&quot; shouts Dave as he spots an orca's towering dorsal protruding from the water. He's right. But I don't think Attenborough would have put it quite like that.\n\n2)  Grizzly Bear Island \nBiologist and predator specialist Dave Salmoni journeys to a mountainous island in the north-east Pacific, which is home to a large number of grizzly bears.\n\n3)  Shark Island \nBiologist and predator specialist Dave Salmoni journeys to an island in the South Pacific, which is home to a large concentration of sharks. But can he reveal why?\n\n4)  Volcano Island \nBiologist Dave Salmoni ventures to a deadly island in the legendary Galapagos Archipelago, in search of some of the weirdest and toughest animals on the planet.\n\n5)  Devils Island \nHost Dave Salmoni visits one of the world's most pristine rainforest islands. It is a shining green jewel off the coast of Panama, but this island has a dark secret.\n\n6)  Deadliest Moments \nDave Salmoni reveals the hardship and dangers - not to mention the broken equipment - he and his team had to contend with during the filming of the series.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/1584/9m4a.jpg&quot;
