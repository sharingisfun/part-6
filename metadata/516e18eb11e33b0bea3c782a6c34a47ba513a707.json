Resnais' purpose was to tell the truth about life in these camps, choosing to narrate the experience and juxtapose that narration with stark images of the abandoned and desolate remnants of these once where camps.\nIn just 31 minutes, the impact of Resnais' film is unmistakable. Edited amongst the camp grounds footage are segments of the Nazi footage showing the result of their dehumanisation of the prisoners, large masses of cut human hair, used to make rope for the army, room full of personal items, thousands of shoes and glasses etc. The description of these images may not seem shocking but believe me viewing the footage in the context of the narration raises disturbing images within one's own mind. That's where this documentary succeeds where many fail.\nResnais' film sometimes feels less like a documentary and more like an eyewitness account. The crimes have already been committed, it does not point the finger, it is on all accounts unbiased. Resnais simply lays it out for the record what happened and challenges those who watch this film to search within their own humanity and to learn from the mistakes of the past.\nThis is powerful filmmaking that challenges our hearts and minds by presenting an objective picture of the events that occurred in these camps. This is one of the most, if not important documents made on this subject.\n\nThe DVD:\n\nQuote:\nVideo: Presented in the film's original full frame ratio this 1.33:1 transfer has been given one hell of a work over by The Criterion Collection. Their booklet states that:\nThis new high-definition digital transfer was created on a spirit datacine from 35mm interpositives. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI digital restoration system. And the evidence is shown on this great disc, one of the best restoration jobs the Criterion Collection has done.\n\nAudio: This rip offers the film in its original French language in mono, and music only which I (the ripper) prefer with the English subs. Like the transfer the audio was also given a clean-up, the original 35mm optical positive soundtrack was mastered in 24-bit and was restored utilising tools that helped reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle. Although not the best sound result, it could be clearer but for a 49 year-old film I'm not going to complain since this is probably the best condition the sound has ever been in. \n\nOVERALL:\nIn the liner notes essay it is quoted that Francois Trouffat says that Night and Fog was &quot;The greatest film ever made&quot; This is certainly an important and powerful documentary that displays the facts in an objective fashion. The Criterion Collection has presented the film wonderfully in a newly restored DVD.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafdaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafdaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laaffaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laaffaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafgaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafgaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafhaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafhaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafjaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafjaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafkaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafkaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laaflaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laaflaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafoaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafoaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafpaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/laafpaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/maafaaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/maafaaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/maafcaacb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/maafcaacb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---my rip, from Criterion, with dual audio------\n\n~~~~~~ Nuit et brouillard.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................532,504,576                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................31:52.520                \nFrame Count:....................................45855             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................592                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.370                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1829                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.298&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................1           \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
