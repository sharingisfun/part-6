The church bells call people to the Mass, but the army officer Arnost is still sleeping in his austere and shabby room in the barracks. He wakes slowly, and attunes himself step by step to the world and what to do this arid Sunday. He loads his pistol and puts it to his head and in his mouth, without firing it off. While he turns around, he is now and then interrupted by short flashbacks in his memory of situations with frivolous women and much drinking, as well as some daydreams about enforced weddings. He has a relationship with three blond women. Two of them are adult. One is willowy and a bit aloof, the other voluptuous and possessive. The third is a little girl, who he likes to talk with. He goes to the gatekeeper of the barracks, and starts a chat. Through a spyglass he suddenly sees two young women sunbathing topless. As it is within the military area, he orders the gatekeeper to arrest them. The women don't take him seriously, but he writes a report. In front of the gatekeeper he pretends to have forgotten his wallet. The gatekeeper lends him some money, and he goes to a bar to have a drink together with the voluptuous blond woman. He gets drunk, she wants him to come to her dwelling, but he brushes her off brusquely. Completely drunk, back in his bed, he has a bright vision of the other two blond women. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : ZabitÃƒÂ¡ nedele.1969.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 412 Kbps\nLength            : 1.32 GiB for 1h 18mn 30s 520ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 210 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : cs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125600/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125600/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio Language: Czech\nSubtitles: English, Czech, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eacef682703c190a3aae5c0c44cd3762c35512f9","amp;dn":"Zabit%26aacute%3B+nedele+AKA+Squandered+Sunday+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eacef682703c190a3aae5c0c44cd3762c35512f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,206,246,130,112,60,25,10,58,174,92,12,68,205,55,98,195,85,18,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
