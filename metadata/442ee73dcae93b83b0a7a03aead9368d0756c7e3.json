The Minister for Magic has decided to teach courses in defensive magic, but this leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot;, Harry has taken it upon himself to teach them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.\n\nWith the ability to play multiple characters (including Harry Potter, Dumbledore and Sirius Black) this Harry Potter videogame offers fans the opportunity to wield a wand, explore all around Hogwarts, and experience one of the most exciting and dangerous years in the life of the Boy Who Lived.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442ee73dcae93b83b0a7a03aead9368d0756c7e3","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+And+The+Order+Of+The+Phoenix+%5BMAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442ee73dcae93b83b0a7a03aead9368d0756c7e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,46,231,61,202,233,59,131,176,167,160,58,234,217,54,141,7,86,199,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
