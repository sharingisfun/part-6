No matter what size or shape you are, wearing garments that fit perfectly makes you look and feel better.

The fabric is manipulated to improve the fit, and then those specific changes are made to the pattern. The result: patterns that fit perfectly!\n\nWith The Complete Photo Guide to Perfect Fitting, you'll learn:\n- The importance of a fitting axis and how to use it during a fitting\n- How to recognize fitting issues, such as drag lines and folds\n- How to manipulate fabric to solve common and unusual fitting problems\n- How to transfer the fitting changes to your pattern easily\n- Basic pattern-making skills to ensure accurate alterations\n\nSee the fitting process from start to finish on basic garments, fitted on real people. Then follow fitting solutions on different body types. The lessons you learn will help you fit any body.\n\nAbout the Author\nSarah Veblen is a custom fashion designer who focuses on teaching, creating clothing for her clientele, patternmaking and design consultation for young designers, and writing in several venues.
