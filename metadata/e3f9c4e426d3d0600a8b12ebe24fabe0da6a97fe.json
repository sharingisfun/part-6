I waited in line at midnight, got my box set and raced home to watch them. switched on my cinema system (luckily the neighbours were away) , loaded the DVD and prepared to be blown away. Then the film started and my face dropped. What the hell have they done to the surround mix? OMG LukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saber is green &amp; DarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is pink. I thought these editions would have been better than my old VHS ones. Yes the picture quality is far superior but the new faults just plain ruined them for me. So I decided that the original trilogy DVDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s need fixing but just never got round to doing it until i was amazed by the ADigitalMan/ Darth Editous Hybrid DVD . I loved it so much i wanted to make my own.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENT:\n\nStar Wars for the 21st Century. Two years in the making, this fan edit was created by a fan for the fans.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStar Wars: Revisited represents perhaps the boldest and most sophisticated of any of the fan edits of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Inspired by the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, fan editor Adywan has created a breathtaking and powerful version of the film. Star Wars: Revisited not only fixes errors and technical limitations to the film that should have been made in the first Special Edition, but gives us a whole new vision for the movie, tying it to the rest of the Star Wars saga while correcting many of the excesses of the original Special Edition. Shots are re-mastered and restored, special effect shots are re-composited and whole new sequences are created, giving the viewer a taste of what the Special Edition could have been. Accompanied by a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, Star Wars: Revisited provides an exciting new visit to a galaxy far, far away.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ synopsis by Sluggo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Originaltrilogy.com\n\nCUTLIST:\n\n    1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Star Wars Logo: originally it receded way too quickly so this has been slowed down to match the speed in the rest of the saga.\n    2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The crawl appears slightly earlier now, as it did pre ANH, so it appears at the correct music cue that WilliamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ intended, and how I remember it.\n    3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As the camera pans down to Tatooine you now see the 3 moons instead of just 2\n    4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tatooine now rotates slightly as the ships fly overhead\n    5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-coloured all lasers\n    6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the horrible blue hazing as the stardestroyers engine come into view\n    7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Changed the explosion as the Tantive IV is hit to remove a lot of the smoke.\n    8 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added a jerk to the motion of the Tantive IV as it is hit\n    9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Speeded up the star field in that shot so the Tantive IV seems to be moving as fast as it did in previous shots.\n    10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Colour correction of the whole film to remove the blue tint. The Tantive IVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s walls are now white.\n    11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-coloured R2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dome lights throughout the movie so they match closer to the rest of the saga. The front light now blinks from red to blue.\n    12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-edited the Tantive IV corridor battle to fix continuity issues where troopers die more than once.\n    13- Added blaster flashes to all blasters that have them missing as they fire.\n    14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added blast flashes to the troopers where they are hit\n    15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Corrected issues where the blasters flash as if they were fired on set but no laser bolts were present. Added the lasers to fix this throughout.\n    16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the jump cut where 3PO &amp; R2 cross the corridor on the Tantive IV &amp; the doorway explodes.\n    17 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When Vader enters the Tantive IV a Stormtrooper lets go of the head of a dead trooper but that you can see that the actor slowly lowers his head. This has been fixed and the troopers head now drops at speed more like a dead body.\n    18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added blinking lights to VaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chest plate\n    19 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ VaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes re-coloured to remove the red tint.\n    20 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When 3PO is looking for R2 a trooper falls to the floor behind him as if he has been shot but there is no laser fire. Added some lasers &amp; a flash as the trooper is hit.\n    21 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Smoothed / fixed the jump cut as R2 extends his third leg and heads for 3PO &amp; the one where he leaves 3PO\n    22 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the error in the scene where Vader is strangling Antilles the trooper in the background changes position in one shot. Originally his legs are closed and his blaster is in a totally different position.\n    23 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed an FX issue when Leia is hit by the stun blaster the glow effect is missing on part of her dress.\n    24 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the scene where R2 presses the button to open the pod door you now see his arm retract\n    25 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-coloured the interior of the escape pod to blue due to continuity issues in this scene.\n    26 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As the escape pod blasts off it now begins to rotate as it does in the rest of the shots\n    27 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When the imperial commander says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhold your fireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the trajectory of the escape pod has been changed so it is heading downwards and away from the ship instead or just heading straight which caused a continuity error in the next shot as we see the underbelly of the stardestroyer , which means it was heading downwards.\n    28 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Changed the stars &amp; stardestroyer view from inside the pod so the ship &amp; stars now recede at different rates\n    29 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You now see the escape pod enter the atmosphere of Tatooine.\n    30 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Every FX shot has been either touched up or redone in some form or another, but too many to mention every one.\n    31 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ On Tatooine the escape pod canopy has been re-coloured to remove the odd blue colour\n    32 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the some scenes the sky has been changed to match other shots.\n    33 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the sandcrawler from the OUT to replace the static shots when 3P0 thinks he is rescued\n    34 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Completely new canyon wipe so the rocky surroundings that R2 travels through matches closer to what Tatooine looks like in the PT. Also brightened the scene slightly\n    35 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed a shot of R2 after he is captured where you see the mark of a restraining bolt before it is attached. In some previous shots it is also somewhat visible but I was unable to fix this.\n    36 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed a placement continuity error with the restraining bolt that the Jawas fix to R2\n    37 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added a battle droid to the scrap inside the Sandcrawler. Also brightened up the inside scenes Fixed\n    38 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed R2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eye dome in the shot inside the sandcrawler where it looks like you can see Kenny Baker inside.\n    39 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Inside the sandcrawler 3POÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes blink as he stands. Fixed\n    40 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-coloured the sky in the SE shots of the sandtroopers &amp; Sandcrawler so the colour the sky is less saturated and closer matches the sky we see at the homestead.\n    41 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When Beru calls to Luke as they are about to inspect the droids, bushes appear &amp; disappear from shot to shot. Removed the bushes from the shots of Luke to fix this error.\n    42 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed a wire visible coming out of 3POÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s neck while Owen talks to him at the sale\n    43 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the repeated shot of R2 &amp; the red R5 unit to fix a continuity error. Replaced with a new shot.\n    44 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the pink sky effect just before this scene fades out.\n    45 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the missing glow from R2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s holo light in the garage.\n    46 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brightened &amp; desiderated the sunset scene.\n    47 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the colour problem in the shot where 3PO jumps as Luke activates the restraining bolt in the garage. In the 2004 DVDs this shot was sepia. An example of some very bad colour problems with these DVDs.\n    48 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As Luke races out of the Garage to use his macrobinoculars I have added 3PO running out of the doorway to fix an error that he suddenly appears out of nowhere.\n    49 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ New macrobinocular graphics that add in 3PO. All other macrobinocular graphics changed too.\n    50 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the droids tracks from a previous take make it look like it is being pulled along by a cord.\n    51 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When Owen shouts Luke the Treadwell droid is in a totally different place than the previous shot and a fly lands on the camera lens. Fixed both issues.\n    52 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the shot where the Tusken raiders see LukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speeder travelling through the canyon the speeder suddenly seems to speed up towards the end and looks unnatural. Recomposited the speeder to fix this.\n    53 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-coloured the sky in some shots when Ben rescues Luke so it is more blue instead of very grey/ white, which it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t in the shot where Ben scares the Tusken raiders.\n    54 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Smoothed the jump cut where Luke ignites the sabre in Obi-WanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hut\n    55 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the missing ornament on BenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s table in the shot of LeiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hologram.\n    56 -Added the missing cloak on the wall behind Luke as he ignites the sabre.\n    57 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-edited the whole ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ not only to fix the continuity errors but also because the conversation about the force and LukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father is now all together and flows better instead of being split into 2 separate conversations. It now starts off with the viewing of the hologram and fixes the continuity problems.\n    58 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added a new death Star sequence prior to the conference room scene to give the death star a better reveal. It now orbits a planet in all shots up until it is reported that it is fully operational.\n    59 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Changed the torture droids syringe arm. Removed the writings and added a laser effect.\n    60 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mos Eisley approach re-edited. Removed some of the creatures on the first shot &amp; extended the path of the landspeeder so it now fully enters the town.\n    61 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Completely removed the Ronto/ Jawa sequence.\n    62 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the probe droid hit but the worker droid.\n    63 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed both Rontos from the checkpoint scene.\n    64 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the probe droid from this scene also\n    65 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the ship that flies in front of the vaporator making it look tiny.\n    66 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When Luke looks over to the cantina it is heavily cast in shadow but as they approach there are no shadows. This has been fixed.\n    67 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added facial movements to some cantina creatures.\n    68 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the shot where you see Ponda BabbaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s severed arm I have removed the blood &amp; replaced the hand with the hoof like one we see him with in other shots.\n    69 -More facial movements &amp; blinks for Greedo\n    70 -HAN SHOOTS FIRST!! Greedo no longer shoots either.\n    71 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Removed the Jabba scene\n    72 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As they approach docking bay 94 you see R2 at the side of 3PO but as the camera pans and he goes out of shot you suddenly see him appear again from a different direction, which would be impossible for him to appear so quickly. Fixed this error\n    73 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-added the fade wipe as they approach the falcon.\n    74 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the falcons dish in the docking bay shot and expanded the docking bay.\n    75 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Slightly re-edited the docking bay shootout to fix some continuity issues\n    76 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the issues with Hans ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwobblyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ wrist as he fires\n    77 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the missing middle strut to all the Falcons cockpit window scenes.\n    78 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the blue glow back to the Falcons engines.\n    79 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As the falcon escapes Tatooine it now actually does some manoeuvres instead of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlisting lazily to the leftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n    80 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ New Alderaan for all the viewscreen shots\n    81 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ New Alderaan explosion\n    82 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-rotoscoped all lightsabres and fixed LukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s green &amp; wobbly sabre during the training session.\n    83 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Re-composited the holo chess character so they look more like holograms now.\n    84 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In close-up shots of R2 the background has the control light from the Death Star interior. These shots now have the correct background.\n    85 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fixed the jump cut as Luke turns off his sabre.\n    86 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Added the colour to the remotes laser that was missing from the 2004 DVDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\n    87 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the scene where Vader says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI told you she would neverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he gestures after he has stopped talking.

The trooper now gets hit.\n    98 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the scene where the stormtroopers are about to blast their way into the detention cell, the elevator door has visible signs that it has been rigged for to blast apart and looks a mess.

This has been fixed.\n    109 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As the Falcon leaves the docking bay it originally left very slowly even though the engines ignite and it should have accelerated faster.
