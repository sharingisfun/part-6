Here are examples of Tiffany's work in enamels, jewelry, bronze, ceramics, mosaics, paintings, and even wood, as well as his glass designs. The book traces Tiffany's search for influence as a young decorator and his later ability to shape mass taste. It discusses the cult of Nature and shows how Tiffany's forms differ from those of the European Art Nouveau movement. Tiffany's religious and secular windows, crucial in determining his status as an international glass artist, are covered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9044a7870145f798b5e3a43df5b64b7a2cdd41fd","amp;dn":"Masterworks+of+Louis+Comfort+Tiffany+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9044a7870145f798b5e3a43df5b64b7a2cdd41fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,68,167,135,1,69,247,152,181,227,164,61,245,182,75,122,44,221,65,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
