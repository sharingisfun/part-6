In following the passage of one such ship, we learn of the trials of such a journey, and the risks of manipulation and corruption of the process. What would make someone agree to such a thing? Brides is a story from a different time.\r\n\r\nNiki Douka is one such bride, one of eleven sisters of marrying age from a poor family in Samothrace, Greece. She hopes only to preserve her family's honour, protect her sister, and send home some coloured pencils for another sister. Norman Harris is an American photographer, returning home to an unhappy marriage himself. He is immediately drawn to Niki, impressed by her resolve and her quiet strength. Their developing relationship is the heart of this film, and it is beautifully handled.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 718x572, 25.000 fps, 1639 Kbps, 02h03m40s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 448 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Greek and English audio with some Italian, Russian and Turkish spoken\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles: Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, English, French, Greek\r\n                    Portuguese-Brazil, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6brz97dy9/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4dd88wdev/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ppkq6kxd3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/uzpoxvhlz/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ntxxvf8iv/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c02e431152cb957f4842779465a8ac600454a23","amp;dn":"Brides+-+Nyfes+%282004+-+Greece%29+%5BDamian+Lewis%5D+multi+subs+romance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c02e431152cb957f4842779465a8ac600454a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,2,228,49,21,44,185,87,244,132,39,121,70,90,138,198,0,69,74,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
