It is for both professional traders and undergraduates studying the basics of finance. Assuming no prior knowledge of probability, Sheldon M. Ross offers clear, simple explanations of arbitrage, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, and other topics such as utility functions, optimal portfolio selections, and the capital assets pricing model. Among the many new features of this third edition are new chapters on Brownian motion and geometric Brownian motion, stochastic order relations, and stochastic dynamic programming, along with expanded sets of exercises and references for all the chapters.\n\nFebruary 2011\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72349ae12d4a72c833b31b1e583d01d8019d7d04","amp;dn":"An+Elementary+Introduction+to+Mathematical+Finance+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72349ae12d4a72c833b31b1e583d01d8019d7d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,52,154,225,45,74,114,200,51,179,27,30,88,61,1,216,1,157,125,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
