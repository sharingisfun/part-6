For some the draw\nwas new independent books and speculative purchasing...but for others it \nwas good storytelling. Two excellent story arcs put forth by DC Comics at\nthis time were &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; and &quot;Knightfall&quot;. This collection \ncompletes the telling of the latter.\n\nThe story of &quot;Knightfall&quot; is far more than the main three chapter arc,\n&quot;Knightfall&quot;, &quot;Knightquest&quot;, and &quot;KnightsEnd.&quot; These chapters have a greater\nprologue and far reaching consequences that still ring out in current Batman\ntitles. &quot;Knightfall (The Ultimate Collection)&quot; makes an attempt to tell the \nentire, complete and chronological tale.\n\nThe story begins with the &quot;Sword of Azrael&quot;, in which Batman investigates the\nemergance of a new crusader and potential superhero. At the same time we are\nintroduced to the story arc's new villian in &quot;Vengence of Bane&quot;. \n\nCollected here for the first time, in an attempt at chronological order, is \nBruce Wayne's exhaustion in &quot;Prelude to a Fall&quot;, which leads directly into \n&quot;The Broken Bat.&quot; After the tragedy, Azrael steps into the cape and cowl \nduring &quot;Who Rules the Night&quot; which climax includes a rematch between Batman \nand Bane. &quot;Knightfall&quot; also spawned a monthly solo title, &quot;Catwoman&quot; and \nrelevant issues are included here.\n\nThus begins &quot;Knightquest&quot;. Originally, this chapter was broken into &quot;The\nSearch&quot;, a chronicle of Bruce Wayne's journey, and &quot;The Crusade&quot; which \nfollows Batman's war on crime in Gotham City. During this time, the Batman\nmade many appearances in titles like &quot;Chain Gang War&quot;, &quot;Outsiders&quot;, and DC's \nShowcase titles. &quot;Knightquest&quot; also led to the &quot;Robin&quot; monthly title, \nincluded here as well. For the first time, all titles and characters \n&quot;Knightquest&quot; touched, including Robin, Nightwing, Catwoman, the Huntress,\nand even Marvel's Punisher, are included here in as close to chronological \norder as possible.\n\nThe main story concluded in &quot;KnightsEnd&quot;. Here you will find a &quot;Catwoman&quot; \nprologue and &quot;KnightsEnd: Aftermath&quot; bookend the main storyline with a final \nwrap-up for both Azrael and Punisher.\n\nAfter the continuity shift of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, the consequences of &quot;Knightfall&quot;\nlead into the &quot;Prodigal&quot; story where Nightwing assumes the mantle of the bat\nfor a short time before Bruce Wayne returns, creating a darker Batman in \n&quot;Troika&quot;, which ties up the loose ends left by &quot;Knightquest - The Search&quot;.\n\nFor a brief time we follow Azrael and his development, turning the crusader\ninto the &quot;Agent of the Bat.&quot; Meanwhile, Bane reappears in &quot;Vengence of Bane \nII&quot;, followed by &quot;Azrael Rising&quot; in which the Azrael Batman costume shows up\nand the Demon Biis returns, tieing up loose ends left over from &quot;Sword of \nAzrael&quot;.\n\n&quot;Bane of the Demon&quot; sees Bane once more and we follow his involvement in the \n&quot;Legacy&quot; storyline which conludes with &quot;Batman: Bane&quot;. Azrael has been sent \nby Batman to track down Bane in the &quot;Angel and the Bane&quot; storyline. \n\nYears later, &quot;Knightfall&quot; echos in the &quot;Bruce Wayne: Murder?&quot; and &quot;Bruce \nWayne: Fugitive&quot; story arcs. After being framed for his girlfriend's murder,\nhe is arrested and subsequently breaks out of prison, choosing to live life\nas only the Batman. During this time, Jean Paul Valley is seen once again \nin the cape and cowl worn during &quot;Knightquest&quot;, and faces off against the\ntrue Batman. An attempt has been made to present both story arcs in a tight\nchronological order, sifting away side stories and other character prologues\nor aftermath.\n\nThe Jean Paul Valley and Azrael storylines are wrapped up with &quot;The Fall of \nAzrael&quot;. Then finally, in &quot;Bane of the Bat&quot; this massive arc, covering 230 \nissues and 24 titles reaches its conclusion.\n\nFurther reading can be done on Bane in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One year\nLater&quot; story arcs. Jean Paul Valley can be followed in all 100 issues of\n&quot;Azrael&quot;. Of course, future Azrael and Bane storylines are sure to be seen\nin the future.\n\nINCLUDED TITLES &amp; ISSUES (230)\n==============================\n\nMini-Series &amp; One-shots\n-----------------------\nNightwing: Alfred's Return\nPunisher &amp; Batman: Deadly Knights\nBatman &amp; Punisher: Lake of Fire\nBatman: Bane\nBatman: Bane of the Demon #1-4\nBatman: Sword of Azrael #1-4\nBatman: The Ten Cent Adventure #1\nBatman: Vengence of Bane\nBatman: Vengence of Bane II\n\nMonthly Titles\n--------------\nAzrael #1-7, #10-14, #36-40, #87-100\nBatgirl #24, #27-29\nBatman #484-510, #512-515, #533-534, #599-605\nBatman: Gotham Knights #25-31, #33-36, #42, #46-49\nBirds of Prey #39-41, #42\nCatwoman #1-7, #10-13, #36\nChain Gang War #6, #10-12\nDetective Comics #654-677, #679-682, #700-702, #766-772\nJustice League Task Force #4, #5-6\nLegends of the Dark Knight #59-63\nNightwing #65-69\nOutsiders #7-9\nRobin #1-9, #11-14, #32-33, #98-99\nShadow of the Bat #16-30, #32-35, #53-54\nShowcase '93 #7-12\nShowcase '94 #5-7, #10\n\nNOTE: \n=====\nthe .nfo files from the archives. \n\nthe scanner tags are in a seperate folder, so the first thing \nyou see when viewing an archive is the cover art!\n\nThough some may complain,  the additional stories from the back removed\nof later Detective Comics and Batman: Gotham Knights issues.
