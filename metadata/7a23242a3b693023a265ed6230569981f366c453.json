It was the culmination of a criminal career that author Jeff Guinn traces back to MansonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood. Guinn interviewed MansonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister and cousin, neither of whom had ever previously cooperated with an author. Childhood friends, cellmates, and even some members of the Manson Family have provided new information about MansonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Guinn has made discoveries about the night of the Tate murders, answering unresolved questions, such as why one person on the property where the murders occurred was spared. \n\nManson puts the killer in the context of his times, the turbulent late sixties, an era of race riots and street protests when authority in all its forms was under siege. Guinn shows us how Manson created and refined his message to fit the times, persuading confused young women (and a few men) that he had the solutions to their problems. At the same time he used them to pursue his long-standing musical ambitions, relocating to Los Angeles in search of a recording contract. His frustrated ambitions, combined with his bizarre race-war obsession, would have lethal consequences as he convinced his followers to commit heinous murders on successive nights. \n\nIn addition to stunning revelations about Charles Manson, the book contains family photographs never before published.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Brilliant. Written with deep insight and in seamless, fluid prose, GuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Manson expands the story of the cult leader into something far beyond the shocking story we're used to. The best book about Manson that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read . . . and I think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read them all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n(Jeffrey Deaver)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a23242a3b693023a265ed6230569981f366c453","amp;dn":"Manson+Life+%26amp%3B+Times+of+Charles+Manson+by+Jeff+Guinn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a23242a3b693023a265ed6230569981f366c453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,35,36,42,59,105,48,35,162,101,237,98,48,86,153,129,243,102,196,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
