She's not new to the police forceÃ¢â‚¬â€or to crimeÃ¢â‚¬â€but none of that matters as she's assigned to the case that could make her career. The case involves a seemingly random attack on a family in a quiet suburb of Glasgow, Scotland. Three armed men slipped from a van into a house, demanding a man who is not, and has never been, inside the front door. In the confusion that ensues, one family member is shot and another kidnapped, the assailants demanding an impossible ransom. Is this an amateur crime gone horribly wrong, or something much more unexpected? As Alex falls further into the most challenging case of her career, she must manage the complications of police force politics, and a marriage every bit as tangled as the case she's trying to solve. Rich with dark humor and powerful storytelling, STILL MIDNIGHT shows again why Denise Mina's mysteries have earned praise as among the best in the world.\n\n#2 The End of the Wasp Season\n\nWhen a notorious millionaire banker hangs himself, his death attracts no sympathy. But the legacy of a lifetime of selfishness is widespread, and the carnage most acute among those he ought to be protecting: his family. Meanwhile, in a wealthy suburb of Glasgow, a young woman is found savagely murdered. The community is stunned by what appears to be a vicious, random attack. When Detective Inspector Alex Morrow, heavily pregnant with twins, is called in to investigate, she soon discovers that a tangled web of lies lurks behind the murder. It's a web that will spiral through Alex's own home, the local community, and ultimately right back to a swinging rope, hundreds of miles away. THE END OF THE WASP SEASON is an accomplished, compelling and multi-layered novel about family's power of damage-and redemption.\n\n#3 Gods and Beasts\n\nIt's the week before Christmas when a lone robber bursts into a busy Glasgow post office carrying an AK-47. An elderly man suddenly hands his young grandson to a stranger and wordlessly helps the gunman fill bags with cash, then carries them to the door. He opens the door and bows his head; the robber fires off the AK-47, tearing the grandfather in two. DS Alex Morrow arrives on the scene and finds that the alarm system had been disabled before the robbery. Yet upon investigation, none of the employees can be linked to the gunman. And the grandfather-a life-long campaigner for social justice-is above reproach. As Morrow searches for the killer, she discovers a hidden, sinister political network. Soon it is chillingly clear: no corner of the city is safe, and her involvement will go deeper than she could ever have imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dded8338173551e3ed9769c9cc07f60ce4a2fa7","amp;dn":"Alex_Morrow_Series_1_3_by_Denise_Mina_epub-INFERNO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dded8338173551e3ed9769c9cc07f60ce4a2fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,222,216,51,129,115,85,30,62,217,118,156,156,192,127,96,206,74,47,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
