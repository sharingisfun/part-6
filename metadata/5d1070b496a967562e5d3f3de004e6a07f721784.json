In recent years Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens have produced a steady stream of best-selling books denigrating religious belief. These authors are merely the leading edge of a larger movement that includes much of the scientific community.\n\nIn response, mathematician David Berlinski, himself a secular Jew, delivers a biting defense of religious thought. The Devil?s Delusion is a brilliant, incisive, and funny book that explores the limits of science and the pretensions of those who insist it is the ultimate touchstone for understanding our world.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Berlinski holds a PhD from Princeton University and has taught mathematics and philosophy at universities in the United States and in France. He is the best-selling author of such books as A Tour of the Calculus, The Advent of the Algorithm, and Newton?s Gift. Berlinski writes frequently for Commentary, among other journals. He lives in Paris, France","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1070b496a967562e5d3f3de004e6a07f721784","amp;dn":"The+Devil%27s+Delusion+-+Atheism+and+Its+Scientific+Pretension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1070b496a967562e5d3f3de004e6a07f721784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,16,112,180,150,169,103,86,46,93,63,61,224,4,230,160,127,114,23,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
