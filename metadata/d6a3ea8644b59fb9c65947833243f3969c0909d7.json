If your program supports this you can usually do this when asked where to save the files.\nYou can let some files (or just the onces you want) be checked and download that. If the torrent is too big you can burn to DVDs or watch on computor, then delete the files from your harddrive. Open your torrentprogram again and mark the torrent. Go to torrent settings, uncheck the already downloaded files and check others for download. And so on until you have all the files you want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a3ea8644b59fb9c65947833243f3969c0909d7","amp;dn":"Eli+Stone+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a3ea8644b59fb9c65947833243f3969c0909d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,163,234,134,68,181,159,185,198,89,71,131,50,67,243,150,156,9,9,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
