The album consists of singles, B-sides and album tracks.  It includes the hit singles &quot;Whole Again&quot;, &quot;The Tide is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;, &quot;Ladies Night&quot; and &quot;It's Ok!&quot;.\n\nAmazon - It's been almost 13 years since the feisty trio launched their debut single 'Right Now' into the UK charts, and although the group may only have lasted 5 years, the music still sounds great.  It wasn't all a smooth ride though, their 4th single, Follow Me, included in this compilation in remix form, only peaked at number 20 in the UK singles chart, and the group were set to be dropped. However a timely Valentines release of a re-recorded Whole Again saved them from extinction. However another hurdle had to be crossed when a pregnant Kerry Katona quit the group, luckily former Precious member, Jenny Frost was more than capable to take the reins.  From then on, they have scored 3 UK Number 1 singles, plus a further 10, Top 10 singles and two number one albums.  This collection is a very good overview of their career, featuring singles, album tracks, B-Sides and remixes, it really covers all bases.  The fun energetic bubblegum pop of See Ya, I Want Your Love, Real Life and Dancing In The Street, sit nicely alongside more down-tempo tracks such as You Are, Last Goodbye, Believer and Cradle.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling) (Radio Mix)\n[02] See Ya (Radio Mix)\n[03] Right Now (M*A*S*H Radio Mix)\n[04] I Want Your Love\n[05] Follow Me (Solaris Radio Edit)\n[06] It's OK!\n[07] The Last Goodbye\n[08] Love Doesn't Have To Hurt\n[09] If You Come To Me\n[10] Ladies Night (Kurtis Mantronik 7&quot;)---- Featuring Kool &amp; The Gang\n[11] Someone Like Me\n[12] Cradle\n[13] Don't Go Breaking My Heart\n[14] Somebody\n[15] Locomotion\n[16] You Are\n[17] Eternal Flame\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:57m:14s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Whole Again\n[02] Right Now 2004\n[03] Something Spooky\n[04] Real Life\n[05] Holiday [Demo Version]\n[06] For Once In My Life\n[07] So Right\n[08] Feels So Good\n[09] Believer\n[10] Turn On Me\n[11] Dancing In The Street\n[12] Use Your Imagination\n[13] It's OK!
