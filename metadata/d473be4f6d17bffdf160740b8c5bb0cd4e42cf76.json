Julie Andrews plays Moore's wife, who will only tolerate so much of her husband's desperate need to reaffirm his sexual vitality, while Moore pursues Derek to a tropical rendezvous. The action builds to the now-famous bedroom scene that sent everyone rushing to the music store for their own copy of Ravel's Bolero.\n\n  Starring: Bo Derek, Dudley Moore, Julie Andrews, Robert Webber.\n\n  Rated R: Brief Nudity, Sexual Situations.\n\n  Directed by: Blake Edwards.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 2min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d473be4f6d17bffdf160740b8c5bb0cd4e42cf76","amp;dn":"10+%281979%29+%28Bo+Derek%2C+Dudley+Moore%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d473be4f6d17bffdf160740b8c5bb0cd4e42cf76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,115,190,79,109,23,191,253,241,96,116,11,140,91,176,205,78,66,207,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
