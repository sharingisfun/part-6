Review!\n\n\tA favorite of audiophiles because her music and voice lend themselves to purist recording techniques, Diana Krall perpetually sounds in great form on her recordings... The sound, remastered by Bernie Grundman, is clear, spacious and well defined -- outstanding in every way, the backing players as vivid as Kralls voice and piano.\n- Marc Mickelson/Soundstage.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRecorded live at the Paris Olympia, Live in Paris offers listeners Diana Kralls understanding of the musical techniques of composition, piano, and vocal improvisation on 12 songs from the Great American Songbooks of Cole Porter,Harold Arlen, George and Ira Gershwin, and contemporary artists Joni Mitchell and Billy Joel. Accompanied by the award-winning Anthony Wilson on guitar, John Pisano on acoustic guitar, John Clayton on bass, Jeff Hamilton on drums, and Paulinho Da Costa on percussion as well as the Orchestra Symphonies European on *Lets Fall in Love* and *I've Got You Under My Skin*, the lovely vocalist heightens your listening pleasures with distinctive phrasings and tangible pathways to inside the creative imagination by getting inside harmony, the changes, and melodic structures. On Joel's *Just the Way You Are,* Krall is accompanied by Christian McBride on bass, Michael Brecker on tenor saxophone, Lewis Nash on drums, and Wilson on guitar, among others. This song also resides on the soundtrack to the film The Guru and is probably one of the best ballads on the set due to the great solo from Brecker. His powerful but sensitive playing adds the ultimate expression and approach to the melody - one with attitudinal preparation, which is always necessary for a song that has such familiarity and association with another musician. For those who may not have heard Krall perform *live,* this recording will give you a firsthand account of the ambience and excitement of a musical evening with her.\n- Paula Edelstein/AMG\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSida A:\n\n      I Love Being Here With You (Peggy Lee, William Schluger) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n      Let's Fall in Love (Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n      Deed I Do (Walter Hirsch, Fred Rose) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n\n\nSide B:\n\n      The Look of Love (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n      East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)&quot; (Brooks Bowman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n      I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; (Cole Porter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:24\n\n\nSide C:\n\n      Devil May Care (Bob Dorough, Terrell Kirk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:52\n      Maybe You'll Be There (Rube Bloom, Sammy Gallop) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n      'S Wonderful (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n\n\nSide D:\n\n      Fly Me to the Moon (Bart Howard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:05\n      A Case of You (Joni Mitchell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:04\n      Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n      Diana Krall - piano, vocals, Fender Rhodes\n      Michael Brecker - tenor saxophone\n      Alan Broadbent - conductor\n      John Clayton - bass\n      Paulinho Da Costa - percussion\n      Jeff Hamilton - drums\n      Christian McBride - bass\n      Rob Mounsey - keyboard\n      Lewis Nash - drums\n      John Pisano - acoustic guitar\n      Luis Quintero - percussion\n      Anthony Wilson - guitar\n\n      Production\n\n      Producer: Tommy LiPuma\n      Engineer: Al Schmitt\n      Music direction: Alan Broadbent\n\n\nTechnical Log\n\nRCM Hannl limited with Rotating Brush\nMusic Hall MMF 9.1 Turntable\nTonearm: Pro-Ject 9cc evo with Pure Silver Wires\nCartridge: Nagaoka MP-500\nBrocksieper Phonomax (Tube Phono PreAmp)\nE-MU 0404 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections : Silent Wire NF5\nWavelab 5 recording software\niZotope RX Advanced 1.21 for redbook convertion\n\nVacuum cleaning - TT &gt; Belari - Laptop - Wavelab 5.01 (24/96) - manual click removal - analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) - split into individual Tracks - FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0925e2658a6366b706422766788a160628bb4f8e","amp;dn":"Diana+Krall+-+Live+in+Paris+%282002%29+%5BVinyl-180g%5D+%5BFLAC%5D-aksman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0925e2658a6366b706422766788a160628bb4f8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,37,226,101,138,99,102,183,6,66,39,102,120,138,22,6,40,187,79,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
