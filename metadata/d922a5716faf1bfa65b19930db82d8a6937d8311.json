Entering Dmitry's seemingly sci-fi world, Horizon investigates the real science inspiring his bold plan to upload the human mind to a computer.\r\nThere are doubters - like the major neuroscientist who tells us 'it's too stupid, it simply cannot be done'. But as we also meet the Japanese maker of Erica, one of the world's most human-like robots, who tells us the destiny of humans is to become robots to overcome the constraints of time, see how a quadriplegic Californian man is already controlling a robot arm with his thoughts, and explore the groundbreaking work of the scientist behind the world's largest neuroscience project - the $6 billion US Brain Initiative - who tells us the effort to map all the activity of the brain could be a crucial step towards mind uploading, Horizon asks is it really so crazy to think Dmitry Itskov could succeed in his goal of bringing about immortality for all of us within 30 years?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/The-Immortalist-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/The-Immortalist-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/The-Immortalist-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/The-Immortalist-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/The-Immortalist-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/The-Immortalist-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/The-Immortalist-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/The-Immortalist-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/The-Immortalist-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~1927Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 875 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0747199","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d922a5716faf1bfa65b19930db82d8a6937d8311","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+The+Immortalist+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d922a5716faf1bfa65b19930db82d8a6937d8311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,34,165,113,111,175,27,250,101,177,153,48,219,130,216,166,147,125,131,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
