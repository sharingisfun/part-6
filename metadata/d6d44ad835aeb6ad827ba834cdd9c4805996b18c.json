Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as Ulysses, although In Memoriam A.H.H. was written to commemorate his best friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and fellow student at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a brain haemorrhage before they could marry. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and &quot;Tithonus&quot;. During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\n\nA number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplaces of the English language, including &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw&quot;, &quot;'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all&quot;, &quot;Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die&quot;, &quot;My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure&quot;, &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;, &quot;Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers&quot;, and &quot;The old order changeth, yielding place to new&quot;. He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.\nSource: Wiki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6d44ad835aeb6ad827ba834cdd9c4805996b18c","amp;dn":"Poetry+Books+Collection%2C+Addendum+No+2+-+Lord+Alfred+Tennyson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6d44ad835aeb6ad827ba834cdd9c4805996b18c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,212,74,216,53,174,182,173,130,123,168,52,205,217,196,128,89,150,177,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
