Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second studio album, Born This Way (2011). Work continued into 2012, with the intention of releasing the record in early 2013, though an injury that Gaga sustained during her Born This Way Ball delayed its release into the later portion of the year.\n\nDescribed by Gaga as &quot;a celebration and a poetic musical journey&quot;, Artpop represents a musical departure from Born This Way. Having co-written and co-produced each of its fifteen tracks, she collaborated with producers including longtime colleagues DJ White Shadow and RedOne and newer partners including Madeon and Zedd to achieve her desired sound. Furthermore, the record features guest vocals from several new partners, including R. Kelly, T.I., Too Short and Twista.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ex4yjiZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ex4yjiZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07de5b4ef4f21a1cf97a6782a376b0c5798cf0f9","amp;dn":"Lady+Gaga+-+ARTPOP+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07de5b4ef4f21a1cf97a6782a376b0c5798cf0f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,222,91,78,244,242,26,28,249,122,103,130,163,118,176,197,121,140,240,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
