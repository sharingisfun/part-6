The most distinguished of these is DRACONIAN; a gothic/doom act which Johan established in 1994. From the profound elevation of this distinct mind calls also the spirit of DOOM:VS; a project born from the idea of constructing something utterly dark and personal in the unique field of doom metal.\n\nNear the closure of 2004 the self produced demo album, Empire of the Fallen, was released; a four track obscure and prominent contribution to the doom metal underground. The demo was very well received and led to a deal with the Finish label Firedoom Music (extreme doom metal specialist label of Firebox Records).\n\nSoon after that the debut album Aeternum Vale was recorded and finally released in 2006 and made very good reviews throughout the doom metal community.\n\nIn January 2008 the work began on yet another album. Dead Words Speak was written and recorded by Johan himself at the DRACONIAN rehearsal room. With a more heavy approach regarding the sound than previous efforts the music is both darker and more eerie than ever before. Filled with emotion and despair Dead Words Speak is a personal settlement with the past. Almost crushing sometimes the music donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lack the evocative melodies that signifies DOOM:VS.\n\nLine-up:\nJohan Ericson - Everething\nThomas Jensen - Vox\nTracklist:\n01. Earthless\n02.
