Crawford, Elena P. Ivanova (Elsevier, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nSuperhydrophobic Surfaces analyzes the fundamental concepts of superhydrophobicity and gives insight into the design of superhydrophobic surfaces. The book serves as a reference for the manufacturing of materials with superior water-repellency, self-cleaning, anti-icing and corrosion resistance. It thoroughly discusses many types of hydrophobic surfaces such as natural superhydrophobic surfaces, superhydrophobic polymers, metallic superhydrophobic surfaces, biological interfaces, and advanced/hybrid superhydrophobic surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides an adequate blend of complex engineering concepts with in-depth explanations of biological principles guiding the advancement of these technologies\r\nDescribes complex ideas in simple scientific language, avoiding overcomplicated equations and discipline-specific jargon\r\nIncludes practical information for manufacturing superhydrophobic surfaces\r\nWritten by experts with complementary skills and diverse scientific backgrounds in engineering, microbiology and surface sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090d7686da2b17de41f7fa9c967b1d9a8d2257d4","amp;dn":"Superhydrophobic+Surfaces+-+Russell+J.+Crawford%2C+Elena+P.+Ivanov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090d7686da2b17de41f7fa9c967b1d9a8d2257d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,13,118,134,218,43,23,222,65,247,250,156,150,123,29,154,141,34,87,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
