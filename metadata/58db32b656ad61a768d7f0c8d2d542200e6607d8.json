In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Chomsky found himself called upon to provide much-needed analysis and historical perspective regarding this moment in American history. In the months following 9/11, Chomsky gave dozens of talks on four continents, conducted scores of media interviews, and published a book called '9-11'-- a surprise bestseller in some of the 22 countries in which it was published.\n\nChomsky places the terrorist attacks in the context of American foreign intervention throughout the postwar decades-- in Vietnam, Central America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Beginning with the fundamental principle that any exercise of violence against civilian populations is terrorism-- regardless of whether the perpetrator is a well-organized band of Muslim extremists or the most powerful nation-state in the world-- Chomsky challenges the United States to apply the moral standards it demands of others to its own actions.\n\nPortuguese subtitle\n700 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58db32b656ad61a768d7f0c8d2d542200e6607d8","amp;dn":"Power+and+Terror+-+Noam+Chomsky+in+Our+Times+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58db32b656ad61a768d7f0c8d2d542200e6607d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,219,50,182,86,173,97,167,104,215,240,200,210,213,66,32,14,102,7,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
