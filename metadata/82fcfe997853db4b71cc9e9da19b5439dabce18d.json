It was originally\nreleased in December 1972, with a U.S. release in April 1973, and became\na commercial and critical success.\n\nThe band were well known for their strong stage act, and had privately\nrecorded several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic\nabout recording a live album until their Japanese record company decided it\nwould be good for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production\nincluding using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band\nas engineer, and were not particularly interested in the album's release\neven after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest\nand a positive response from fans.\n\nThe album was an immediate commercial success, particularly in the US, where\nit was accompanied by the top five hit, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, and became a\nsteady seller throughout the 1970s. A 3-CD set of most of the tour's shows\nwas released in 1993, while a remastered edition of the album with a CD of\nextra tracks was released in 1998. In 2014, a deluxe edition was announced\nwith further bonus material.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - Black Night [06:18]\n  02 - Speed King [07:24]\n  03 - Lucille [08:03]\n  04 - Highway Star [06:43]\n  05 - Child in Time [12:17]\n  06 - Smoke on the Water [07:36]\n  07 - The Mule (Drum Solo) [09:28]\n  08 - Strange kind of Woman [09:52]\n  09 - Lazy [10:27]\n  10 - Space Truckin' [19:54]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Deep Purple\nGenre: Hard rock / heavy metal\nAlbum Release Year: 1972 / 1998\nNumber of Tracks: 10\nTotal Duration: 1 Hour 38 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 899 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 631 MB\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82fcfe997853db4b71cc9e9da19b5439dabce18d","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+in+Japan+%5BRemastered%5D+1998+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82fcfe997853db4b71cc9e9da19b5439dabce18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,252,254,153,120,83,219,75,113,204,158,157,161,155,84,57,218,188,225,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
