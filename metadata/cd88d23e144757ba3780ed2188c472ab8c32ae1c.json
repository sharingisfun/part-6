Transcript only of Programme 3\nCoded from tape at 128/44.1\n\nProgramme 1 - Soviet Union\n\nFormer spies and intelligence analysts speak frankly about\nhow the Agency did in assessing the military strength, political\nintentions and economic power of the Soviet Union. Includes the\nastonishing and hitherto little-known story of how close the world\ncame to nuclear confrontation in the early 1980s partly because of\nthe Agency's inability to understand the extent of Soviet paranoia\nand the Reagan administration's 'evil empire' rhetoric.\n\nProgramme 2 - Iran and Vietnam\n\nOil reserves and a common border with the Soviet Union put Iran\nhigh on the CIA's list of priorities from the start of the Cold War.\nIncludes the story of how the Agency went from being the power behind\nthe Peacock Throne to outcast.\n\nAlso discusses the role the CIA played in US' Vietnam policy  in the\n1950s, 1960s and 1970s - how the Agency's lack of enthusiasm for military\naction led to it being cut out of key decisions - leading to a drift towards\ninternal crisis in the 1970s - and how the Agency reacted to being ignored.\n\nProgramme 3 - Present and Future [Transcript only]\n\nHow the CIA is tackling the new threat of al Qaeda and associated terrorist\nnetworks. Ex-Agency officials - and those called back in an effort to make up\nfor lost time - talk about the extent of the intelligence failure and '9/11'.\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd88d23e144757ba3780ed2188c472ab8c32ae1c","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+Documentary+-+%5C%27Spies+R+Us%2C+A+History+Of+The+CIA%5C%27+sp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd88d23e144757ba3780ed2188c472ab8c32ae1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,136,210,62,20,71,87,186,55,128,237,33,136,196,114,171,140,50,174,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
