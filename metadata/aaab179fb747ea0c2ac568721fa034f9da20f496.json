Dean Jagger also plays. It is directed by Raoul Walsh, who made many noirs and westerns of the more conventional variety.\n\nEdited by Christian Nyby, who later got the directing credit (probably assisted by producer Howard Hawks) for The Thing from Another World, a great classic horror flick available at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3565785/The_Thing_from_Another_World_[1951]\n\n\n*****************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can.
