Zombies of the multiverse, watch your rotting backs! To obtain a cure for the zombie virus for Morbius the Living Vampire, Aaron Stack, Agent of ARMOR, must traverse alternate realities hunting down the plague in all its myriad forms...with a most unusual (but somehow oddly appropriate) partner! First up: in the Alterniverse known as &quot;The Territory,&quot; the Old West never died. But when the greatest gunslingers of Marveldom -- Two-Gun Kid, Phantom Rider, Kid Colt, and many others -- rise from their graves in Boot Hill, the stage is set for a High Noon showdown with flesh-eating outlaws the likes of which you've never seen! \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4af59a97dc536b9fe202f5772eb5f0a42357fbc","amp;dn":"Marvel+Zombies+5+%2801+-+05%29+%282010%29+%28digital%29+%28Minutemen-InnerDemo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4af59a97dc536b9fe202f5772eb5f0a42357fbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,175,89,169,125,197,54,185,254,32,47,87,114,235,95,10,66,53,127,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
