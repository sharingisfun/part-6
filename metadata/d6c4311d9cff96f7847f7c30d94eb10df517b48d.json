It is the most comprehensive book in the field. It is required reading for MPA students, Ph.D. students, and all scholars in the field.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Kenneth J. Meier, Charles H. Gregory Chair in Liberal Arts, Texas A&amp;M University\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is the bible for public management scholarship. It is the first place to turn when looking for an accessible but rigorous analysis of research on basic aspects of organizational life in the public sector, such as how culture, leadership, and motivation matter. The interdisciplinary array of research on public management has become so voluminous as to seem overwhelming at times. RaineyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary curatorial prowess allows him to turn these fragments of work into a coherent and insightful body of knowledge. Anyone interested in how research can inform governance should start with this book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Donald Moynihan, professor of public affairs, Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs, University of WisconsinÃ¢â‚¬â€Madison\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is the Encyclopedia Britannica of public management; if you want to find out what has been written, and what is collectively said about the practice and theory of public management, look no further than RaineyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s updated and comprehensive fifth edition.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Richard M. Walker, chair professor of public management and associate dean, City University of Hong Kong\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For more than a decade, RaineyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book has been a must-read for everyone in the community of public management in Korea, just like in many places all over the world. Undoubtedly, it provides a valuable resource for researchers and students who are interested in public management and applications of organization theory to public organizations. It is quite simply the best investigation of public organization and management that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Young Han Chun, associate dean, Graduate School of Public Administration, Seoul National University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c4311d9cff96f7847f7c30d94eb10df517b48d","amp;dn":"Understanding+and+Managing+Public+Organizations%2C+5E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c4311d9cff96f7847f7c30d94eb10df517b48d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,196,49,29,156,255,150,247,132,127,124,48,217,78,177,13,245,23,180,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
