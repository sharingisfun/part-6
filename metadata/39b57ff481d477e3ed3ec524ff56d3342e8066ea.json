With several hundred diagrams, and far fewer prerequisites than usual, this is the first visual intuitive introduction to complex analysis. Although designed for use by undergraduates in mathematics and science, the novelty of the approach will also interest professional mathematicians.  \n\n\nReadership: Primarily undergraduates in mathematics, but also undergraduates in physics and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b57ff481d477e3ed3ec524ff56d3342e8066ea","amp;dn":"Visual+Complex+Analysis+-+Tristan+Needham+-+Pdf+DjVu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b57ff481d477e3ed3ec524ff56d3342e8066ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,181,127,244,129,212,119,227,237,62,197,36,255,86,211,52,46,128,102,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
