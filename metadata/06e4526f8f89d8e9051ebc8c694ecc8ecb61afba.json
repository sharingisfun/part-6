Lao Tzu's statements of the Tao Te Ching came into being only at the end of his life. Mystics usually don't write books; they speak and work directly with people in a transformational way. In the same way, Osho's books are transcriptions of his daily talks.\n\nThis book is a rare exception: 100 letters written by Osho and mailed to a disciple, Yoga Sohan, in connection with events during a meditation camp in which she participated. Osho promised her that he would send her a letter every dayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and that she should keep them so they could be published one day. \n\nThis unique selection of these letters contains Osho's very personal instructions and insights on a meditative life. In one he says, &quot;ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what meditation is all about Ã¢â‚¬â€œ writing love letters to life.&quot;\n\nIf you have come to the point where you feel there must be something more to life and are ready to explore other dimensions of being, this collection will provide an essential road map. The one hundred short passages in this book are full of diverse and pertinent gems. They will touch your heart and inspire you, showing you how to turn each and every moment of your life into a celebration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e4526f8f89d8e9051ebc8c694ecc8ecb61afba","amp;dn":"Life+Is+a+Soap+Bubble-+Osho+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+PDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e4526f8f89d8e9051ebc8c694ecc8ecb61afba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,228,82,111,143,137,216,233,5,30,188,140,105,78,204,142,203,97,175,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
