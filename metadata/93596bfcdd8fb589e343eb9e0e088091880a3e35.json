What are we? Where are we going? In a generational work of clarity and passion, one of our greatest living scientists directly addresses these three fundamental questions of religion, philosophy, and science while Ã¢â‚¬Å“overturning the famous theory that evolution naturally encourages creatures to put family firstÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Discover magazine). Refashioning the story of human evolution in a work that is certain to generate headlines, Wilson draws on his remarkable knowledge of biology and social behavior to show that group selection, not kin selection, is the primary driving force of human evolution. He proves that history makes no sense without prehistory, and prehistory makes no sense without biology. Demonstrating that the sources of morality, religion, and the creative arts are fundamentally biological in nature, Wilson presents us with the clearest explanation ever produced as to the origin of the human condition and why it resulted in our domination of the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biosphere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93596bfcdd8fb589e343eb9e0e088091880a3e35","amp;dn":"The+Social+Conquest+of+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93596bfcdd8fb589e343eb9e0e088091880a3e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,89,107,252,221,143,181,137,227,67,235,158,14,8,128,145,136,10,62,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
