In December 2012, controversy hit the book once again when Gail Simone was abruptdly fired from writing the title via email from new Batgirl Editor Brian Cunningham. In her place, writer Ray Fawkes was slated to write two issues as a fill in writer, before a new permanent writer could be assigned. Surprisingly, after considerable fan outrage at the seemingly out of nowhere firing of Simone, DC placed her back on the title nearly two weeks after she was dismissed, set to return on the 19th issue.\n\nWritten by: Gail Simone (#1 - 16; 19 - Present); Ray Fawkes (#17 - 18)\n\nIllustrated by: Ardian Syaf (#1 - 12); Vicente Cifuentes (#5); Alitha Martinez (#7-8); Ed Benes (#0, #13 - 14); Daniel Sampere (#14 - Present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18fb054ffb91964519d79af723bf112dfc64d340","amp;dn":"Batgirl+%28000+-+034+%2B+Annuals%29+%282011+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18fb054ffb91964519d79af723bf112dfc64d340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,251,5,79,251,145,150,69,25,215,154,247,35,191,17,45,252,100,211,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
