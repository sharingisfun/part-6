The debut EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Devil ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Blues Pills is packed full of soulful goodness and proves that classic rock still exists and when done well can still move people. This American-Swedish-French quartet will no doubt garner major world attention and success in the years to come and I for one am glad I got on this train early.\n\nInfluences like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Cream and Janis Joplin without doubt make up a lot of this bands DNA, nevertheless this group is firmly stamping itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own fresh twist and vision on a style of rock that is rarely seen in current circles. The EP opens with the title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Devil ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and you are hooked from the first listen. The tone and power of Elin LarssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals must be heard (you tube clip below). ElinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intro is met with a dirty blend of blues riffs and soloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that compliment each other and show a maturity of a band well beyond their young years. Dorian Sorriaux at just 18 years of age plays guitar like he was born in a different generation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows off his poise justly as they bring it down for a more somber yet equally moving track. Some of the driving bass lines of Zack Anderson are on show in the fittingly titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time is NowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as things are sped up the vocals take a backseat to some polished guitar work and incredible soloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. The closer is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dig InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Elin takes centre stage again and the tempo is eased as we are taken away into the world of Blues Pills . ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a extremely high standard for a debut EP and does exactly what a EP release should do. It gives you a taste and has you demanding more.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very easy to be cynical about statements like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Next Big ThingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ so we will steer away from that and just say this is a amazing EP. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great to hear sounds like this still being produced and given a real chance of success. With any luck these guys will be on radio station near us all soon. They truly are a throwback from a bygone era of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest luminaries.
