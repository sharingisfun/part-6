HDR Efex Pro enables a wide variety of options, including single-click visual style presets, as well as global adjustments such as exposure, contrast, structure to fine detail contrast, and a new HDR Method option. \n\nThis feature makes use of four tone-mapping algorithms, which enable virtually unlimited HDR ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlooksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that can be adapted to a particular HDR style of photography.\nNik SoftwareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proprietary U PointÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology is also incorporated into HDR Efex Pro, providing precise selective fine-tuning of images without the need for complicated selections or layer masks. \n\nPhotographers can precisely control selective adjustments with a single mouse-click providing the ability to quickly create amazing results. Finishing adjustments, such as vignette controls and levels &amp; curves, make it possible to easily accomplish a range of enhancements within HDR Efex Pro.\n\nHDR Efex Pro also enables photographers to create popular and dramatic HDR images from a single exposure. This feature allows photographers to reprocess a single image in which an exposure series was not previously shot or for subject matter that does not lend itself to multiple exposures.\n\nKey Features\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Intuitive interface, with easy to understand photographic terminology and the actual processed results always displayed\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ U Point powered selective tools for fast, precise enhancements of contrast, shadow, structure, saturation adjustments, and more\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiple proprietary tone mapping algorithms enabling a wide range of HDR styles\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Visual presets that produce amazing results in a single-click\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ability to create the HDR look from a single exposure\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Advanced technology for automatic image alignment and reduction of subject motion artifacts known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œghostsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ All-in-one 32-bit color workflow enabling the creation of professional HDR images\n\nHOME: http://www.niksoftware.com/\n\n\nCONFIG : \n\nMacÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® OS 10.5 through 10.6\nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® processor\n2 GB of RAM (4GB recommended)\nAdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® CS3 through CS5, Adobe Photoshop LightroomÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2.6 through 3.0 (32-bit and 64-bit compatible) or later or AppleÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ApertureÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2.1.4 through 3.0 or later (32-bit and 64-bit compatible)\nAdobe Photoshop CS3 through CS5; Extended Edition required for 32-bit per channel Smart Object support\n\n\nHow to instal : \n\n1./ install program \n\n2./ start it from Photoshop or lightroom .   \n\nAt registration request use registration by phone, insert the installation ID into the XFORCE keygen and generate serial and activation.  \n\n\nCopy and paste serial and activation code\n\n3./ That's it, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£NJ0Y\n\n    ______)          _____                        ______         \n   (, /  /)         (, /   ) ,                   (, /    )       \n     /  (/    _      _/__ /    __  _  _/_  _       /---(  _      \n  ) /   / )__(/_     /     _(_/ (_(_(_(___(/_   ) / ____)(_(_(_/_\n (_/              ) /                          (_/ (        .-/  ( DeGun 2011\n                 (_/                                       (_/   \t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206e9a0004156c0693e1999e6f350117ac90c9a0","amp;dn":"Nik+HDR+Efex+Pro+1.200+incl.+K-Gun+-+Degun+TPB2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206e9a0004156c0693e1999e6f350117ac90c9a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,110,154,0,4,21,108,6,147,225,153,158,111,53,1,23,172,144,201,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
