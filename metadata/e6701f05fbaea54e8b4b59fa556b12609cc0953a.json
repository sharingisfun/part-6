Over 200 musicians contribute, including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, 4 choirs, a Maori mens chorus, percussionists Greg Ellis and the On Ensemble, as well as an international cast of featured soloists. The Soweto Gospel Choir performs a rendition of Tin\\\\\\'s masterwork \\\\\\'Baba Yetu\\\\\\', a song widely known as the theme to the video game Civilization IV. Mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade sings the lovely Polish \\\\\\'Hymn Do Trojcy Swietej\\\\\\', medieval superstars Anonymous 4 perform the Irish \\\\\\'Caoineadh\\\\\\', and Portuguese fado sensation Dulce Pontes performs \\\\\\'Se ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â° Pra Vir Que Venha.\\\\\\' Iranian vocalist Sussan Deyhim is featured on the lively \\\\\\'Hamsafar\\\\\\', and Japanese pop star Lia (sharing the spotlight with Aoi Tada and Kaori Omura) sings about the passing of the seasons in \\\\\\'Mado Kara Mieru\\\\\\'. Composed of 12 songs in 12 different languages, the song-cycle is structured in three broad movements: day, night and dawn--corresponding to life, death and rebirth. The lyrics come from sources as diverse as religious texts like the Torah and Bhagavad Gita, to ancient Persian and Japanese poetry, to lyrics by contemporary writers. The message of the album is that we are interconnected as a people; and despite our differences in culture, religion and belief, we all share the same common human experiences. As much as the album is a musical travelogue, it\\\\\\'s also a survey of many of the great world vocal traditions, including: African call-and-response, opera, medieval chant, Irish keening, Arabic and Indian Carnatic improvisation, and many more. All these styles are seamlessly woven together through Tin\\\\\\'s lush, Romantic orchestrations. The album was recorded at London\\\\\\'s famous Abbey Road Studios, and engineered by three-time Grammy winner John Kurlander, known for his work on the Lord Of The Rings movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6701f05fbaea54e8b4b59fa556b12609cc0953a","amp;dn":"Christopher+Tin+-+Calling+All+Dawns+%5Bmp3%40320+bps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6701f05fbaea54e8b4b59fa556b12609cc0953a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,112,31,5,251,174,165,78,139,75,89,250,85,107,18,96,156,192,149,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
