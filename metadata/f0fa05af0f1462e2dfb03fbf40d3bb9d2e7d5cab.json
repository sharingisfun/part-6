No installation requred, as it runs direct from CD / image.\nHowever, i had problems using this on my machines which already had Adobe reader 8 or later installed.\nWhen i tried it on a machine that didnt have adobe reader installed, i got past that hurdle.\n\nNext, it wouldnt run as it complained about an expired licence. As per the instructions that came with the manual, i had to set my PC Clock back to year 2003. It then ran okay.\n\nIts a pain ... but i find the information contained in the manual extremely helpful .. and therefore, find it a small price to pay, to switch the year to 2003 and back again when using the manual.\n\nYou must use daemon tools or equivalent to mount the image, or burn it to CD.\n\nENJOY !!\n\nKEEP THE TORRENT SPIRIT ALIVE - Please seed to a ratio of at least 2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fa05af0f1462e2dfb03fbf40d3bb9d2e7d5cab","amp;dn":"Rover+25+45+75+Tourer+-+MG+ZR+ZT+ZTT+ZS+MG+TF+-+Handbook+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fa05af0f1462e2dfb03fbf40d3bb9d2e7d5cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,250,5,175,15,20,98,226,223,176,63,191,64,211,187,157,46,125,92,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
