But math plays a part in all of our lives all of the time, whether we know it or not. In The Joy of x, Steven Strogatz expands on his hit New York Times series to explain the big ideas of math gently and clearly, with wit, insight, and brilliant illustrations.\n\nWhether he is illuminating how often you should flip your mattress to get the maximum lifespan from it, explaining just how Google searches the internet, or determining how many people you should date before settling down, Strogatz shows how math connects to every aspect of life. Discussing pop culture, medicine, law, philosophy, art, and business, Strogatz is the math teacher you wish youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had. Whether you aced integral calculus or arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure what an integer is, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find profound wisdom and persistent delight in The Joy of x.\n\n\n\nCheck me upload.
