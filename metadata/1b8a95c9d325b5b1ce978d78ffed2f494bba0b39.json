Tags; Celtic, Ireland, Humor, Travel\n\nDespite the many exotic places Pete McCarthy has visited, he finds that nowhere else can match the particular magic of Ireland, his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homeland. In McCarthy's Bar, his journey begins in Cork and continues along the west coast to Donegal in the north. Traveling through spectacular landscapes, but at all times obeying the rule, Ã¢â‚¬Å“never pass a bar that has your name on it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he encounters McCarthyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bars up and down the land, meeting fascinating people before pleading to be let out at four oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock in the morning. Written by someone who is at once an insider and an outsider, McCarthy's Bar  is a wonderfully funny and affectionate portrait of a rapidly changing country.\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[McCarthy] is a worthy addition to the ranks of P. J. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Rourke, Bill Bryson, and Peter Mayle.... He narrates a series of hilarious and surprising adventures with an acerbic eye and a comedianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift for timing.... This wonderful debut will appeal to readers who are looking for a well-observed travel guide, or simply for its incisive hilarity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8a95c9d325b5b1ce978d78ffed2f494bba0b39","amp;dn":"McCarthy%27s+Bar%3A+Journey+in+Ireland-Pete+McCarthy+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8a95c9d325b5b1ce978d78ffed2f494bba0b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,138,149,201,211,37,181,177,206,151,141,120,255,237,47,73,75,186,11,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
