Seeking to continue her education, Percy has come to Queen Victoriaâ€™s London, to the Athens Academy. What she will learn there will change her life forever.\r\nAthens Academy is the citadel of The Guard, an ancient order that battles the forces of evil. The Victorian Guard, led by professor Alexi Rychman, is incomplete. They cannot defeat Jack the Ripperâ€” who is more than the serial killer he appears to beâ€”or the greater monster his appearance heralds.\r\nPercyâ€™s lifelong habit of concealment combined with Alexiâ€™s fevered search for the Guardâ€™s missing seventh nearly prove disastrous as ancient Greek myths begin playing out in modern, gaslit, Victorian London. Percy and her new friends and allies must overcome their preconceptions about each other and their own histories before they can set the world to rights.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03b70a16609d4acc9e939a31c2ae1c91e1df926","amp;dn":"Strangely+Beautiful+-+Leanna+Renee+Hieber+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03b70a16609d4acc9e939a31c2ae1c91e1df926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,59,112,161,102,9,212,172,201,233,57,163,28,42,225,201,30,29,249,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
