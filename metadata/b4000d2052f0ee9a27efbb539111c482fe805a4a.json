But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic? And if the tools of our democracy are not working to solve the rising crises we face, how can weÃ¢â‚¬â€average citizensÃ¢â‚¬â€make change happen?\n\nDavid Graeber, one of the most influential scholars and activists of his generation, takes readers on a journey through the idea of democracy, provocatively reorienting our understanding of pivotal historical moments, and extracts their lessons for todayÃ¢â‚¬â€from the birth of Athenian democracy and the founding of the United States of America to the global revolutions of the twentieth century and the rise of a new generation of activists. Underlying it all is a bracing argument that in the face of increasingly concentrated wealth and power in this country, a reenergized, reconceived democracyÃ¢â‚¬â€one based on consensus, equality, and broad participationÃ¢â‚¬â€can yet provide us with the just, free, and fair society we want.\n\nThe Democracy Project tells the story of the resilience of the democratic spirit and the adaptability of the democratic idea. It offers a fresh take on vital history and an impassioned argument that radical democracy is, more than ever, our best hope.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4000d2052f0ee9a27efbb539111c482fe805a4a","amp;dn":"David+Graeber+-+The+Democracy+Project%3A+A+History%2C+A+Crisis%2C+A+Mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4000d2052f0ee9a27efbb539111c482fe805a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,0,13,32,82,240,238,154,39,239,187,83,145,17,196,130,254,128,90,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
