Daniel Auteuil portrays Jean-Marc Faure, who, like Romand, had fooled his friends, family, and the bank for 18 years. Though those who knew Faure believed he was a physician employed by the World Health Organization in Geneva, he actually had no qualifications for the position, and had never held a real job. As part of the faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade, Faure commuted to Switzerland daily, and obviously knew his way around the WHO. However, he had no job to perform there. Though he acquired an enormous overdraft at the bank, they believed he was a well-known doctor, and incorrectly assumed he would repay them shortly. Nearly two decades after his original untruth, Faure is nearly found out. Rather than enduring the shame of his long-time fraud, Faure opts to murder his wife, children, and parents. -- Tracie Cooper\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53cfac2e1931cbeaf3649f0c99530c19f874bdb8","amp;dn":"L%5C%27Adversaire+aka+The+Adversary+%282002%29+-+Nicole+Garcia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53cfac2e1931cbeaf3649f0c99530c19f874bdb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,207,172,46,25,49,203,234,243,100,159,12,153,83,12,25,248,116,189,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
