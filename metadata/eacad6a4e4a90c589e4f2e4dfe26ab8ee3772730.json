Why early retirement decreases life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights. Five reasons why organizations predict death, including one health insurance company. \n\nA truly omnipresent science, predictive analytics affects everyone, every day. Although largely unseen, it drives millions of decisions, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. Predictive analytics transcends human perception. \n\nThis book's final chapter answers the riddle: What often happens to you that cannot be witnessed, and that you can't even be sure has happened afterward -- but that can be predicted in advance? \n\nWhether you are a consumer of it -- or consumed by it -- get a handle on the power of Predictive Analytics. This book is easily understood by all readers. Rather than a &quot;how to&quot; for hands-on techies, the book entices lay-readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest state-of-the-art \ntechniques.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nProduct page &amp; author: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eacad6a4e4a90c589e4f2e4dfe26ab8ee3772730","amp;dn":"Predictive+Analytics%3A+The+Power+-+Eric+Siegel+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eacad6a4e4a90c589e4f2e4dfe26ab8ee3772730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,202,214,164,228,169,12,88,158,79,46,77,254,38,171,142,227,119,39,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
