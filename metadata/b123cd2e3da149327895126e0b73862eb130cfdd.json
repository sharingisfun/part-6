Signed to Sony at the age of 15, Goodrem rose to prominence in 2002, starring in the popular Australian soap Neighbours as Nina Tucker, and this assisted her establishing an international music career.

She currently holds the record for the highest selling album of the last decade and the most #1 singles from any debut album, with all five of her singles from her debut album Innocent Eyes reaching #1 on the ARIA charts.

Her music is influenced by vast array of styles including Classical, Adult Contemporary music, Pop and Soft Rock. She is currently the face of Sunsilk and So Good in Australia. Her debut album, 2003's Innocent Eyes, gave her the highest selling Australian album of the last decade, in the process making her one of Australia's highest selling female recording artists of all time.
