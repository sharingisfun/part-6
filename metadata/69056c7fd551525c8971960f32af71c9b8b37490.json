W. Pabst (PandoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Box) in this classic adaptation of the Weimar-era theatrical sensation. Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, The Threepenny Opera follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (a.k.a. Mack the Knife) as he tries to woo Polly Peachum and elude the authorities. With its palpable evocation of corruption and dread, set to WeillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irresistible score, The Threepenny Opera remains a benchmark of early sound cinema. It is presented here in both its celebrated German and rare French versions.\n\nBonus Stuff: \n* Criterion Collection Booklet Insert (PDF)\n* Criterion Collection Full Cover Scan\n* Original German poster from Berlin - 1928","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69056c7fd551525c8971960f32af71c9b8b37490","amp;dn":"3+penny+Opera%2C+The+-+Disc+1+-+The+Film+%281931%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Cri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69056c7fd551525c8971960f32af71c9b8b37490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,5,108,127,213,81,82,92,137,113,150,15,50,175,113,201,184,179,116,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
