It's a new wave album, a reggae album, a dance album, a punk album, and a rap album. Rock-solid songwriting and Debbie Harry's sultry vocals hold the CD together despite the stylistic reaches of the tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5368a4127b02a7e14a0e16bb42fc9a0957ecca9b","amp;dn":"Blondie+-+The+Best+Of+Blondie+%28FLAC-EAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5368a4127b02a7e14a0e16bb42fc9a0957ecca9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,104,164,18,123,2,167,225,74,14,22,187,66,252,154,9,87,236,202,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
