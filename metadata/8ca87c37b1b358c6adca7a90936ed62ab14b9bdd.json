He is a multiple Grammy-, Dove-, Stellar- award winner and nominee as a performer and a producer.\n\nHammond first gained recognition while playing bass guitar for the gospel group The Winans. By 1985 he was one of the six original members of the group Commissioned, participating in 10 of the group's 12 albums.\n\nAfter his stint with Commissioned ended, he regained fame in the gospel community after selling millions of albums with his musical group Radical For Christ.\n\nIn 2002 Hammond returned to the group Commissioned (now with members Keith Staten, Marvin Sapp, Mitchell Jones, Karl Reid, Michael Williams, and Marcus Cole) to produce the Commissioned Reunion Live album.\n\nHammond produced Make Me Like The Moon, a stirring gospel ballad co-written by Chante Moore and Kenny Lattimore for their 2006 double-CD of gospel and R&amp;B love songs entitled Uncovered/Covered (released October 10, 2006 by LaFace/Verity/Zomba Music Group).
