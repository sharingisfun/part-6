In a way, the categorization made sense. Compared to the heavy metal and art rock that dominated mid-'70s guitar rock, the Heartbreakers' bracing return to roots was nearly as unexpected as the crashing chords of the Clash. As time progressed, it became clear that the band didn't break from tradition like their punk contemporaries. Instead, they celebrated it, culling the best parts of the British Invasion, American garage rock, and Dylanesque singer/songwriters to create a distinctively American hybrid that recalled the past without being indebted to it.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Jefferson Jericho Blues\n02.Saving Grace\n03.Mary Jane's Last Dance\n04.Learning To Fly\n05.Free Fallin'\n06.It's Good To Be King\n07.The Last DJ\n08.Flirting With Time\n09.Into The Great Wide Open\n10.Runnin' Down A Dream\n11.Something In The Air\n12.All Or Nothin'\n13.I Won't Back Down\n14.Waiting For Tonight\n15.You Wreck Me.mp3\n16.Makin' Some Noise\n17.Yer So Bad\n18.Out In The Cold\n19.I Should Have Known It\n20.Room At The Top\n21.Breakdown\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Kings Highway\n02.A Higher Place\n03.Big Weekend\n04.Good Enough\n05.You And Me\n06.Free Girl Now\n07.Night Driver\n08.Two Gunslingers\n09.I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\n10.Walls (Circus)\n11.You Don't Know How It Feels\n12.Love Is A Long Road\n13.So You Want To Be A Rock 'N' Roll Star\n14.Jammin' Me\n15.I Need To Know\n16.Refugee\n17.The Waiting\n18.Listen To Her Heart\n19.Don't Do Me Like That\n20.You Got Lucky\n21.Don't Come Around Here No More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a116de337fbab187c88dec96fdc55ff564d3849","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a116de337fbab187c88dec96fdc55ff564d3849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,17,109,227,55,251,171,24,124,136,222,201,111,220,85,255,86,77,56,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
