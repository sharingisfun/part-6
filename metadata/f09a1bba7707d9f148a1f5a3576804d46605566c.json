Do whatever it takes to survive - without destroying your souls, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the game is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\r\n\r\nExperience war from a completely new angle: play as civilians trying to survive\r\nForge emotional bonds with your characters\r\nInspired by real events\r\n\r\nThis War of Mine: The Little Ones (v2.3.0.7)\r\n\r\nGenre: Action - Adventure - Survival\r\nWorks on: Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Mac OS X (10.7.0+) and Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04)\r\nLanguages: Text only: PortuguÃªs do Brasil, ä¸­æ–‡, Deutsch, English, espaÃ±ol, franÃ§ais, italiano, æ—¥æœ¬èªž, í•œêµ­ì–´, polski, Ñ€ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹, TÃ¼rkÃ§e\r\nFeatures: single-player - achievements\r\nReleased: June 1, 2016\r\nSize: 11 MB\r\nCompany: 11 bit studios / 11 bit studios\r\nIncluded goodies: wallpaper\r\n\r\nAbout: \r\nThis War of Mine: The Little Ones explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective; that of a child.\r\n\r\nBased on This War of Mine, The Little Ones puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in the middle of hell, trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger. The question is: how far will you go to make it through another day?\r\n\r\nThis War of Mine: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also the fact that even in times of conflict, kids are still kids - they laugh, cry, play with toys and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to bring back the kid in yourself to understand how to protect the little ones. Their faith, and their futures, are in your hands.\r\n\r\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle.
