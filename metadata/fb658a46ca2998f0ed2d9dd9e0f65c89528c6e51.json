After second album Super Tight..., UGK hit the R&amp;B charts with 1996's Ridin' Dirty, which ascended to the number two spot. Dirty Money followed in late 2001. Pimp C began serving at three-year jail sentence in early 2002, putting UGK on ice until 2007, when the double album Underground Kingz appeared. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Swisha And Dosha\n02.Int'l Players Anthem (I Choose You) (Feat.
