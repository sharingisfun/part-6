The appellation &quot;cool&quot; has been ascribed to Baker because of his often understated, contemplative approach to jazz, but on THE BEST OF CHET BAKER PLAYS we hear a trumpeter who defies any such categorization.\n\nJust as Miles Davis' BIRTH OF THE COOL is canted more towards bebop than the atmospheric, textural and reflective attributes so often associated with cool jazz, ...CHET BAKER PLAYS is more about tightly arranged, uptempo burning than midtempo cool. Of course, Baker's introspective ballad playing is also featured on tracks such as &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot; and &quot;Darn that Dream.&quot; Overall, however, what makes Baker's conception so unique in his early years, is the light, yet crisp, feel he and his band mates employ. Whether playing bebop or cool, his approach is consistent and, most of all, innovative. In short, THE BEST OF CHET BAKER PLAYS shows Baker's adaptability as well as his versatility.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Carson City Stage 2:35\n2 Imagination 3:00\n3 All The Things You Are 2:53\n4 Bea's Flat 2:58\n5 Happy Little Sunbeam 2:40\n6 Pro Defunctus 3:26\n7 Moonlight Becomes You 3:24\n8 Stella By Starlight 3:53\n9 Darn That Dream 3:28\n10 Sweet Lorraine 3:08\n11 Minor Yours 7:12\n12 C.T.A. 5:09\n13 To Mickey's Memory 5:12\n14 Jumpin' Off A Clef 4:55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607de5dc7f9b1825e463d52a8e353c9fb72a0a47","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+The+Best+Of+Chet+Baker+Plays+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607de5dc7f9b1825e463d52a8e353c9fb72a0a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,125,229,220,127,155,24,37,228,99,213,42,142,53,60,159,183,42,10,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
