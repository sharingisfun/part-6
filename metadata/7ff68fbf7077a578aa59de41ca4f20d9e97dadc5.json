After its glory days in the Roman Empire, it stood in the path of Muslim expansion, suffered betrayal by crusading Catholics, was seized by the Russian tsars and faced near-extinction under communism. MacCulloch visits a collection of icons in the Sinai desert, a relic of the iconoclastic crisis in Istanbul and Ivan the Terrible's cathedral in Moscow.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3150 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.45GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged (except episode 1)\nSource: DVB-S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff68fbf7077a578aa59de41ca4f20d9e97dadc5","amp;dn":"BBC+A+History+of+Christianity+3of6+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff68fbf7077a578aa59de41ca4f20d9e97dadc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,246,143,191,112,119,165,120,170,89,222,65,202,79,32,217,233,125,173,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
