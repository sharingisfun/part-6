Boyle makes his Ecco debut with a powerful, gripping novel that explores the roots of violence and anti-authoritarianism inherent in the American character.\n\nSet in contemporary Northern California, The Harder They Come explores the volatile connections between three damaged peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€an aging ex-Marine and Vietnam veteran, his psychologically unstable son, and the son's paranoid, much older loverÃ¢â‚¬â€as they careen towards an explosive confrontation.\n\nOn a vacation cruise to Central America with his wife, seventy-year-old Sten Stensen unflinchingly kills a gun-wielding robber menacing a busload of senior tourists. The reluctant hero is relieved to return home to Fort Bragg, California, after the ordealÃ¢â‚¬â€only to find that his delusional son, Adam, has spiraled out of control.\n\nAdam has become involved with Sara Hovarty Jennings, a hardened member of the Sovereign CitizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Movement, right-wing anarchists who refuse to acknowledge the laws and regulations of the state, considering them to be false and non-applicable. AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s senior by some fifteen years, Sara becomes his protector and inamorata. As Adam's mental state fractures, he becomes increasingly schizophrenicÃ¢â‚¬â€a breakdown that leads him to shoot two people in separate instances. On the run, he takes to the woods, spurring the biggest manhunt in California history.\n\nAs he explores a fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy of violence and his powerlessness in relating to his equally violent son, T. C. Boyle offers unparalleled psychological insights into the American psyche. Inspired by a true story, The Harder They Come is a devastating and indelible novel from a modern master","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bbee86d77481a24949af928b12ef2f3c3e3689","amp;dn":"The+Harder+They+Come+-+T.C.Boyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bbee86d77481a24949af928b12ef2f3c3e3689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,187,238,134,215,116,129,162,73,73,175,146,139,18,239,47,60,62,54,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
