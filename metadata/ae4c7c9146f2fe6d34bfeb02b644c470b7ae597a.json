Sorry for the crappy cover it is not true black in color. Big Papi usually scans his own and learned his lesson.\n\n- Big Papi\n\nBy finulanu\nFirst off, let me say that I am somewhat obsessed with Radiohead - they're my favorite band other than the Beatles, and easily the best group currently making music. So when I first learned of a Radiohead compilation, I almost flew into a &quot;Pacifist's rampage&quot;. That is, I almost threw assorted harmless objects such as cloth napkins and pillowcases within a five-inch radius in an otherwise empty room. But then I calmed myself down, and realized that this is a great intro to a fantastic band. See, the thing about Radiohead is that a compilation actually works for them. Their albums (particularly the Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and In Rainbows, though they have yet to disappoint me) are all very good, or at least have very good moments, and they've never made a bad one. But their best songs make perfect sense out of album context (other than &quot;Treefingers&quot;, a brief instrumental that serves no purpose other than to link the first and second halves of the album). So they're not like Pink Floyd, whose albums you have to hear entirely in order to get where they're going. Nor are they the Beatles (the greatest band ever, by the way) who have too many hits, famous songs, and whatnot, to fit on four CD's.\n\nSo, basically, the casual Radiohead fan should just go for it. It contains all of Radiohead's most significant hits not found on In Rainbows, after all - &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;Just&quot;, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, &quot;No Surprises&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;There There&quot; and so forth; and a few album tracks, too! I have to give them the thumbs-up for including &quot;The Bends&quot;, which rocks like hell, and the apocalyptic techno &quot;Idioteque&quot;, a fan favorite.\n\nI don't know what else to say, really. If you're new to Radiohead, and just want all the hits on one disc, scoop it up. But be warned: this group can be addicting.\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nRadiohead - The Best of Radiohead\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Radiohead\nAlbum................: The Best of Radiohead\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2008 06 03\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 66 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 268kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.3\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
