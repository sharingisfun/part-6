Set in Paris, Gigi is about a girl (Leslie Caron) on a lower rung of society who blossoms into Cinderellahood before our eyes and ears. Thank heaven for Hermione Gingold and Maurice Chevalier as her mentors, and Louis Jourdan as her prince. The screenplay writer and lyricist Lerner always said that Gigi's title song was his favorite of all he'd written. The winner of nine Academy Awards (plus a special Oscar for Chevalier), including Best Picture, Gigi was the last great MGM movie musical and one of the best.\n\n  Starring: Leslie Caron, Maurice Chevalier, Louis Jourdan, Hermione Gingold, Eva Gabor.\n\n  Directed by: Vincente Minnelli.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 55min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d077a4e75bbbad07a3844b305c9c61802d8646","amp;dn":"Gigi+%281958%29+%28Leslie+Caron%2C+Maurice+Chevalier%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d077a4e75bbbad07a3844b305c9c61802d8646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,208,119,164,231,91,187,173,7,163,132,75,48,92,156,97,128,45,134,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
