Entries on the objects follow, arranged by broad periods or themes (Tudor Renaissance, Sporting Life, the Highlands, etc.). Many of the objects are outstanding, but without any unifying theme this collection appears to be more successful as an exhibit than as a book with something overall to say. The color illustrations are very good, but the tone of the entries varies from author to author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b84cb2e6dfc8465c528c795dc2bf08212fee8a65","amp;dn":"The+Treasure+houses+of+Britain+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b84cb2e6dfc8465c528c795dc2bf08212fee8a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,76,178,230,223,200,70,92,82,140,121,93,194,191,8,33,47,238,138,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
