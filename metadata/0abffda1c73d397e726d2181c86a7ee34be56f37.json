Buckminster Fuller - DVD\n\nBuckminster Fuller was an architect, engineer, geometrician, philosopher, futurist, inventor of the famous geodesic dome, and one of the most brilliant thinkers of his time. His legacy becomes ever more relevant, providing us a road map to steer our planet away from oblivion and toward a sustainable future for all humanity.\n\nThis film by Oscar-winning filmmaker Robert Snyder, like his other documentaries on &quot;the greats&quot; (Michelangelo, Henry Miller, Willem de Kooning, Pablo Casals, among others), transports the viewer into Fuller's mind and soul. Told entirely in his own words, the film is an intimate, personal and inspiring message from Fuller to our fragile world.\n\n85 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abffda1c73d397e726d2181c86a7ee34be56f37","amp;dn":"The+World+of+Buckminster+Fuller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abffda1c73d397e726d2181c86a7ee34be56f37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,191,253,161,199,61,57,126,114,109,33,129,200,106,126,227,75,229,111,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
