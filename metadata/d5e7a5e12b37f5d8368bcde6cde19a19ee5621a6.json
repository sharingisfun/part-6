Topics covered include modeling, analysis, design, packaging, and thermal and fabrication considerations.\n\nThrough a unique integration of theory and practice, readers will learn to solve amplifier-related design problems ranging from matching networks to biasing and stability. More than 240 problems are included to help readers test their basic amplifier and circuit design skills-and more than half of the problems feature fully worked-out solutions.\n\nWith an emphasis on theory, design, and everyday applications, this book is geared toward students, teachers, scientists, and practicing engineers who are interested in broadening their knowledge of RF and microwave transistor amplifier circuit design.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/69/04703916/0470391669.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/69/04703916/0470391669.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout author :-\n\nInder J. Bahl, PhD, has been working on microwave and millimeter wave GaAs ICs for more than twenty-five years. He is responsible for the design of over 400 MMICs, including low-noise amplifiers, driver amplifiers, broadband amplifiers, power amplifiers (high-power, high-efficiency, and broadband), dc and ac coupled transimpedance and limiting amplifiers, multi-bit phase shifters, narrow and broadband SPDT switches, redundant switches, programmable attenuators, balanced mixers, quadrature downconverters, upconverters, transmit chips, receive chips and transmit/receive chips. Dr. Bahl has also developed modules consisting of MMICs for PAR and ECM applications.\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e7a5e12b37f5d8368bcde6cde19a19ee5621a6","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+RF+and+Microwave+Transistor+Amplifiers+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e7a5e12b37f5d8368bcde6cde19a19ee5621a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,231,165,225,43,55,245,216,54,139,205,230,205,225,154,25,238,86,33,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
