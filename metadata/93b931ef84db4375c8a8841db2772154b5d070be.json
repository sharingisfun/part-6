Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature.\n\nLabeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic.\n\nWritten by William Golding \nRead by Martin Jarvis \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 128 Kbps \nUnabridged \nMass Market Paperback: 208 pages\nPublisher: Perigee Books; Reissue edition (July 27, 1959)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0399501487\nISBN-13: 978-0399501487\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
