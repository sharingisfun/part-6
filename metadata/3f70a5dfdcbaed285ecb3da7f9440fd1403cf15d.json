This course will teach you how to do it well.  You will learn some simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and some common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning.  We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f70a5dfdcbaed285ecb3da7f9440fd1403cf15d","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Think+Again+-+How+to+Reason+and+Argue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f70a5dfdcbaed285ecb3da7f9440fd1403cf15d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,112,165,223,220,186,237,40,94,203,61,167,249,68,15,209,64,60,241,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
