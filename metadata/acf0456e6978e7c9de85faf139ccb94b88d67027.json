Vol. III of Kierkegaard's Writings, edited and translated, with introduction and notes, by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong. Princeton University Press, 1987.\n\nISBN 9780691073156 | 728 pages | PDF\n\nSÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard, the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher rediscovered in the twentieth century, is a major influence in contemporary philosophy, religion, and literature. He regarded Either/Or as the beginning of his authorship, although he had published two earlier works on Hans Christian Andersen and irony. The pseudonymous volumes of Either/Or are the writings of a young man (I) and of Judge William (II). The ironical young man's papers include a collection of sardonic aphorisms; essays on Mozart, modern drama, and boredom; and &quot;The Seducer's Diary.&quot; The seeming miscellany is a reflective presentation of aspects of the &quot;either,&quot; the esthetic view of life.\n\nPart II is an older friend's &quot;or&quot;, the ethical life of integrated, authentic personhood, elaborated in discussions of personal becoming and of marriage. The resolution of the &quot;either/or&quot; is left to the reader, for there is no Part III until the appearance of Stages on Life's Way. The poetic-reflective creations of a master stylist and imaginative impersonator, the two men write in distinctive ways appropriate to their respective positions.\n\nKierkegaard's Writings is a definitive, systematically translated, scholarly edition of SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard's works in English, comprising twenty-five volumes of text and a separate cumulative index. Each volume includes a historical introduction, selections from Kierkegaard's journals and provisional manuscripts, notes and an index.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;The definitive edition of the Writings. The first volume . . . indicates the scholarly value of the entire series: an introduction setting the work in the context of Kierkegaard's development; a remarkably clear translation; and concluding sections of intelligent notes.&quot; -- Library Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf0456e6978e7c9de85faf139ccb94b88d67027","amp;dn":"Kierkegaard%3A+Either%2FOr%2C+Part+1+%28Princeton%2C+1987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf0456e6978e7c9de85faf139ccb94b88d67027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,240,69,110,105,120,231,201,222,133,250,241,57,204,185,75,136,214,112,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
