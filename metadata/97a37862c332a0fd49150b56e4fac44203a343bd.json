Twenty-five years and nineteen albums on, they are still going strong, although the only original member remaining is singer Henk Hofstede. Their career is paved with little treasures, like 1987 In The Dutch Mountains, their magnificent live album, Urk, released a year later, or thecrystal sciseled beauty Ting in 1992.\n\nWool is their latest album.\n\nenjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a37862c332a0fd49150b56e4fac44203a343bd","amp;dn":"The+Nits+-+Urk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a37862c332a0fd49150b56e4fac44203a343bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,163,120,98,195,50,160,253,73,21,11,86,228,250,196,66,3,163,67,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
