Depending on the race, players can either follow an obvious course or find their own routes, using quick instincts and knowledge of the city's side streets, alleyways, shortcuts and ramps. Like the first in the series, the open design provides players with intelligent choices to make, instead of fixed rails in which to proceed. Career mode starts players off in a city and enables them to freely choose an opponent by flashing their lights, communicating the desire to drag. The game supports two-player split-screen racing and online play for up to eight.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
