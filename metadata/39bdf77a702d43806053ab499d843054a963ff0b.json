A close listen to lyrics like &quot;I Can't Make It Anymore&quot; and &quot;Morning, Morning&quot; reveals sadness and loneliness, yet the music is so appealingly positive that a listener actually comes away feeling uplifted. In fact, on most of the songs on this album, it's the sound of Havens' distinctive voice coupled with his unusual open-E guitar tuning, rather than the specific lyrical content of the songs, that pulls the listener in. The six-and-a-half minute &quot;Follow&quot; is structured like a Dylan composition in the &quot;Hard Rain&quot; mode, with its memorable verse-ending refrain, &quot;Don't mind me 'cause I ain't nothin' but a dream.&quot; Both &quot;Sandy&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot; have a jazzy feel, while the aforementioned &quot;I Can't Make It Anymore&quot; would not have been out of place in a movie soundtrack or pop radio playlist of the time. &quot;Handsome Johnny,&quot; one of Havens' best known songs as a result of the Woodstock film, is a classic anti-war ballad, stoked by the singer's unmistakable thumb-chorded guitar strumming. Mixed Bag winds up with a soulful cover of Dylan's &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; and an electric piano-propelled take on the Lennon-McCartney classic, &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39bdf77a702d43806053ab499d843054a963ff0b","amp;dn":"Richie+Havens+-+Mixed+Bag+%5B1967%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39bdf77a702d43806053ab499d843054a963ff0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,189,247,122,112,45,67,128,96,83,171,73,157,132,48,84,169,99,255,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
