It was a night of pot, pills and popcorn with \r\nthe popcorn coming in a close third to the other two. But overall, the Led \r\nZeppelin concert at the Kingdome came off without too much trouble. There \r\nwere several arrests, lots of dope and booze smuggled in â€“ either under \r\ncoats or inside bodies â€“ and some very sick kids from drinking too much. \r\nâ€œIt's not a bad bunch considering the number of people hereâ€, one Seattle \r\npolice officer said of the 62,000 people, â€œand considering the reputation \r\nof the group.â€ Led Zeppelin has earned a reputation for attracting surly \r\ncrowds which generally fight and riot. But the most damage was to the ears \r\nand there is a possibility 62,000 people will spend today saying, â€œHuh?â€ \r\nWhat attracted these people, generally hard-core rock fans, was the \r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIt was appreciated by some when the lead singer, Robert Plant, told the \r\ncrowd he was deaf in one ear. It was a miracle the whole band wasnâ€™t stone \r\ndeaf. Later, Plant said his hearing came back during one number. The \r\nconcert started shortly after 8 p.m. amid fireworks and people holding up \r\nlighted matches, the moment everybody had been waiting for. Throughout the \r\nlong Sunday, the huge crowd remained orderly as it waited to get through \r\nthe gates and have the experience. At 4:30 yesterday afternoon, the 20,000 \r\nor so Zeppelin fans waiting at the Kingdome started to chant, â€œWe want in, \r\nwe want in.â€ Suddenly a movement rippled through the crowd like a wave \r\npushing the front-line troops into the fence. Plant promised that the 1977 \r\ntour would be â€œblood, thunder and the hammer of the godsâ€. A squad of \r\nparamedics was geared up for the blood and everybody else was geared up for \r\nthe thunder and hammer part. \r\n-Post-Intellengencer (July 1977)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f299e12c475f8554ba40f256c7771aa74e7b1e","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Year+Of+The+Dragon+1977.07.17+Region+Free+DVD9+++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f299e12c475f8554ba40f256c7771aa74e7b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,242,153,225,44,71,95,133,84,186,64,242,86,199,119,26,167,78,123,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
