It is simply written in a manner that answers a vast array of questions on why cats do exactly what they do. Remember, these incredible creatures are trying to figure out what you are all about, too! \n\nThe coloured photographs are exceptional and ones you will be sure to treasure for years to come. What does a cat signal with its eyes? How many &quot;tail-signals&quot; does this wonderful feline actually have? Why does a cat drink dirty water? Can cats predict earthquakes? Why does your cat roll over when it sees you and why does it sometimes sulk? \n\nThese and approximately seventy-six other questions are explained in this delightful hard-covered book. If you are a cat lover, &quot;Catwatching&quot; is a definite must for your library and it makes a great conversation piece on your coffee table.\n\n- Sandra D.
