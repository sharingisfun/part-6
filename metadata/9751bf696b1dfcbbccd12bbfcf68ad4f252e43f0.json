The song quickly became the anthem of Liverpool Football Club. The words &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; also feature in the club crest and on the Shankly Gate entrance to Anfield, the home stadium.\n\nPink Floyd took a recording by the Liverpool Kop choir, and &quot;interpolated&quot; it into their own song, &quot;Fearless&quot;, on their 1971 album Meddle.\n\n\nVarious Artists\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Never Walk Alone (Versions)\n\n2015\n\nfeat.
