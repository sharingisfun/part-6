With its revamped TrueVelocity engine and OpenCL support, it makes editing and rendering a bit speedier than before. Plus, it's got built-in 3D support.\n\nAs for the basics, PowerDirector can import and handle most of the video file types you would normally come across. You can also use it to easily add text, effects, and transitions; edit audio; capture video; burn discs; and share content online. Plus, it has intuitive, icon-based navigation and ample thumbnails, making it quite easy to zip around its interface. \n\nSo what's new? Eye-popping titles, picture-in-picture, particle effects, and time-lapse editing are among the added features. There's also, of course, some incredibly powerful 3D editing, as it can import all types of 3D content, convert from 2D to 3D, and output to virtually any industry-standard 3D format. Plus, the program includes some very nifty 3D menus and effects.\n\nAmong the new features, one of our favorites has to be Audio Beat Marker, which can potentially shave hours off of your editing sessions. The Beat Marker analyzes your soundtrack and automatically places markers at what it feels are major beat points, making it much easier to precisely place music-driven transitions and other effects. So, as you can imagine, it makes editing, say, a music video a less tedious process. There's also a single-click audio normalizer for when you're compiling several clips from different audio sources with different audio properties.\n\nAnother new feature we enjoy is the Drawing tool. It can record your mouse-drawn gestures and create overlays for use with your footage. Imagine recording your signature, and having it play out to look like graffiti being sprayed on a wall. While it might not be something you'd use every day, it sure is a nifty trick to have in your back pocket. \n\nFinally, one thing that sets PowerDirector apart from its competitors is its integrated user community, DirectorZone. Through DirectorZone, you can download creative new menus, effects, particles, and even tutorials to help enrich your CyberLink experience overall. So if you need to stylize some dream sequence footage, for instance, you can log in and get tips from others who have that kind of knowledge.\n\nWhile we do love the improvements that PowerDirector 10 brings to the table, we still wish we could squeeze a bit more out of its revamped engines. We felt it was a bit sluggish when launching, and it even lagged a little when we tried to quickly click through and preview all of the video effects. Overall, it's certainly not a slow program, but we did expect it to be a bit zippier.\n\nIn spite of its performance blips, we still consider CyberLink PowerDirector 10 a feature-packed video editor that gives you tons of bang for your buck. Whether you're a novice video editor or a more advanced user, it should have the tools you're looking for. And if it doesn't, you can probably find what you're looking for in the built-in treasure trove that is DirectorZone.\n\nfrom Cyberlink now :\n\nWith a revamped TrueVelocity rendering engine that's faster than ever, along with the richest end-to-end 3D editing suite available, PowerDirector 10 is redefining digital video editing.

Already the fastest editor on the market, the latest version of PowerDirector introduces rendering engine innovations that take video processing speeds to new heights.\n\nTo the range of TrueVelocity technologies that improve previewing, effects rendering, format conversions, and outputting of videos, PowerDirector 10 has added OpenCL support, an enhanced HD video encoder and a patented Intelligent SVRT technology to help users to produce better videos in less time.\n\nOpenCL Support for Optimum Hardware Acceleration\n\n OpenCL is the latest technology aimed at utilizing the full potential of system GPU and CPU power. Added into PowerDirector's new TrueVelocity 2 rendering engine, OpenCL harnesses the power of your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and applies it to 48 video effects, greatly improving the speed of the editing process. \n\n \n \nIntelligent Video Rendering with SVRT\n\nComplex calculations done for you! Intelligent Smart Video Rendering Technology (SVRT) analyzes an entire project to assess the types of media and formats used, then selects the best output profile for optimal production speed. \n\nOnce the output profile is chosen, your video is rendered in the shortest possible time using patented1 SVRT technology that recognizes the portions of a movie clip that have been modified and only renders those portions during production and not the entire clip. \n\n New Generation H.264 Encoding\n\nThanks to an enhanced H.264 software encoder, PowerDirector 10 is up to 38% faster than PowerDirector 9 at rendering 1080 HD video clips. This means that even if your PC doesn't have the latest CPU/GPU hardware, rapid video rendering speeds are still within reach.\n\nPowerDirector 10\nThe World's Fastest Video Editor\nPurchase Options\nPowerDirector 10\n  \tUltra \nincl.
