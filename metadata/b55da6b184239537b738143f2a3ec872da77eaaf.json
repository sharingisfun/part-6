Operating between the lines of the Constitution this powerful and unelected group fights to save the nation from &quot;terror&quot; and weapons of mass destruction while at the same time modifying and undermining the very essence of the country. Many books are written about secrecy, surveillance, and government law-breaking; none so powerfully expose the truth of everyday life in this state of war.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nWilliam Arkin is one of America's premier military experts, having served in Army intelligence in West Berlin during the Cold War. Since then, he has written more than a dozen books, briefed hundreds of top military, intelligence and government officials, and been a part of countless exposÃƒÂ©s. Working for the Washington Post, he conceived and co-authored the landmark &quot;Top Secret America&quot; investigation, and co-wrote the national bestseller of the same name with colleague Dana Priest. He lives in Vermont.\n\n\nHardcover: 368 pages\nPublisher: Little, Brown and Company (September 10, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0316251240\nISBN-13: 978-0316251242\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: america, american, usa, united states, politics, government, usg, constitution, war, peace, peace studies, terror, terrorism, civic, history, surveillance, nsa, snowden, privacy, bill, rights, supreme, court, justice, law\nlegality, constant, war, iron, triangle, dystopia, dystopian, NCTC, liberty, freedom, cross, DHS, TSA, FBI, IA, DOD, military, pentagon, usaf, usa,usmc,usn, represenative, speech, policy, arrest, detain, homegrown, extremist, hate, shtf, prepare, communist, socialist, democratic, republic, libertarian, obama, bush, clinton, reagan, carter, nixon, lbj, jfk, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b55da6b184239537b738143f2a3ec872da77eaaf","amp;dn":"American+Coup%3A+How+a+Terrified+Government+Is+Destroying+the+Cons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b55da6b184239537b738143f2a3ec872da77eaaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,93,166,177,132,35,149,55,183,56,20,63,42,62,200,114,218,119,234,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
