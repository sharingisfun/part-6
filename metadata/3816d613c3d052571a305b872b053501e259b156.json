With over 100,000 users worldwide, and over a million realized projects, ArchiCAD is a tried, tested and proven solution for architects who design and build &quot;Great Buildings&quot;.\n\nWhile workflow is centred on ArchiCAD, other applications may also contribute to the creation as well as the analysis of the Virtual Building data. Because of ArchiCAD's open architecture and support of IFC standards, ArchiCAD can be easily connected with, and used in conjunction with, a variety of other applications. As a result, with ArchiCAD-based architectural solutions, every part of the architectural workflow can be sufficiently covered with the widest usage of the Virtual Building's data","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3816d613c3d052571a305b872b053501e259b156","amp;dn":"ArchiCAD+12+Portable+%28Eng%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3816d613c3d052571a305b872b053501e259b156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,22,214,19,195,208,82,87,26,48,91,135,43,5,53,1,226,89,177,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
