Load your double-barreled crossbow with Chippunks, Boombats, and other &quot;live&quot; ammo\nBased in the unique Oddworld universe that brings to life the most bizarre creations\nOverview:\nYou're the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation. However the nature of your illness remains a secret and as you find out during the game, for a good reason.\n\nThis world is full of bad guys so there is plenty to do. Each opponent is different, sometimes in the most bizarre way so you have to be careful and adapt your tactics to each target individually. So load up your double-barreled crossbow with up to 81 living ammo combinations. Track down those criminals with money on their head and bring them in, dead or alive. Welcome to the Mongo River Valley, the irony mining capital of the continent.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e2562b395da1d13eceb95804b60d7a70f69e5f2","amp;dn":"Oddworld+-+Stranger%27s+Wrath+HD+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e2562b395da1d13eceb95804b60d7a70f69e5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,37,98,179,149,218,29,19,236,235,149,128,75,96,215,167,15,105,229,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
