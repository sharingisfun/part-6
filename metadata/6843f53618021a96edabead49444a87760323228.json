His first cookbook offers 75 recipes for sizzling T-bone and rib-eye steaks, mouthwatering burgers, slow-cooked barbecue ribs, and more. Working with chef Cristobal Vazquez, Nolan presents a fresh take on the Tex-Mex standards of his childhood. The book includes family recipes for Sunday roasts and brisket, savory side dishes, and a few favorite desserts as well, including Ruth Ryan's Special Occasion Carrot Cake. In the accompanying texts Nolan shares his love of the food of the Southwest and the lessons he's learned in a remarkable career in baseball and in cattle ranching.\n\n\nBy Nolan Ryan\nPublished by Little Brown Book Group in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 180 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6843f53618021a96edabead49444a87760323228","amp;dn":"The+Nolan+Ryan+Beef+and+Barbecue+Cookbook%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6843f53618021a96edabead49444a87760323228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,67,245,54,24,2,26,150,237,171,234,212,148,68,168,119,96,50,50,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
