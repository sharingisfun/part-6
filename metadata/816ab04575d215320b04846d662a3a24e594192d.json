How does an inanimate universe generate stunning new forms and unbelievable new powers without a creator? How does the cosmos create?\n\n ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the central question of this book, which finds clues in strange places. Why A does not equal A. Why one plus one does not equal two. How the Greeks used kickballs to reinvent the universe. And the reason that Polish-born Benoit MandelbrotÃ¢â‚¬â€the father of fractal geometryÃ¢â‚¬â€rebelled against his uncle.\n\n YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take a scientific expedition into the secret heart of a cosmos youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen. Not just any cosmos. An electrifyingly inventive cosmos. An obsessive-compulsive cosmos. A driven, ambitious cosmos. A cosmos of colossal shocks. A cosmos of screaming, stunning surprise. A cosmos that breaks five of scienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sacred laws. Yes, five. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be rewarded with author Howard BloomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s provocative new theory of the beginning, middle, and end of the universeÃ¢â‚¬â€the Bloom toroidal model, also known as the big bagel theoryÃ¢â‚¬â€which explains two of the biggest mysteries in physics: dark energy and why, if antimatter and matter are created in equal amounts, there is so little antimatter in this universe.\n\n Called &quot;truly awesome&quot; by Nobel PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinner Dudley Herschbach, The God Problem will pull you in with the irresistible attraction of a black hole and spit you out again enlightened with the force of a big bang. Be prepared to have your mind blown.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816ab04575d215320b04846d662a3a24e594192d","amp;dn":"The+God+Problem%3A+How+a+Godless+Cosmos+Creates+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816ab04575d215320b04846d662a3a24e594192d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,106,176,69,117,210,21,50,11,4,132,109,102,42,58,36,229,148,25,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
