Who else would send all-staff emails to smoke out the dumbest people on her show? Now, in this new collection of original essays, the #1 bestselling author of Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea delivers one laugh-out-loud moment after another as she sets her sights on the ridiculous side of childhood, adulthood, and daughterhood. \n\nFamily moments are fair game, whether it's writing a report on Reaganomics to earn a Cabbage Patch doll, or teaching her father social graces by ordering him to stay indoors. It's open season on her love life, from playing a prank on her boyfriend (using a ravioli, a fake autopsy, and the Santa Monica pier) to adopting a dog so she can snuggle with someone who doesn't talk. And everyone better duck for cover when her beach vacation turns into matchmaking gone wild. Outrageously funny and deliciously wicked, CHELSEA CHELSEA BANG BANG is good good good good! \n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing; Unabridged edition (March 4, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1478925647\nISBN-13: 978-1478925644","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1351ddbd81d9de9bbc9f14989388bec93dffaf","amp;dn":"Chelsea+Chelsea+Bang+Bang+2014+by+Chelsea+Handler+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1351ddbd81d9de9bbc9f14989388bec93dffaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,19,81,221,189,129,217,222,155,188,159,20,152,147,136,190,201,61,255,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
