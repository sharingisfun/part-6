All you need to do to use it is unpack the file named startupcrashfix.zip in your game folder.\nAn alternative solution may be to disable your onboard graphics (untested). \n\n2. Intel onboard graphics new-game-crash-fix:\nCopy the sea_modified.dll located in the main game folder to MODULES and rename it to sea.dll.\n\nYou can change your resolution to full HD (1920x1080) in the file &quot;engine.ini&quot;.\n\n\n1. Mount or unpack .iso\n2. Install\n3. Play\n\nIf you found a better solution than swiftshader for the startup crash-to-desktop, kindly leave a comment with a link.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f361b595a292649e80cc840c1f7e0e2ae5ab306","amp;dn":"Pirates.Of.The.Caribbean.2003.REPACK-vol1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f361b595a292649e80cc840c1f7e0e2ae5ab306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,54,27,89,90,41,38,73,232,12,200,64,193,247,224,226,174,90,179,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
