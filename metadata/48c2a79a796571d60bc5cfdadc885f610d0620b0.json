Starting with an empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to create a proper cell block. You'll need to hire some guards, get some showers built and unless the kitchen is up and running with chefs working away you're going to end up with a riot on your hands. From there you take your prison in which-ever direction you like. A monsterous super-max or comfortable center for rehabilitation, the choice is up to you.\n\nAlpha 26a changelog (30.10.2014): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/builds.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/builds.html&lt;/a&gt;\n- 0002141: [Save &amp; Load] Can overwrite save files without warning (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0005441: [Gameplay] object_FoodWaste is not being removed properly (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0006001: [Other] Name in Game ages incorrect (lim_ak) - resolved.\n- 0006021: [Control &amp; User Interface] too many informants cover the screen (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0005611: [Control &amp; User Interface] Clone toolbar not visible (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0006069: [Gameplay] Supermax security prisoners are downgraded back to Max security after a murder (lim_ak) - resolved.\n- 0006493: [AI &amp; Behaviour] prisoners use the same seat/phone/shower etc (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0001589: [Control &amp; User Interface] Request - digital clock (elDiablo) - resolved.\n- 0004535: [Control &amp; User Interface] Enumerate cells by security level (elDiablo) - resolved.\n- 0003822: [Gameplay] Always Fog Of War (Chris) - resolved.\n- 0004464: [Gameplay] Cooks and reform programs clash with the new regime system (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0004193: [AI &amp; Behaviour] (Some) Prisoners won't attend Reform Programs (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0003542: [Graphics] Full-screen image flash when contraband discovered (elDiablo) - resolved.\n- 0004588: [AI &amp; Behaviour] Multiple regimes not working with classroom scheduling (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0004515: [Sound] Riot Music Continues to Play After Loading a Different Prison (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0005846: [Save &amp; Load] Special char in user account name result in the game failing to save (John) - resolved.\n- 0001358: [AI &amp; Behaviour] Dead inmate's family still come for visitation (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0004720: [AI &amp; Behaviour] Teacher wanders into adjacent rooms while teaching (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0003948: [Control &amp; User Interface] dragging sound may continue playing when it shouldn't (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0003162: [Sound] Construction sound would not stop (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0004048: [Sound] carpenter table sound continues even when no one is working at it (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0002093: [Sound] Sirens do not turn off (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0006208: [Sound] Ringing sound when deploying guard for patrols (Icepick) - resolved.\n- 0000450: [Other] Make the introduction video skippable (elDiablo) - resolved.\n- 0004419: [AI &amp; Behaviour] Having Multiple Psychiatrists running Multiple Counseling Programs causes them to jump between.
