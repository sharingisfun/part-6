It contains a collection of papers in which results achieved in the collaboration of scientists from computer science, mathematics, physics, and mechanical engineering are presented. From the science problems to the mathematical algorithms and on to the effective implementation of these algorithms on massively parallel and cluster computers we present state-of-the-art methods and technology as well as exemplary results in these fields. This book shows that problems which seem superficially distinct become intimately connected on a computational level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16242d5cc6ed8b2b3cd50f92563698414d597a06","amp;dn":"Parallel+Algorithms+and+Cluster+Computing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16242d5cc6ed8b2b3cd50f92563698414d597a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,36,45,92,198,237,139,43,60,213,15,146,86,54,152,65,77,89,122,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
