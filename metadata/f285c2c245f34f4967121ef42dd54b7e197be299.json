One look at the title My Secret Public Journal Live and a Birbiglia fan might correctly guess that this album is based off his blog of the same name. This means there's a lot of storytelling and wandering topics, all delivered at a much slower pace than his normal set. The transitions aren't that smooth, &quot;Catholic School Sunglasses&quot; isn't very good at all, and the stories are padded by bits of material that have appeared on earlier efforts, but there's a slow charm to hearing the comedian in this looser atmosphere and a couple moments that are prime Birbiglia. &quot;Porno for Parents&quot; is a hilarious story of the older generation and their befuddlement with computers while &quot;Roger Clemens Hates Me&quot; is a great tale of a comedian in an incredibly uncomfortable position. Uncomfortable positions are Birbiglia's bread and butter, as the epic opener &quot;Celebrity Golf&quot; also displays, but some of these uneasy feelings aren't ones a normal person -- as in non-celebrity -- would ever experience and at times this really feels like a journal in every self-indulgent sense of the word. My Secret Public Journal Live is a good album for the serious Birbiglia addict, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nTracks\n \t \t \t \t\n1       Celebrity Golf\t\t        14:31\n2\tJoe Bags\t\t        2:11\n3\tLandfill Pretzels\t\t4:26\n4\tOrange Asian Tigers\t\t3:30\n5\tLike Fun!\t\t        2:10\n6\tCatholic School Sunglasses\t3:30\n7\tThe Old Mill Pond Story\t\t4:02\n8\tPorno for Parents\t\t2:56\n9\tJack &amp; Irma's Magic Phones\t2:26\n10\tSleepy Karl\t\t        2:59\n11\tYou Can't Shoot the Shooter\t3:40\n12\tPachoo!\t\t                1:11\n13\tRoger Clemens Hates Me\t\t6:38\n14\tPut It on Paper\t\t        4:09\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f285c2c245f34f4967121ef42dd54b7e197be299","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Mike+Birbiglia+-+My+Secret+Public+Journal+Live+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f285c2c245f34f4967121ef42dd54b7e197be299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,133,194,194,69,243,79,73,103,18,30,244,45,213,75,126,25,123,226,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
