Brunius\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nChronicles a love affair over a single summer afternoon in 1860, along the banks of the Seine. The film is based on a short story by Guy de Maupassant, who was a friend of Renoir&amp;#039;s father Auguste Renoir. Future star directors Jacques Becker and Luchino Visconti worked as Renoir&amp;#039;s assistant directors.\n\nPartie de campagne was shot in July, soon after France had elected the Popular Front government, and employers had negotiated the Matignon agreement, providing wage increases, 40-hour weeks, trade union rights, paid holidays and improved social services. The film was not released until 1946, ten years after it was shot. Renoir never finished the filming due to weather problems, but the producer, Pierre Brauenberger, turned the material into a release after World War II.\n\nDuration: 0:38:38\n\nDimensions: 448 x 336\n\nVideo Codec: Xvid\n\nAudio Codec: MP3, VBR\n\nOn Screen English Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a32d87a06a6896801e4aef834cf5c4dae9c120","amp;dn":"A+Day+in+the+Country+%7BPartie+de+Campagne%7D+%5BJean+Renoir%5D+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a32d87a06a6896801e4aef834cf5c4dae9c120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,163,45,135,160,106,104,150,128,30,74,239,131,76,245,196,218,233,193,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
