Scoring her first national hit in 1987 with &quot;Mademoiselle Chante le Blues,&quot; Kaas was named Female Newcomer of the Year at the Victoires de la Musique, and her debut album Mademoiselle Chante earned platinum status in France, Belgium and Switzerland; the follow-up, Scene de Vie, topped the French charts for three months. She then spent the better part of the early '90s touring the globe, becoming the first Western-born female performer to play in Hanoi since the end of the conflict in Vietnam; Je te dis vous followed in 1993, and the following year Kaas issued her first live effort, Tour de charme. Upon completing 1997's Phil Ramone-produced Dans Ma Chair, Kaas headlined a series of dates at Paris' Olympia Theatre which yielded the live Rendez-vous; her debut for Sony Classical, Christmas in Vienna, appeared in 1999. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Kaas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Kaas&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Kaas_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Kaas_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMp3  320kb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385032deaf9888c07c6719b1de92a63f331db17e","amp;dn":"Discografia+-+Patricia+Kaas+-+1990-2005++%28With+Covers%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385032deaf9888c07c6719b1de92a63f331db17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,80,50,222,175,152,136,192,124,103,25,177,222,146,166,63,51,29,177,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
