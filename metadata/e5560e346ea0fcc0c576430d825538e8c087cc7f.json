Developing leadership skills and leaders is critical in order to optimise the use of resources, their application, service planning and delivery of services for patients and their families.\n\nThis is the first book on leadership (rather than management skills) to focus on psychiatry and mental health care. Contributions from international experts with clinical and non-clinical backgrounds pull together the theories and practical skills required to be a successful leader. The aim is to guide mental health professionals in general and psychiatrists in particular on how to gain the relevant skills and on how to utilise these skills and training to take on leadership roles in clinical and organisational settings.\n\nThe book covers the role of the leader and the skills required for leadership, including chapters on communication, decision-making, team development, mentoring, gender issues in leadership, burnout and more. It includes a section on assessment tools and learning material. Essential reading for all those who aspire to lead in psychiatry!\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 277 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (October 28, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1119952913\nISBN-13: 978-1119952916\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5560e346ea0fcc0c576430d825538e8c087cc7f","amp;dn":"Leadership+in+Psychiatry+%282013%29+by+Dinesh+Bhugra+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5560e346ea0fcc0c576430d825538e8c087cc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,86,14,52,110,160,252,192,197,118,67,13,130,85,56,232,192,135,204,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
