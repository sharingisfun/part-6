It featured\ngame reviews, news and technical articles. The latter increased \nsignificantly as the Amiga market shrank. EMAP gave the magazine a \ndignified send-off in the last issue, and CU remains one of the more\ninfluential magazines of the era.\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on\npublic Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad. The OCR software has increased the file\nsize slightly, and some of the early issues haven't OCR'd as well as the\nlater ones, due to the layout and fonts used.\n\nMore OCR'd mags will be periodically available - please check\nfor more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their\ncontinued support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
