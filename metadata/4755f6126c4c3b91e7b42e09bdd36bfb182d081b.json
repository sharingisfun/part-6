Aliofkhazraei, A.S.H. Makhlouf (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThis edited book is devoted to different electrochemical aspects of nano materials. This comprehensive reference text is basically divided in 3 parts: electrochemical synthesis routes for nanosized materials, electrochemical properties of nano materials and electrochemical characterization methods for nanostructures. The Handbook is a reference work to chemists and materials scientists interested in the nano aspects of electrochemistry. The chapters are written by a number of international experts in the field and the content will assist members of both electrochemical and materials communities to keep abreast of developments in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4755f6126c4c3b91e7b42e09bdd36bfb182d081b","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Nanoelectrochemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4755f6126c4c3b91e7b42e09bdd36bfb182d081b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,85,246,18,108,76,59,145,231,180,46,9,189,211,107,251,24,45,8,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
