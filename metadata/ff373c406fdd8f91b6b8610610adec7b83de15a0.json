Ellington only appears on three of this album's tracks. The album places Hodges at the fore, backing him with piano by Ellington or Billy Strayhorn and providing other accompaniment by well-known jazz figures like Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison and Jo Jones. The album, a follow-up to the popular Back to Back: Duke Ellington and Johnny Hodges Play the Blues, has remained perpetually in print and was among the first of the Verve Music Group catalog to be transferred to CD, on March 23, 1999\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.&quot;Stompy Jones&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:38\n2.&quot;Just Squeeze Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n3.&quot;Big Shoe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n4.&quot;Going Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n5.&quot;Just a Memory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:53\n6.&quot;Let's Fall in Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:47\n7.&quot;Ruint&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n8.&quot;Bend One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n9.&quot;You Need to Rock&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nTracks 1, 2 and 4\n\nDuke Ellington ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nJohnny Hodges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone: alto\nHarry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nLes Spann ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ flute, guitar\nAl Hall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJo Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\nRecorded February 20, 1959\n\nTracks 3 and 5 through 9\n\nJohnny Hodges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone: alto\nRoy Eldridge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nLawrence Brown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\nBen Webster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone: tenor\nBilly Strayhorn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nWendell Marshall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJo Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\nRecorded August 14, 1958","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff373c406fdd8f91b6b8610610adec7b83de15a0","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+and+Johnny+Hodges+Side+by+Side%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogerc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff373c406fdd8f91b6b8610610adec7b83de15a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,55,60,64,111,221,143,145,182,184,97,6,16,173,236,123,131,222,21,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
