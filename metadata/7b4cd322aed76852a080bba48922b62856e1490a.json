Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.\n\nAfter a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart.[1] After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that will be followed by a second hiatus for an undefined length of time.\n\nThe band has opened for various rock acts such as Heart, Robert Plant, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Dave Matthews Band, the Grateful Dead,[2] Aerosmith[3] and ZZ Top,[4] and performed live with Jimmy Page and Oasis, among others. The band has sold over 30 million albums,[2] and is listed at number 92 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.[5] They were also labeled by Melody Maker as &quot;The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World&quot;[6] and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them 'Best New American Band' in 1990. \n\n\n\n\n\nShake Your Money Maker 1990\n\n\nShake Your Money Maker is the debut album by the American blues-rock band The Black Crowes, released in January 1990 on Def American Recordings. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Jeff Cease. The album is named after a classic blues song written by Elmore James. The Black Crowes have played the song live many times over the years, but it is not included on this album. Shake Your Money Maker peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200, and two of its singles, &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; and &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;, reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Jealous Again&quot;, &quot;Twice As Hard&quot; and &quot;Seeing Things&quot; were also charting singles in the US.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Twice As Hard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n2.\t&quot;Jealous Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n3.\t&quot;Sister Luck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n4.\t&quot;Could I've Been So Blind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n5.\t&quot;Seeing Things&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n6.\t&quot;Hard to Handle&quot; (Allen Jones, Alvertis Isbell, Otis Redding) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n7.\t&quot;Thick n' Thin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n8.\t&quot;She Talks to Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n9.\t&quot;Struttin' Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n10.\t&quot;Stare It Cold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n11.\t&quot;Live Too Fast Blues/Mercy, Sweet Moan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:17 (unlisted track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Harmony and Musical Companion 1992\n\n\n\nThe Southern Harmony and Musical Companion is the second album by the American blues-rock group The Black Crowes, released on May 12, 1992. It was the first record by the band to feature Marc Ford on lead guitar, replacing Jeff Cease, who was fired the year before. It features four hit singles; &quot;Remedy&quot; (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for 11 weeks), &quot;Thorn in My Pride&quot; (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for four weeks), &quot;Sting Me&quot; (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for two weeks), and &quot;Hotel Illness&quot; (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for six weeks). It was a record for an album to feature four album rock number-one hits (previously set by Tom Petty in 1989, with three). The album itself reached the top spot of the Billboard 200 album chart, propelled by the success of these singles. In 2006, the album was ranked number 100 on Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Sting Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n2.\t&quot;Remedy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n3.\t&quot;Thorn in My Pride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n4.\t&quot;Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:28\n5.\t&quot;Sometimes Salvation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n6.\t&quot;Hotel Illness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n7.\t&quot;Black Moon Creeping&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n8.\t&quot;No Speak No Slave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n9.\t&quot;My Morning Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:15\n10.\t&quot;Time Will Tell&quot; (Bob Marley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmorica 1994\n\n\n\nAmorica is the third album by The Black Crowes. It was released in late 1994 on American Recordings and re-issued in the US and UK in 1998 with two bonus tracks. The album cover's depiction of pubic hair, from a 1976 United States Bicentennial issue of Hustler magazine,[4] caused controversy. The record company ended up putting out an alternative cover that blacked out the offending image. Amorica eventually reached Gold status in the United States, shipping 500,000 copies.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n2.\t&quot;A Conspiracy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n3.\t&quot;High Head Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n4.\t&quot;Cursed Diamond&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:56\n5.\t&quot;Nonfiction&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n6.\t&quot;She Gave Good Sunflower&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:48\n7.\t&quot;P.25 London&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n8.\t&quot;Ballad in Urgency&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n9.\t&quot;Wiser Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n10.\t&quot;Downtown Money Waster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n11.\t&quot;Descending&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Snakes And One Charm 1996\n\n\nThree Snakes and One Charm is the fourth album by the American blues-rock band The Black Crowes. It was released on July 23, 1996. The album's cover logo resembles a 45 rpm record insert. The limited box set edition of seven 7&quot; vinyl EPs included a custom adapter in shape of the logo.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Under a Mountain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n2.\t&quot;Good Friday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n3.\t&quot;Nebakanezer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n4.\t&quot;One Mirror Too Many&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n5.\t&quot;Blackberry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n6.\t&quot;Girl from a Pawnshop&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:17\n7.\t&quot;(Only) Halfway to Everywhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n8.\t&quot;Bring On, Bring On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n9.\t&quot;How Much for Your Wings?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n10.\t&quot;Let Me Share the Ride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n11.\t&quot;Better When You're Not Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n12.\t&quot;Evil Eye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Your Side 1999\n\n\n\nBy Your Side is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in early 1999 on Columbia Records, following the band's move from American Recordings. Second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left The Black Crowes in 1997. Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the band's new guitarist and bassist, respectively, though Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on By Your Side. The album was recorded in New York City during the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. By Your Side comprised songs written in the studio, revised songs from pre-production and re-recorded songs from the shelved album Band (1997).\n\nThe Black Crowes promoted By Your Side by performing on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. The album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990). Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Go Faster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n2.\t&quot;Kickin' My Heart Around&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n3.\t&quot;By Your Side&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n4.\t&quot;HorseHead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n5.\t&quot;Only a Fool&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n6.\t&quot;Heavy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n7.\t&quot;Welcome to the Goodtimes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n8.\t&quot;Go Tell the Congregation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n9.\t&quot;Diamond Ring&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n10.\t&quot;Then She Said My Name&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n11.\t&quot;Virtue and Vice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLions 2001\n\n\nLions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed. Lions was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by Don Was. Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was, as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. Lions received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of &quot;memorable&quot; songs. The critics who rated Lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band's influences, such as Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe band supported Lions with two North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. Soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Midnight from the Inside Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n2.\t&quot;Lickin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n3.\t&quot;Come On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n4.\t&quot;No Use Lying&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n5.\t&quot;Losing My Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n6.\t&quot;Ozone Mama&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n7.\t&quot;Greasy Grass River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n8.\t&quot;Soul Singing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n9.\t&quot;Miracle to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n10.\t&quot;Young Man, Old Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n11.\t&quot;Cosmic Friend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n12.\t&quot;Cypress Tree&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n13.\t&quot;Lay It All on Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarpaint 2008\n\n\n\nWarpaint is a 2008 album by blues-rock band The Black Crowes. Released on March 3, 2008, it was the band's first studio album in almost seven years, and its first with new members Luther Dickinson and Adam MacDougall, as well as the first to be released on the band's own Silver Arrow Records label. Despite its predecessor selling more copies, Warpaint debuted 15 spots higher in the United States.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n2.\t&quot;Walk Believer Walk&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n3.\t&quot;Oh Josephine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:38\n4.\t&quot;Evergreen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n5.\t&quot;Wee Who See the Deep&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50\n6.\t&quot;Locust Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n7.\t&quot;Movin' On Down the Line&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n8.\t&quot;Wounded Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n9.\t&quot;God's Got It&quot; (Rev.

Until The Freeze 2009\n\n\n\nBefore the Frost...Until the Freeze is a 2009 double album by blues-rock band The Black Crowes. It was recorded before a live audience at Levon Helm's Woodstock, NY studio, The Barn in late February and early March, 2009. [1] The album was produced by long time band collaborator Paul Stacey, and released on Silver Arrow Records. The CD itself is designed to have the appearance of a vinyl record. Originally, only the Before the Frost portion of the double album was available on CD, and the CD purchase came with a code allowing download of the Until the Freeze portion from the Black Crowes website. A vinyl version was also released, featuring all songs but in a different running order.\n\n\nBefore the Frost...Until the Freeze received generally favorable reviews upon its release, receiving a 75/100 critic score and a 9/10 user score on MetaCritic.[9] Paste Magazine noted the album &quot;captures the best aspects of one of rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest eras: a balance of structured songwriting and loose grooves, catchy choruses and meandering solos, hard rocking songs and easy-going attitude,&quot;[10] while All Music Guide note that the band &quot;wear their years proudly on this terrific album, sounding like the veteran roadhounds they've always aspired to be.&quot;[11] Many critics also noted the renewed stylistic approach of the band on Before the Frost..., with Uncut Magazine calling the album &quot;an inspired move&quot;[12] and The Record Review commenting that the record &quot;feels right, as if this is exactly the record that they needed to make at this point, both to separate from their musical past as well as to open up the future.&quot;\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Aimless Peacock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:40\n2.\t&quot;Good Morning Captain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n3.\t&quot;Been a Long Time (Waiting on Love)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:47\n4.\t&quot;Greenhorn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:12\n5.\t&quot;Appaloosa&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n6.\t&quot;The Shady Grove&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n7.\t&quot;The Garden Gate&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n8.\t&quot;Shine Along&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n9.\t&quot;Roll Old Jeremiah&quot; (C.

The set includes twenty tracks from the band's career, covering their albums from Shake Your Money Maker to Lions in mostly acoustic rearrangements, featuring a cover of the Chris Ethridge and Gram Parsons song &quot;She.&quot; Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine states the Crowes capture &quot;the sound of seasoned veterans still finding new ways to play old favorites&quot;[4] and the double album is &quot;a generous, entertaining gift to the fans who have stayed true throughout the years.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Jealous Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n2.\t&quot;Share the Ride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n3.\t&quot;Remedy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n4.\t&quot;Non-Fiction&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:54\n5.\t&quot;Hotel Illness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n6.\t&quot;Soul Singing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n7.\t&quot;Ballad in Urgency&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:16\n8.\t&quot;Wiser Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:33\n9.\t&quot;Cold Boy Smile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n10.\t&quot;Under a Mountain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n1.\t&quot;She Talks to Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16\n2.\t&quot;Morning Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:13\n3.\t&quot;Downtown Money Waster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n4.\t&quot;Good Friday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n5.\t&quot;Thorn In My Pride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:35\n6.\t&quot;Welcome to the Good Times&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n7.\t&quot;Girl from a Pawnshop&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08\n8.\t&quot;Sister Luck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n9.\t&quot;She&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n10.\t&quot;Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive At The Greek 2000\n\n\n\nLive at the Greek: Excess All Areas is a double live album by Jimmy Page and The Black Crowes, released by musicmaker.com on 29 February 2000 and later by TVT Records on 4 July 2000. In October 1999, Page teamed up with The Black Crowes for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. Due to contractual problems with their record company, The Black Crowes were unable to release any of their own songs which were played at the Greek shows. These songs, on which Jimmy Page played with the Crowes, included: &quot;Wiser Time&quot;, &quot;No Speak No Slave&quot;, &quot;Remedy&quot;, &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, and &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;. The double CD was released in stores by TVT Records on 4 July 2000, and featured a different track running order, an extra song, an enhanced Quicktime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album also features &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;In the Light&quot;, recorded in 2000.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Celebration Day&quot; (John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n2.\t&quot;Custard Pie&quot; (Page, Plant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n3.\t&quot;Sick Again&quot; (Page, Plant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n4.\t&quot;What Is and What Should Never Be&quot; (Page, Plant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n5.\t&quot;Woke up This Morning&quot; (B.B.
