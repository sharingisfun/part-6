The album wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t completely spareÃ¢â‚¬â€eventually slow pulls on the violin colored that opening song and JaffeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quivering vocals echoed to fill the empty spaces. But overall, it occupied that familiar ground between folk, roots rock and indie pop.\n\nHer follow-up The Body Wins, however, starts off more like Rufus WainwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operatic electro-pop masterpiece Want One. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ subtle electric guitar, woodwinds, organ and piano begin ever so quietly as Jaffe sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the seventh day, we set aside our brains/From an amateur hell/Regardless of age/And they will never know the things.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The song is followed immediately by brash horns on the title track, then keyboardsÃ¢â‚¬â€both industrial and playful on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Glorified High.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a stylistic leap that works, preserving much of what made Suburban Nature so enjoyable. In hindsight, that album was a lovely baseline full of wonderful melodies and heartbreaking lyrics upon which to decorate lavishly with whatever she and producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Wye Oak) might imagine.\n\nOn the middle third of the album, that direction is soulful and sad, punctuated by piano or organ and always that voiceÃ¢â‚¬â€powerful but restrained like deep water behind the dam. And that dam seems to be built from JaffeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncertainties, an ever-present discomfort with her own skin and a tentative approach to relationships. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I gave you my guts, you gave me your limbs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she accuses in the title track, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Still a mannequin woman/CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t set myself in motion,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she adds in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mannequin Woman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hooray For LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is sung like a dirgeÃ¢â‚¬â€more of a commemoration of what was than a celebration of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come.\n\nThings donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really pick back up in tempo until Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sucker For Your Marketing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with pounding drums, swelling stringsÃ¢â‚¬â€plus a cynical outlook on love and a melody that will stick in your brain. And penultimate song Ã¢â‚¬Å“TalkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ clashes New Wave atmospherics against industrial beats. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I feel ignorant to be certain/Strung out like a fool/I know I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to/But I know that I want you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not an album for those walking blind into love, but for those expecting (and experiencing) heartbreak at every turn. But for all its lovely wallowing, it ends with the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most uplifting track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“When You Rest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If not full of resolution, it at least allows for hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€and that sliver of hope in JaffeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics is surrounded musically by pure joy. Even when love doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t last, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a source of beauty.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c9a4fbc9286097a2f1250bed2596a07b77123b","amp;dn":"Sarah+Jaffe+-+The+Body+Wins+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c9a4fbc9286097a2f1250bed2596a07b77123b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,201,164,251,201,40,96,151,162,241,37,11,237,37,150,160,123,119,18,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
