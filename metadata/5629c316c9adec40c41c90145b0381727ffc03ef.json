Brand new album from THE HOLD\nSTEADY, and unquestionably their best to date;\nstronger songs, bigger production, Craig Finn sings\n(!) and the band is so unbelievably smoking, that no\nmetaphor could possibly do them justice! Produced by\nJON AGNELLO (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., The\nBreeders, Mark Lanegan, Son Volt), the guitars are\nhuge, the piano grand, bass pounding, drums\ncracking, brass belting. it&amp;#039;s one of the most\ncrankable rock records of the year!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5629c316c9adec40c41c90145b0381727ffc03ef","amp;dn":"The_Hold_Steady-Boys_And_Girls_In_America_%28Australian_Retail%29-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5629c316c9adec40c41c90145b0381727ffc03ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,41,195,22,201,173,236,64,196,28,144,20,91,3,129,114,127,252,3,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
