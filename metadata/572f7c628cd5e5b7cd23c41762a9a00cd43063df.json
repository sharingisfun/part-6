In\nthis chapter, we are going to look at the history of\nhydrogen and the fuel cell, which puts the projects\nwe are going to do in the rest of this book into\ncontext. Know that as you work through the projects\nin the book, you are following in the footsteps of\nsome of the great scientists and engineers mentioned\nin this chapter. Become a proficient fuel cell\nscientist and your name could well be added to this\nlist in years to come!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:572f7c628cd5e5b7cd23c41762a9a00cd43063df","amp;dn":"Fuel+Cell+Projects+for+the+Evil+Genius","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"572f7c628cd5e5b7cd23c41762a9a00cd43063df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,47,124,98,140,213,229,183,205,35,196,23,98,169,160,12,212,48,99,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
