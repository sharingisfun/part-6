But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.\n\nShe floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye. But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons. Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving....\n\nAnd returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\n\n\n\nThe Nelson Touch: Ark Royal, Book 2\nLength: 13 hrs and 31 mins\n\nArk Royal - the Royal NavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outdated space carrier - has won a smashing victory against the enigmatic aliens, capturing one of their starships and returning to Earth. Now, Admiral Theodore Smith and his crew are assigned to command a fleet charged with making a deep-penetration raid into alien territory, a fleet made up of carriers from four different nations. But with a crewman who isn't what he seems, untested pilots and international friction - and a new and dangerous alien plan - can Ted and his crew survive their mission...or will they die, alone and unremarked, hundreds of light years from home?\n\nThe Trafalgar Gambit: Ark Royal, Book 3\nLength: 14 hrs and 5 mins\n\nHumanity is losing the war. The once-mighty space navies have been crippled, officers and crew have been stretched to the limit, and Earth herself has come under heavy attack. The end cannot be long delayed. For Admiral Smith and the crew of HMS Ark Royal, the stakes have never been so high. The one hope is to make contact with alien factions that might oppose the war. But, as Ark Royal sets off on a desperate diplomatic mission, it rapidly becomes clear that there are both human and alien factions that wish to fight the war to the bitter end - and that her previous missions have sown the seeds of success...or total failure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ee2be310edea3fd10bf53ab772771b74378598","amp;dn":"Christopher+G.+Nuttall+-+Ark+Royal+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ee2be310edea3fd10bf53ab772771b74378598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,238,43,227,16,237,234,63,209,11,245,58,183,114,119,27,116,55,133,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
