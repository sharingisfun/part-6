In autumn, white beans mingle with sturdy greens in satisfying, peasant-style pots, and starchy squashes and root vegetables blend into silky purÃƒÂ©es. Winter brings even more soul-warming fare, such as chilis and stews featuring sausages and other hearty meats and thick vegetable soups scented with woodsy herbs. \n\n\n Williams-Sonoma Soup of the Day offers a tantalizing collection of 365 soup recipes: one for each day of the year.
