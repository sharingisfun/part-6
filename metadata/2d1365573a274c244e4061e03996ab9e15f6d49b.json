I did not create any of these videos myself\n\n\nMy story...\n\n\nThe late 70's and 80's were a time when pinball arcades could be found in any\nmall, bowling alley or truck stop. \n\nYouths hung around the arcades spending their hard earned allowances or paper-route\nearnings. The cooler kids could be found outside smoking and trying to look\n'cool' while skipping school.\n\nIt was a much simpler time without 64-bit arcade games, Playstations or X-Boxes. Kids would\nactually play outside until the sun went down and parents called them indoors for the night.\nToday the kids hibernate in their rooms as they play home video games.\n\nWherever a pinball arcade could be found, so could the assorted graffiti and\ncigarette burns (grr) which would be inflicted upon the various pinball machines. Yes,\nthis was where the delinquents and tough guys hung out.\n\nI can remember my first few years venturing into our local arcade which was named Little Joe's\nand located in our shopping mall here in Ontario, Canada. There I would plop quarters into the\nvideo games and spend hours at a time playing. While I'd seen the pinball machines located\nalong the other wall, I had no interest in playing them.\n\nMy time was spent playing video games consisting of such classics as Galaxian, a submarine\ngame in which you shot at enemy subs through a periscope and Crazy Climber, to name just\na few.\n\nOut of boredom one day, I plopped a quarter (just one was needed) into a pinball machine\njust to try it out. From that point on I became addicted. I blew so much of my paper route\nmoney in that arcade, trying out the various pins. It was always a wonderous new day when\na &quot;new&quot; pinball arrived. I remember the day that Firepower made its way to the arcade, brand\nspanking new. I was so impressed by the backglass, the colors and the amazing sound that I swore\none day I would own it. Well, it's 2008 and I don't own a single pinball machine nor am I\nall that impressed by Firepower any longer. Black Knight however, remains an obsession and\nI am determined to one day own it - or BK2000.\n\nWhen I was about 11 years old, I tried to make a pinball machine out of an old table top,\nnails, elastics and two allen-keys to use as flippers. The scoring was done via a calculator\non top of the tabletop. Needless to say trying to play the game while keeping score with\nthe calculator did not go over so well.\n\nI did own a Harlem Globetrotter but became bored with it. I bought and sold it for $100\nalthough I am now regetting it due to the tight market.\n\nI always wondered what happened to those old pinball machines - the Stern &quot;Meteor&quot;, the\n&quot;Black Knight&quot;, and the &quot;Big Game&quot;. Did they get parted out and end up in a landfill site? Did\nthey find their way into collector's homes, or do they lie waiting to be discovered one\nday in an old storage shed?\n\nThat era is gone forever and will never be recreated. The arcades are no longer financially\nsustainable. Today's arcades feature video games and kid's whack-a-mole games which will\ndispense tickets to be redeemed for stuffed aminals. Our last &quot;true&quot; arcade closed it's doors\napproximately four years ago.\n\nWilliams was always my favourite, you know. They could design a pinball based on any\ntheme - be it playing poker with aliens, giving a robot a set of eyes or fighting a\nknight.\n\nToday's market is much more delicate. No longer can a pinball be created based on a designer's\nimagination. The machines of today are lisensed after television shows or movies (eg. Shrek).\n\nThose kids with the rock and roll t-shirts and long hair have grown up and have their\nown families now. The old pool hall with its grungy clientelle, four pinball machines\nand snack bar has been replaced by a paint store. \n\n\nIndex of video\n==============\n\n1) Hands on History - The History Channel [30 minutes]\n\nA look at the start-to-finish process of building a pinball machine.
