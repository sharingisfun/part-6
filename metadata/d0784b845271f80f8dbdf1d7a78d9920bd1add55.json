The original line-up included then-buddy of mine and the coolest guy ever, Dale Martindale (vocals), Don Gordon (guitar), Joe Vizvary and Glen Nelson (synthesizers), Gary Smith (bass), and Kevin Crompton (drums, percussion). Their music is classified as New Wave and embodies all that was exciting about 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s electronica.\n\nImages spent nearly 4 years establishing themselves by releasing singles and EPs. A single from one of their earlier EPs, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLust for Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ made the charts in 1983 and gave this promising band its foothold in the burgeoning 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s New Wave music scene. Gordon left the band in 1984 and was replaced by Ed Shaw. Images finally released a full-length LP in 1985 called In the House.\n\nMore personnel changes plagued the stability of the band. Crompton left the band in 1986 to turn his attention toward the up-and-coming Skinny Puppy, and was replaced by Derrick Gyles. Nelson was the next one to leave, replaced by Tim Welch. On a brighter note, Images In Vogue were the 1986 recipients of the coveted CASBY Award for Single of the Year (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn The HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and Group of the Year; truly a bittersweet moment in time for a group going through so much upheaval.\n\nThe band stabilized long enough to release another full-length LP called The Spell in 1988. The record did not do well, and their record company failed to support them. That, coupled with Gary SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exit from the band, sealed the decision for Images to give a final concert in Toronto and disband in 1991.\n\nWell listen to this band and I guarantee youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find yourself wondering why Images In Vogue was not a part of your vital 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s catalogue of music.
