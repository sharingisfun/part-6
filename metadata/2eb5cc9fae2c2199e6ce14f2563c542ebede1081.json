J Davies (Editor), Kristian C. Gustafson (Editor)\nPaperback: 320 pages\nPublisher: Georgetown University Press (March 15, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1589019563\nISBN-13: 978-1589019560\n\nBook Description\nPublication Date: March 15, 2013\nSpying, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second oldest profession,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is hardly limited to the traditional great power countries. Intelligence Elsewhere, nevertheless, is the first scholarly volume to deal exclusively with the comparative study of national intelligence outside of the anglosphere and European mainstream. Past studies of intelligence and counterintelligence have tended to focus on countries such as the United States, Great Britain, and Russia, as well as, to a lesser extent, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. This volume examines the deep historical and cultural origins of intelligence in several countries of critical importance today: India, China, the Arab world, and indeed, Russia, the latter examined from a fresh perspective. The authors then delve into modern intelligence practice in countries with organizations significantly different from the mainstream: Iran, Pakistan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Indonesia, Argentina, and Ghana.\n\nWith contributions by leading intelligence experts for each country, the chapters give the reader important insights into intelligence culture, current practice, and security sector reform. As the world morphs into an increasingly multi-polar system, it is more important than ever to understand the national intelligence systems of rising powers and regional powers that differ significantly from those of the US, its NATO allies, and its traditional opponents. This fascinating book shines new light into intelligence practices in regions that, until now, have eluded our understanding.\n\nReviews\n&quot;The book is a fine contribution to the field of intelligence studies and would be of interest to a wide variety of readers.&quot; -- Choice\n\n&quot;A fantastic compendium on intelligence outside the Anglosphere. Required reading for all students of intelligence.&quot; -- Michael S. Goodman, senior lecturer, King's College London\n\n&quot; Intelligence Elsewhere is a unique blend of historical and cultural analysis of the diverse foreign intelligence services that stand outside the well-known Anglo-American relationship. It reminds us that in many parts of the world, intelligence not only reflects the societies in which it operates but also shapes the way those countries perceive their interests and world.&quot; -- Roger George, professor of national security strategy, National War College\n\nAbout the Author\nPhilip H.
