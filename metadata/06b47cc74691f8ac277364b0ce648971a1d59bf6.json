The first film in the franchise was originally released on May 25, 1977, under the title Star Wars, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released, again released at three-year intervals, with the final film released on May 19, 2005.\n\nAs of 2008, the overall box office revenue generated by the six Star Wars films has totalled approximately $4.41 billion, making it the third-highest-grossing film series, behind only the James Bond and Harry Potter films.\n\nThe Star Wars film series has spawned other media including books, television series, video games, and comic books. These supplements to the film trilogies comprise the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and have resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe. These media kept the franchise going in the interim between the film trilogies. In 2008, Star Wars: The Clone Wars was released to theaters as the first ever worldwide theatrical Star Wars film outside of the main trilogies. It was the franchise's first animated film, and was intended as an introduction to the Expanded Universe series of the same name, a 3D CGI animated series based on a previous 2D animated series of a similar name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b47cc74691f8ac277364b0ce648971a1d59bf6","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Deluxe+DVD+Boxset+Part+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6+%26+7+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b47cc74691f8ac277364b0ce648971a1d59bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,180,124,199,70,145,248,172,39,115,100,176,206,100,137,113,161,213,155,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
