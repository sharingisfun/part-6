The album was released on December 7, 2010. It is the first film score released by Daft Punk.\n\nTRON: Legacy director Joseph Kosinski and music supervisor Jason Bentley approached Daft Punk and requested that the duo compose the film score. When asked why he wished to work with the duo, Kosinski replied, &quot;How could you not at least go to those guys?&quot; The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Kosinski referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk had previously produced the IrrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©versible soundtrack and served as sound effects director for the film Enter the Void.\n\nCommenting on the TRON: Legacy score, Bangalter noted that &quot;We knew from the start that there was no way we were going to do this film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Daft Punk cited Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Carpenter, Vangelis and Maurice Jarre as inspiration for the soundtrack. Guy-Manuel de Homem Christo also stated that the original Tron film was a strong influence on him as a child. &quot;Maybe I only saw it two or three times in my entire life, but the feel of it is strong even now, that I think the imprint of the first [film] will not be erased by the new one. It has a real visionary quality to it.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n01. Overture (2:28)\n02. The Grid (1:37)\n03. The Son of Flynn (1:35)\n04. Recognizer (2:38)\n05. Armory (2:03)\n06. Arena (1:33)\n07.
