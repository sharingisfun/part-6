Features an array of guests, including Japanese pop star Saori Yuki and NPR correspondent Ari Shapiro, backed by a fabulous gathering of Portland choirs. This new CD features gorgeous 3-D packaging each layer of buildings will be a separate flap, giving the city four layers of die-cut depth. The digipak will be covered by a clear plastic panel, on which the album title will be printed, along with delicate white snowflakes that will appear to float in front of the city. \n\nAllmusic Review:\nJust when it feels like every possible version of every possible holiday song has been recorded already, Pink MartiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Joy to the World finds ways to revive holiday spirits. While the band could very easily do a swanky lounge-pop album of the seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs, this globally minded collection is traditional and unpredictable at the same time. Pink Martini begins Joy to the World with an intimate rendition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite ChristmasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so faithful to the original that it features the sunny California prelude that was included when it debuted in the film Holiday Inn, then they follow it with a lush orchestral rendition -- sung in Japanese. Yet quirks like these donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel kitschy; aside from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSanta Baby,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Joy to the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lone indulgence in camp, the album sings of peace and celebration in many tongues. Whether they give ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLittle Drummer BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½'s arrangement a Middle Eastern-meets-lounge twist or sing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilent NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in German, Arabic, and English, Pink Martini ensures this is truly a multicultural party. The group even makes fresh choices for Hanukkah and New YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, presenting the conclusion of the Amidah prayer set to music (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œElohai, NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢tzorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOcho Kandelikas,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a Sephardic song sung in Ladino. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCongratulations,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a song for the Chinese New Year, is such a breath of fresh air compared to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAuld Lang SyneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to forget that this song would normally be heard in late January or early February instead of the end of December. And when ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAuld Lang SyneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ arrives with an arrangement inspired by Brazilian Carnaval music, it sends off the album, and the year, with a huge celebration. A near-perfect blend of spirituality and festivity, Joy to the World lets listeners hear the holidays with new ears, and maybe see it with fresh eyes, too. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f86e3f1cba92ba35abbe131cef0dc6b2971a81","amp;dn":"Pink+Martini+-+Joy+to+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f86e3f1cba92ba35abbe131cef0dc6b2971a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,248,110,63,28,186,146,186,53,171,190,19,28,239,13,198,178,151,26,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
