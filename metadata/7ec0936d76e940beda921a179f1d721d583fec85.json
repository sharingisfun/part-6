El-Hawary, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIntroduction to Electrical Power SystemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nWiley-IEEE Press | 2008 | ISBN: 0470408634 | 394 pages | PDF \n\nAdapted from an updated version of the author's classic Electric Power System Design and Analysis, with new material designed for the undergraduate student and professionals new to Power Engineering. The growing importance of renewable energy sources, control methods and mechanisms, and system restoration has created a need for a concise, comprehensive text that covers the concepts associated with electric power and energy systems. \n\nIntroduction to Electric Power Systems fills that need, providing an up-to-date introduction to this dynamic field. The author begins with a discussion of the modern electric power system, centering on the technical aspects of power generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization. After providing an overview of electric power and machine theory fundamentals, he offers a practical treatment-focused on applications-of the major topics required for a solid background in the field, including synchronous machines, transformers, and electric motors. \n\nHe also furnishes a unique look at activities related to power systems, such as power flow and control, stability, state estimation, and security assessment. A discussion of present and future directions of the electrical energy field rounds out the text. With its broad, up-to-date coverage, emphasis on applications, and integrated MATLAB scripts, Introduction to Electric Power Systems provides an ideal, practical introduction to the field-perfect for self-study or short-course work for professionals in related disciplines.
