In reading China's military manual 'Unrestricted Warfare', you will learn that the events of September 11 were not a random act perpetrated by independent agents. Instead, Chinese military planners believe that terrorism is just one of the many tools at the hands of nations and their terrorist allies to wage total war against the United States. You will be surprised to learn: The two PLA colonels who authored Unrestricted Warfare have been hailed as heroes in China since September 11; The Chinese state-run propaganda machine is cashing in on the terror attacks ...producing books, films and video games glorifying the strikes as a humbling blow against an arrogant nation; Chinese Communist Party officials are saying that President Jiang Zemin has obsessively and gleefully watched and re-watched pictures of the aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center; The CIA's own translation agency reported that this book identifies the U. S. as Chinas main enemy, and details how a weak nation can destroy America using unorthodox attacks -- like the 9-11 attacks. China is preparing itself and encouraging others to engage the U.S. in total war. The book is full of plans and strategies, from using computers, to smuggling illegal immigrants, to manipulating the stock markets, to influencing the U.S. media, to using weapons of mass destruction -- all to destroy America. Recent press reports indicate that China has assisted and continues to assist militarily and economically the Taliban and al-Qaeda even after September 11. The doctrine of total war outlined in 'Unrestricted Warfare' clearly demonstrates that the People's Republic of China is preparing to confront the United States and our allies by conducting &quot;asymmetrical&quot; or multidimensional attacks on almost every aspect of our social, economic and political life. The media and Congress are keeping a lid on this book because of the implications of U.S.-China economic and trade relations.
