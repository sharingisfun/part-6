Apart from the\npreviously released &quot;Cowboys&quot; (which has been reworked for the\nrecord), all of the material featured has been produced\nespecially for the album, with Boxer promising a coherent and\nimmersive listening experience once the record drops in April.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b905598e0ff70bd9ebd8321159005cef0b88fa","amp;dn":"Dusty_Kid-A_Ravers_Diary-%28Advance%29-2009-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b905598e0ff70bd9ebd8321159005cef0b88fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,185,5,89,142,15,247,11,217,235,216,50,17,89,0,92,239,11,136,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
