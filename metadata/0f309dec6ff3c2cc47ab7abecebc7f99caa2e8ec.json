A humble workhorse used for generations to crisp bacon perfectly and fry chicken, the cast-iron skillet can also turn out tender scones, cakes, and breads. A curious home cook, Charlotte Druckman has figured out every trick for this versatile pan. Heat the skillet for a few minutes, add some butter to sizzle, and you can brown cheesy arepas, get a crunchy crust on a kimchi-topped hoecake, or blister naan right on the stovetop. Or preheat the pan in the oven and youâ€™re ready to bake no-knead pizza, the gooiest sticky buns, and even a cornflake-milk layer cake. With beautiful photographs, tips for seasoning cast iron, and info on collecting vintage pieces, this book makes cooking so much fun that your skillet will never see the cupboard.\r\n\r\nStir, Sizzle, Bake: Recipes for Your Cast-Iron Skillet\r\nEnglish | ISBN: 055345966X | 2016 | ePUB | 224 pages | 46.66 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f309dec6ff3c2cc47ab7abecebc7f99caa2e8ec","amp;dn":"Stir%2C+Sizzle%2C+Bake%3A+Recipes+for+Your+Cast-Iron+Skillet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f309dec6ff3c2cc47ab7abecebc7f99caa2e8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,48,157,236,111,243,194,204,71,171,122,190,206,188,127,153,202,162,232,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
