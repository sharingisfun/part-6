Personal space flight is becoming illegal all over the world. Grounded space pilot Mary Raven has to journey to Earths last spaceport, the island of Ignition City, to recover her dead fathers effects -- and discovers, there in the lawless interzone of the ramshackle settlement raised inside the ring of launch pads, that her father died on the wrong end of a ray-gun. She's not going to leave until she finds out who killed Rock Raven, but theres a lot of people whod rather feed her to the recycling chipper first...
