It's easier to return shit.&quot; - Dennis Miller\n\n\nChosen by BusinessWeek as One of the Top Ten Business Books of the Year\n\nSynopsis: From the acclaimed authors of A Future Perfect comes the untold story of how the company became the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful institution.\n\nLike all groundbreaking books, The Company fills a hole we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know existed, revealing that we cannot make sense of the past four hundred years until we place that seemingly humble Victorian innovation, the joint-stock company, in the center of the frame.\n\nWith their trademark authority and wit, Economist editors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge reveal the company to be one of historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great catalysts, for good and for ill, a mighty engine for sucking in, recombining, and pumping out money, goods, people, and culture to every corner of the globe. What other earthly invention has the power to grow to any size, and to live to any age? What else could have given us both the stock market and the British Empire? The company man, the company town, and company time? Disneyfication and McDonaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sization, to say nothing of Coca-colonialism? Through its many mutations, the company has always incited controversy, and governments have always fought to rein it in. Today, though Marx may spin in his grave and anarchists riot in the streets, the company exercises an unparalleled influence on the globe, and understanding what this creature is and where it comes from has never been a more pressing matter. To the rescue come these acclaimed authors, with a short volume of truly vast range and insight.\n\nAuthor: John Micklethwait/ Adrian Wooldridge (Narrator) Jonathan Davis\n\nGenre: NonFiction; History; Business, Economics\n\nPublisher: Recorded Books, LLC (Feb 2003)\n\nFormat: 107 mp3 files\n\nDuration: 6 hrs  46 mins\n\nISBN: 978-0-8129-7287-0 (0-8129-7287-2)\n\nAudio codec: 1.70 MB (1,748 KB / 1,790,561 bytes)\n\nAudio Info: 22050Hz  64 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo  \n\nLanguage: English\n\n\nJohn Micklethwait is Editor-in-Chief of The Economist.
