You will need to fight for survival while exploring the dark and claustrophobic environments both at sea and as the action moves to dry land.\n\nTaking place in 2005, between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the action centers on BSAA member Jill Valentine and introduces her new partner Parker Luciani. They have been sent to search for Chris Redfield, whose last known GPS data positions him as being on the ship. Far from being empty, danger lurks around every corner as Jill and Parker explore the confined space of the ship and must face a menacing new enemy that emerges from the darkness.\nRelease Date: May 21. 2013\nMSRP: 49.99 USD\nM for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Language\nGenre: Action\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\n\n OS\n\n Required: XP or later\n Recommended: Vista or later\n\nCPU\n\n Required: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz or better | AMD Athlon X2 2.8 Ghz or better\n Recommended: Intel Core 2 Quad 2.7 Ghz or better | AMD Phenom II X4 3 Ghz or better\n\nMemory\n\n Required: 2 GB RAM\n Recommended: 4 GB RAM\n Hard disk space: 8GB or more\n\nDisplay\n\n Required: 800Ãƒâ€”600 or higher\n Recommended: 1280Ãƒâ€”720 or higher\n\nDVD drive\n\n Required: DVD9-compatible\n\nVideo card (onboard graphics not guaranteed to work)\n\n Required: VRAMÃ¯Â¼Ë†256MB or more | NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS or better | ATI Radeon HD3850 or better\n Recommended: VRAMÃ¯Â¼Ë†512MB or more) | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or better | ATI Radeon HD6950 or better\n\nSound card\n\n DirectSound supported with DirectX9.0c or better\n\nInput device\n\n Required: Mouse &amp; keyboard\n Supported: Gamepad (Xbox 360 Controller for Windows recommended)\n\nDirect X\n\n Required: DirectX 9.0c or later\n\nNetwork connection\n\n Required: Steam used for network connections\n\n1.
