By analyzing the visual elements and techniques of artists through the centuries, we have designed Snap Art to produce images that look they were made by a human, not a computer.\r\n\r\nSnap Art 4 lets you experiment with multiple artistic styles via a simple, sleek user interface. The refreshed design and layout reduces distractions and provides fast visual browsing of a wide array of presets so you can achieve perfect results quicker than ever. Snap Art works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a standalone application that provides easy batch processing.\r\n\r\nArtistic Expression Made Simple\r\nWith Snap Art, no hand-eye coordination or technical training is required. You make the creative choices to turn your artistic vision into reality and leave the brushwork to Snap Art.\r\n\r\nSelect a style from one of Snap Artâ€™s many presets such as oil painting, pencil sketch, crayon and watercolor, and Snap Art will take care of everything for you. You can then use Snap Artâ€™s detail mask to hone and refine the individual nuances of specific areas of interest on your canvas. The end product is a finished piece of art worthy of printing on canvas and hanging in a gallery.\r\n\r\nFind Your Own Style\r\nSnap Art comes loaded with a wide variety of presets, but they are just starting points for your own unique style. If you discover a preset that sparks an idea, itâ€™s easy to mold it to fit your needs. Save your new look as a preset with a name, category, and even include notes. Later, you can apply it to a photo (or batches of photos) with a single click.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.alienskin.com/snapart/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbd1c4bfb2e2eaf7b5590ea012df44ccf8b206f","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Snap+Art+4.1.0.119+Revision+33758","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcbd1c4bfb2e2eaf7b5590ea012df44ccf8b206f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,189,28,75,251,46,46,175,123,85,144,234,1,45,244,76,207,139,32,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
