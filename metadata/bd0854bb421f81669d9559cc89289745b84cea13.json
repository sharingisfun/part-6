Not an easy task for a She-dragon of royal descent. But the evil plots of her father are turning her quiet, boring life upside down, and she has now become the enemy of the most vicious queen her kind has ever known. But for once, Braith won't have to fight alone. Not when the warrior dragon of her dreams is willing to risk everything to save her neck.\n\nAddolgar the Cheerful wishes he could say heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helping the pretty royal strictly for honorable reasons - but he'd be lying. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not his fault, though! He didn't tell Braith of the Darkness to have the most delicious tail heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever seen! Yet before Addolgar can get his very strong claws on that tail, heads are going to roll. Just hopefully not theirs...\nGenre: Paranormal Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0854bb421f81669d9559cc89289745b84cea13","amp;dn":"A+Tale+Of+Two+Dragons+-+G.+A.+Aiken.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0854bb421f81669d9559cc89289745b84cea13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,8,84,187,66,31,129,102,157,149,89,204,137,40,151,69,184,76,234,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
