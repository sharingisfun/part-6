The scope of dynamic meteorology has broadened considerably. Much of the material is based on a two-term course for seniors majoring in atmospheric sciences.\n\nThis book presents a cogent explanation of the fundamentals of meteorology and explains storm dynamics for weather-oriented meteorologists. It discusses climate dynamics and the implications posed for global change. The new edition has added a companion website with MATLAB exercises and updated treatments of several key topics.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Provides clear physical explanations of key dynamical principles\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Contains a wealth of illustrations to elucidate text and equations, plus end-of-chapter problems\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Holton is one of the leading authorities in contemporary meteorology, and well known for his clear writing style\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Instructor's Manual available to adopters\n\nNEW IN THIS EDITION\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢A companion website with MATLABÃ‚Â® exercises and demonstrations\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Updated treatments on climate dynamics, tropical meteorology, middle atmosphere dynamics, and numerical prediction\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a6dc00d90813fb02f05f8df0b8974304c3b92f","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Dynamic+Meteorology+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a6dc00d90813fb02f05f8df0b8974304c3b92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,166,220,0,217,8,19,251,2,240,95,141,240,184,151,67,4,195,185,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
