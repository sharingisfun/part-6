Freedom Road\n\nBeans on Toast is back with his new album Ã¢â‚¬ËœFishing For A Thank YouÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ. His everyday observations offer a gentle and, as ever, peaceful wake up callÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and maybe hope, as he provides his often stark but witty insights into Middle England. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the sort of artist the Daily Mail are going to get excited about, a good thing in our books.\n\nHe turns many stones within these 12 tracks from scraping away the surface behind the fighting at the petrol pumps during the fuel shortages (The Dry War) to the continual press onslaught of what will kill us (The Children of Bedford). Not forgetting of course the preoccupation of phones which were once used to talk to people:\nThe recession of course gets a mentionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ for which he steps up to the mark with a countryfied Ã¢â‚¬ËœRainydaysÃ¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the one we were meant to save up for. All these topics may sound depressingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦they can beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but Beans on Toast somehow manages to inject the right dosage of humour and upbeat wit to make it all feel betterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this is great therapy for the tiny cogs in a big world.\n\nWe love him for his honesty which strides the political to the social including having kids with PappajaY. Needless to say he balances it all off with some positive vibes with Ã¢â‚¬ËœLifeÃ¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and a fitting closing tale Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Freedom RoadÃ¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦about a trip to Latvia where he ended up on the road.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3b78d59fcc6b723b7dc7e5ad1ebb8d04eb72a7","amp;dn":"Beans+on+Toast+-+Fishing+for+a+Thank+You+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3b78d59fcc6b723b7dc7e5ad1ebb8d04eb72a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,59,120,213,159,204,107,114,59,125,199,229,173,30,187,141,4,235,114,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
