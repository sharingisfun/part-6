Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make \nthe uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.\n\nProbabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, \nand extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, \nthe text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques.\n Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty.\n\nThe main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. \nMost chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related \nto the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and \nconcept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in \nvarious combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f26ae72265269884f9b69ca0b2701f2615c2a19","amp;dn":"Probabilistic+Graphical+Models-+Principles+and+Techniques%5BTeam+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f26ae72265269884f9b69ca0b2701f2615c2a19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,38,174,114,38,82,105,136,79,155,105,202,11,39,1,242,97,92,42,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
