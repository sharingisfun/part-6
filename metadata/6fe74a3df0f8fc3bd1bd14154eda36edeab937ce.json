It uses traditional 2D animation with some 3D. The film received mixed reviews. Also, the abandonment of the story's Arabic roots in favor of a Greek setting was brought up as a matter of discussion.\n\nThis is the last traditionally-animated feature film made by DreamWorks Animation, due to being considered a commercial disaster and Dreamworks' decision that the American public would be more interested in computer animation. However, the film retains a cult following.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe74a3df0f8fc3bd1bd14154eda36edeab937ce","amp;dn":"Sinbad%3A+Legend+of+the+Seven+Seas+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe74a3df0f8fc3bd1bd14154eda36edeab937ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,231,74,61,240,248,252,59,209,189,20,21,78,218,54,237,234,185,55,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
