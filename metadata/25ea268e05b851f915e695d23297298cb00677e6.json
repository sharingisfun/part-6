They turn to the high-powered toolset in CINEMA 4D. In this course, EJ Hassenfratz shows you how to use those same tools to create your own dynamic, high-energy sports bumper. Learn how to model the basic elements in C4D and add robotic-style movement with the Mograph module, and take a logo from Adobe Illustrator and turn it into a smart, beveled 3D project. Then EJ shows how to combine it all in After Effects, along with a few special effects. This workflow mimics a real post-production environment and allows a more intermediate look at the mograph module and an opportunity to take your motion graphics knowledge to the next level.\n\nTopics include:\n\n   Modeling 3D elements with NURBs\n   Animating with the Shader Effector\n   Importing artwork from Illustrator with ArtSmart2 and Extruding\n   Creating and applying textures\n   Adding camera movement\n   Lighting the scene\n   Rendering\n   Compositing in After Effects\n   Adding optical flares and motion blur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25ea268e05b851f915e695d23297298cb00677e6","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Motion+Graphic_Creating+a+Sports+Bumper+%7C+Exercise+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25ea268e05b851f915e695d23297298cb00677e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,234,38,142,5,184,81,249,21,230,149,210,50,151,41,140,176,6,119,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
