The author draws on more than 20 years of experience doing hands-on science to facilitate tinkering: learning science while fooling around with real things. Updated with new photographs and in full color, this new edition is even more accessible to young makers or young-at-heart makers.\r\n\r\nIn this book, you'll learn:\r\n- Tinkering techniques in key science areas\r\n- How to let kids learn science with hands-on tinkering\r\n- Engaging techniques for science learning at home, in school, or at a makerspace or library\r\n- Step-by-step instructions for activities that don't end with a single project, but that provide many paths for &quot;tinkering forward&quot;.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nCurt Gabrielson runs the Watsonville Environmental Science Workshop and works with science education in East Timor. He has been a science educator for more than 20 years, with positions in the California public schools, the National University of East Timor, and San Franciscoâ€™s Exploratorium Teacher Institute.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nForeword\r\nPreface\r\n1.Sound\r\n2.The Value of Tinkering in the Learning Process\r\n3.Magnetism\r\n4.A Good Tinkering Session\r\n5.Mechanics\r\n6.Tinkering Logistics\r\n7.Electric Circuits\r\n8.The Learning Community &amp; Differentiated Learning\r\n9.Chemistry\r\n10.Dealing with Questions and Dishing Out Answers\r\n11.Biology\r\n12.Standards and Assessment in the Tinkering Environment\r\n13.Engineering and Motors\r\n14.Final Notes\r\nA.Academic Research On How Learning Works\r\nB.Evaluation Questionnaire for\r\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb4a5b0bade740ec360396c102b62b7622b671eb","amp;dn":"Tinkering+-+Kids+Learn+by+Making+Stuff+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb4a5b0bade740ec360396c102b62b7622b671eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,74,91,11,173,231,64,236,54,3,150,193,2,182,43,118,34,182,113,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
