Prof Iain Stewart shows that where the South of Eurasia is today there was once a ninety-million-square-kilometre Ocean known as the Tethys. It is the destruction of the Tethys Ocean that holds the key to Eurasia's formation. But the formation of Eurasia is just the beginning of the story, because the process that formed it is still active today. Prof Stewart travels to the island of Stromboli, Italy's most continually active volcano. The volcano's spectacular eruptions show that the ocean floor is being pulled beneath Eurasia. It is this process that closed the Tethys, and today is closing the Mediterranean, revealing Eurasia's future. 250 million years in the future all of the continents will collide together once more, forming a new Pangea, with Eurasia right at its heart.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------ \n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;125a7b757a525e263c23&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 1.60 GB (average)\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c64936b80f9645d880f3e6dfba5990091e69600","amp;dn":"BBC+Rise+of+the+Continents+4of4+Eurasia+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c64936b80f9645d880f3e6dfba5990091e69600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,100,147,107,128,249,100,93,136,15,62,109,251,165,153,0,145,230,150,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
