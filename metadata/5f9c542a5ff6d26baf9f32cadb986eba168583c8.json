Over a quarter million copies sold in this series to-date! Space ships, action, adventure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all tied together with a strong dollop of romance and family saga Ã¢â‚¬â€œ make this a compelling series for a wide range of readers, from romance to military SF lovers alike.\n\nTheo Waitley is an ace starship pilot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and pure maverick. Her mom is a renowned Terran scholar and her birth father is an interstellar aristocrat in hiding. She still feels like a socially challenged misfit. But after being selected to train with the best-of-the-best at the pilot academy, she figures she can leave behind those gawky, misfit days of teenage angst that made life so complicated before! But for Theo, life is about to get even MORE complicated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and deadlier still. For even though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survived the Academy and become one of the best pilots in the galaxy, the past is about to blast her with gale-force winds. Theo can run, but she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hide. Her destiny as master pilot and leader of a powerful Liaden clan calls, and there are lots of enemies who will try to make sure sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite dead before she has the chance to make an answer.\n\n\nNarrated by: Eileen Stevens\nLength: 11 hrs and 48 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-04-12\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9c542a5ff6d26baf9f32cadb986eba168583c8","amp;dn":"Sharon+Lee%2C+Steve+Miller+-+Ghost+Ship+%28Liaden+Universe+15%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9c542a5ff6d26baf9f32cadb986eba168583c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,156,84,42,95,246,210,107,175,159,50,202,219,152,110,186,22,133,131,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
