Its founder, percussionist James Mtume, previously played with Miles Davis in the 1970s. Other members of the group included Reggie Lucas and Tawatha Agee.\n\nThey will always be remembered for such its as YOU, ME and HE, JUICYFRUIT, BREATHLESS to name a few. Like other great groups of the time like the SOS BAND, Atlantic Starr, Starpoint etc MTUME looked to keep R&amp;B alive and going well. Sadly like all good artist and groups, the record industry pushed good groups and artists aside for so called &quot;NEW&quot; music, which was more bland and without clear category.\n\nSo today I add this torrent to the pot to keep good music alive. And I want you to do your part in keeping it alive by continuing to SEED\n\nThank you in advance and ENJOY THE MUSIC\n\nThese are the albums included in this torrent\n\n\nKiss This World Goodbye (1978)\nIn Search of the Rainbow Seekers (1980)\nJuicy Fruit (1982)\nYou, Me and He (1984)\nTheater of the Mind (1986)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6142067fb140e9d947890b0c7878c22237d87842","amp;dn":"MTUME+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6142067fb140e9d947890b0c7878c22237d87842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,66,6,127,177,64,233,217,71,137,11,12,120,120,194,34,55,216,120,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
