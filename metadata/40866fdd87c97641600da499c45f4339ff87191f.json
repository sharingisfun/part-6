Among their biggest hits were &quot;Always&quot;,&quot;Secret Lovers&quot;, When Love Calls, &quot;Send for Me&quot; &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Love Me Down to name a few.\n\nThis was a time of REAL MUSIC and REAL SINGING where musical groups were competing for the best sound, best singing, most original work. i certainly miss those days as today's so called artist can't sing the alphabets let alone add emotion, feeling, presence to a song.\n\nI hope all of you enjoy this group as much as I did and do. I am posting these torrents in hopes of keeping REAL MUSIC ALIVE...your part is to keep seeding them so they do not die. Just maybe people will once again DEMAND REAL MUSIC like this group produced and we can then say good by to these record company creations like we see today who are more FLUFF than SUBSTANCE\n\nENJOY AND SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40866fdd87c97641600da499c45f4339ff87191f","amp;dn":"ATLANTIC+STARR+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40866fdd87c97641600da499c45f4339ff87191f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,134,111,221,135,201,118,65,96,13,164,153,196,95,67,57,255,135,25,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
