All the bandmembers reconvened in Australia to make Moment Bends, and it is hard not to think that this is a large part of why they sound much more focused than they did before.  Moment Bends shows Architecture in Helsinki moving forward by looking back - not only to their own skills with hooks and melodies, but to 80s synth pop too.\n\nReleased: May 3rd, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Electronic, Indie Pop, Alternative\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks: \n\n  1.
