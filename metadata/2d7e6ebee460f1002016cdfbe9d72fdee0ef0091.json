With a future-dripping user interface, 21 incredible filter types with the famous vowel mode. With distortions that cover your tracks with gas and put them on fire. Modulations that cause more trouble than your modular dark room. And finally that warm and juicy sound, that you were looking for.\n\n21 Filter types like Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass, Bandreject, Comb and much more. Low pass types up to 48 db, including flavors like SVF, Diode Ladder and Transistor Ladder.\nThe filters and distortions have been designed for best harmonics without aliasing, for high definition audio quality.\n\nThree different analog modeling overdrives and four digital distortion functions are included. Use them pre or post the filter.\n\nModulation is power. Power is sex. Create stunning trance gates with the step sequencer, do some giant wobbles with the wobble generator or let all the modulators interact with each other. The LFO offers many different wave forms, restart options and sync flavors. \n\nPresets are just one click away. Randomize presets to inspire yourself.   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nOur greets go to all hard working groups. \nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort. \n\nSupport the good developer if you like it. \nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand \nwhat you are doing and what it means. \n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n1337x.to - demonoid.ph - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMMXV (01)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7e6ebee460f1002016cdfbe9d72fdee0ef0091","amp;dn":"Sugar+Bytes+-+WOW2+v2.1.3+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7e6ebee460f1002016cdfbe9d72fdee0ef0091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,126,110,190,228,96,241,0,32,22,205,251,233,215,47,222,224,239,0,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
