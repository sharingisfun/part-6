It's seriously just an awesome listen straight through, all 70 minutes of it. For reasons unknown, the Sheep never really got recognition for there amazing beats and rhymes. They were members of the Native Tongues crew, along with The Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. Those groups are all better known than the Sheep, but they're certainly not any better. This cd has tracks with smooth beats commensurate to Tribe's best tracks on Midnight Marauders (Butt In The Meantime, Strobelite Honey), hilarious rhymes on point with De La's 3 Feet High and Rising (Pass The 40), and straight up great hip-hop tracks (Similak Child, Black With N.V. and Blunted 10), as anything from The Jungle Brother's Straight Out The Jungle. This is really a great album. I recommend it to everyone.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Black Sheep - A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Black Sheep\nAlbum................: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 223kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
