Posing as a holy man, the wily Tartuffe entrances Orgon, a credulous well-to-do merchant, bent on bestowing his worldly goods, social position, and nubile daughter on the perfidious fraud. Tartuffe delights in accepting it all--and also arranges a little depraved dalliance with Orgon's young wife, Elmire.&quot;\n\nmy notes:\n\nfrom IMDb:\n\n&quot;Who was Moliere? He is known everywhere as one of the world's greatest playwrights. But who was he? Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in 1622, the son of a prosperous tapestry maker. His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. &quot;  from a summary of a documentary on Moliere 1978.\n\n   There are a number of productions of this play by Moliere on dvd.  This is the best one.  What surprised me and makes the production memorable is that the first time you see Tartuffe he may remind you of a 1980's rock star.  I won't give it away, you be the judge.\n\n   For Moliere fans, the film &quot;Moliere&quot; released in 2007 is great to look at and uses an interesting take on the playwright and the plays:  It puts Moliere as a young formative playwright into situations which would become his later work.  See IMDb  /tt0796335/  It is available at TPB as .avi format.  Encourage your libraries to get this since is still current.\n\nNotes written June 27th , 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844c129bd057083faa124604c0e749e7e4a0cc02","amp;dn":"Tartuffe+%281985%29+produced+by+the+Royal+Shakespeare+Company+starri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844c129bd057083faa124604c0e749e7e4a0cc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,76,18,155,208,87,8,63,170,18,70,4,192,231,73,231,228,160,204,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
