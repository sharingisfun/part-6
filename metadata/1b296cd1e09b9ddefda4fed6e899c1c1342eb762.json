One of our greatest American artists, he redefined what materials were suitable for art, boldly rebelling against the predominant abstract expressionism of the time. This insightful analysis into Rauschenberg's work and life examines his bravery in pushing beyond technical and aesthetic frontiers as well as his influential dissemination of photography, film, and television, which altered the genre of traditional painting.\n\nRauschenberg's seminal worksÃ¢â‚¬â€ from his &quot;combines&quot; (urban trash on painted surfaces) to his silk screensÃ¢â‚¬â€ are reproduced here in full color. The author also discusses some of the artist's more recent projects, including ROCI, Rauschenberg's own exhibition organization that showcases diverse artists from all over the world.\n\nThrough beautiful photography and authoritative text, here is a well-rounded overview of one of the world's most pivotal artists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b296cd1e09b9ddefda4fed6e899c1c1342eb762","amp;dn":"Robert+Rauschenberg+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b296cd1e09b9ddefda4fed6e899c1c1342eb762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,41,108,209,224,155,157,222,253,164,254,214,232,153,193,193,52,46,183,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
