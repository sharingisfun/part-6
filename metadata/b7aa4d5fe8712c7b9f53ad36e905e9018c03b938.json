DeSpell) for Set 5.\n\nI'm not sure if I can find the patience to do any of the\nlonger stories such as Rug Riders or Luck of the North.\n\nMaybe a group scanlating project?\nI can upload an organized un-scanlated italian and \ngerman DD comics, if anybody's interested.\nI'm hoping that more recent english scans show\nup though.\n\nThe US german one pagers (7 of them) will be \nscanlated and included in Set 12.\n\nIf I get any longer stories scanlated, then\nI will include them in the final CBDA complete set gigatorrent\n\nSet 11:\n\na.
