Partly inspired by George Cukor\\'s 1939 classic The Women, 8 Femmes stars Catherine Deneuve as Gaby, a high-society matron just returned to her country house to celebrate Christmas with her husband; mother Mamy (Danielle Darrieux); sister Augustine (Isabelle Huppert); and daughters Suzon (Virginie Ledoyen) and Catharine (Ludivine Sagnier). Not long after they all arrive, however, do they find the man of the house with a knife in his back, whereupon everyone becomes a suspect -- including maids Chanel (Firmine Richard) and Louise (Emmanuelle BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©art). The mysterious arrival of Augustine\\'s sister-in-law Pierrette (Fanny Ardant) only complicates matters, as the titular eight women find themselves snowed in by a fierce blizzard, forced to confront the matter of the lifeless husband -- and their long-standing secrets and resentments -- without the aid of the police. Following its immensely successful release in France in early 2002, 8 Women enjoyed much acclaim at the Berlin and Toronto Film Festivals.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283832/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283832/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1503&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1503&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298ba5b9a7fe8fd457c42dd6b28c21541c71cebd","amp;dn":"8+Women+%282002%29+Fr+%28Engsubs%29+Fran%26Atilde%3B%26sect%3Bois+Ozon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298ba5b9a7fe8fd457c42dd6b28c21541c71cebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,139,165,185,167,254,143,212,87,196,45,214,178,140,33,84,28,113,206,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
