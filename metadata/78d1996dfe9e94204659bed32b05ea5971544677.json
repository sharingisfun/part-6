As the hauntingly beautiful old city of Saigon fades into the shadows of neon lights, Coca Cola signs, plastic lotus flowers and other symbols of Western invasion, these character's paths begin to cross.\nStories merge to paint a portrait of a country in transition, the last moments of a culture which, through a second invasion by its former enemy, will never be the same again: Kien An (Ngoc Hiep Nguyen) is a living memory of the old ways living life seemingly unchanged by the passage of time; Lan (Diep Bui) has reinvented herself as someone who can survive in the cold-hearted capitalist world; Hai (Don Doung) bridges the two worlds on his cyclo; James Hager (Harvey Keitel) is a reminder of the country's ravaged past; and young Woody is a symbol of its future. \n========================================\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
