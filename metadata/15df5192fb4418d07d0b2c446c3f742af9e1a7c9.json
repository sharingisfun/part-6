He did away with the left-hand striding that had been considered essential earlier and used his left hand to state chords on an irregular basis. His right often played speedy single-note lines, essentially transforming Charlie Parker's vocabulary to the piano (although he developed parallel to &quot;Bird&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15df5192fb4418d07d0b2c446c3f742af9e1a7c9","amp;dn":"Bud+Powell+-+The+Amazing+Bud+Powell+Vol+2+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15df5192fb4418d07d0b2c446c3f742af9e1a7c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,223,81,146,251,68,24,208,125,11,44,68,108,63,116,42,249,225,167,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
