Accurate and valid nursing diagnoses guide the selection of interventions that are likely to produce the desired treatment effects and determine nurse-sensitive outcomes.\nNursing diagnoses are seen as key to the future of evidence-based, professionally-led nursing care Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to more effectively meeting the need of patients. In an era of increasing electronic patient health records, standardized nursing terminologies such as NANDA-I, NIC and NOC provide a means of collecting nursing data that are systematically analysed within and across healthcare organizations and provide essential data for cost/benefit analysis and clinical audit.\n\nNursing Diagnoses: Definitions and Classification is the definitive guide to nursing diagnoses, as reviewed and approved by NANDA-I. Each nursing diagnosis undergoes a rigorous assessment process by NANDA-I's Diagnosis Development Committee, with stringent criteria used to indicate the strength of the underlying level of evidence.\n\nEach diagnosis comprises a label or name for the diagnosis, a definition, defining characteristics, risk factors and/or related factors. Many diagnoses are further qualified by terms such as risk for, effective, ineffective, impaired, imbalanced, self-care deficit, readiness for, disturbed, decreased, etc.\n\nThe 2012-2014 edition is arranged by concept according to Taxonomy II domains, i.e. Health promotion, Nutrition, Elimination and exchange, Activity/Rest, Perception/Cognition, Self-perception, Role relationships, Sexuality, Coping/ Stress tolerance, Life principles, Safety/protection, Comfort, and Growth/development.\n\nThe 2012-2014 edition contains revised chapters on NANDA-I taxonomy, and slotting of diagnoses into NANDA &amp; NNN taxonomies, diagnostic reasoning &amp; conceptual clarity, and submission of new/revised diagnoses. New chapters are provided on the use of nursing diagnoses in education, clinical practice, electronic health records, nursing &amp; health care administration, and research .
