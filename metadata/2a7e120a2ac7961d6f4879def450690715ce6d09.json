All included airports and schedules are in the FSX-format. The majority of the included aircraft types is already in the new, highly optimized FSX Service Pack 2 format, pairing top optical quality with ultimate performance.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * 4,7000,000+ weekly AI Flights - MyTraffic X includes over 4,700,000 (yes, that&amp;#039;s correct - more than four million) AI flights per week between 8,100 airports in all regions of the world. These flights include international, national, regional, commuter, general aviation, cargo, amphibian airlines, military and touch and go circuits.\n\n    * Flights are generated based on real world data and on a realistic model - All traffic is generated based on real-life traffic patterns. You will see airlines at airports and hubs which are consistent with their real-world operations. MyTraffic X also includes a set of long range flights based on published airline schedules giving you a high level of realism without the boring uniformity of products that restrict themselves solely to published schedules.\n\n    * 8,100+ Airports bustling with AI Traffic - MyTraffic X flies AI Traffic between more than 8,100 airports in all corners of the world. The AI capabilities of 1800 airports are enhanced in this package, including airline to gate associations for many airports. All aircraft behave realistically during different phases of their flight. Parking positions are also assigned in an accurate manner. For example, airliners will taxi to their gates, cargo aircraft will park at cargo positions situated near the respective airport cargo facilities. AI Traffic will behave in the same way even at add-on sceneries, provided that they are fully FSX compatible.\n       \n    *  Touch and Go flights into more than 100 small airfields.\n       \n    * Airliner, General Aviation and Military Traffic - With MyTraffic X you get yourself the only AI Traffic generator that treats all three types of aviation traffic with the same priority. And not only for current schedules; even going back in history to the beginning of the jet age is possible for owners of FSX professional edition.\n       \n    * 4300+ Liveries - MyTraffic X includes well over 4300 aircraft liveries and this number will keep growing, coming from more than 1800 different airlines (among them military units located at their home bases).\n       \n    * * 166+ Aircraft Models - From Airbus over Boeing to Yakolevs and Cessnas to Embraers, MyTraffic includes them all. All models are created with GMAX optimized for high frame rates even at very busy airports. Most of these aircrafts have been overworked in GMAX specially for FSX, to remove display errors as well as to increase performance beyond the one offered by Microsoft stock planes. Bringing realistic AI traffic to all parts of the world, MyTraffic can be oftenly observed to provide better performance even with more aircrafts around you than FSX stock AI traffic. 113 aircrafts with more than 3500 paints already are created from scratch in the new format introduced with Flight Simulator X Service Pack 2.\n       \n    * Full Support for Windows Vista ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all components now are modified and tested to work under Windows Vista even with UAC switched on. If a user wants to make changes to a setting under Vista, he only needs the rights to do so set in the file system.\n       \n    *\n\n      High level Support for the DX10 Preview introduced with FSX SP2 and Acceleration Pack - MyTraffic X 5.1b comes with two sets of schedules, switching between these is a simple mouse click in the MyTraffic Communicator. The Direct X 9 schedules use all aircraft models and paints, while the Direct X 10 schedules are restricted to the FSX SP2 compatible types only. Since these count all Western airliners and all larger Western commuters now, you will meet a larger variety of DX10 compatible airliners in MyTraffic X 5.2 world wide as you ever saw in any other legacy AI package, or has been promised by anybody else. DX10 support for military aircraft and historic schedules is not yet included, but some derivatives of airliners like the KC135 or the E3 are DX10 code already now.\n       \n    *\n\n      Simplicity is the key - MyTraffic X is simple by virtue. We do not overload our add-on with an unnecessary array of features, menus and other distractions. It is our philosophy to keep MyTraffic X as simple to use, yet as powerful as possible!\n       \n    *\n\n      MyTraffic X Editor*  - is an advanced AI Traffic configuration utility allowing the generation of thousands of flight plans at the click of a button, all based on user adjustable parameters. Capable of recognizing geographic regions, country borders, and the history of airline fleets, the editor makes sure that you see the right traffic in the right region.\n      * This feature requires that you have the SDK of Flight Simulator X installed, available to users of Flight Simulator X professional (Deluxe) edition.\n       \n    *\n\n      MyTraffic Communicator -  is a tool to support the user to get to information, to support, to make settings in their FSX and MyTraffic setups, to repair installations that got broken, and to download updates and patches.
