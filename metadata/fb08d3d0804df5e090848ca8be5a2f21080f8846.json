It features a WAAS-certified GPS, 2280-channel capacity comm and 200-channel ILS/VOR with localizer and glideslope. Traditionally it would take a host of components to provide the capabilities of this one smart box. High-speed 5 Hz processing makes navigation calculations and map redraw rates five times faster than earlier GNS series navigators.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Wx500?\n\nThe Wx500 is the industry-leading weather radar simulation for Flight Simulator. For the first time a true weather radar is available for Flight Simulator. The new technology proved to reliably detect the clouds and water bodies position and actually distinguish between the several types.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll files where downloaded on 06/06/2010.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nFollow me on twitter: @DCrackNews\n\nDCrack\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb08d3d0804df5e090848ca8be5a2f21080f8846","amp;dn":"Reality+XP+WX500+and+GNS+WAAS+for+FSX+by+DCrack+--+NEW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb08d3d0804df5e090848ca8be5a2f21080f8846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,8,211,208,128,77,245,224,144,132,140,168,190,90,47,33,8,15,136,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
