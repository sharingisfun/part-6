He had the genius to conjure up improbable rhyming lyrics to catchy melodies delivering not only a single song but as often or not a whole conundrum of numbers collected within the sphere of a show. This collection of 40 songs exemplifies the talent of Cole Porter and is a testament (tribute) to his longevity in musical history. Wit, humour, sophistication, rhythmic and key changes are small change to his ability.Who else could win a challenge to produce 'Miss Otis Regrets' after questioned whether he could write lyrics from the next words he heard? The cast of star celebrities in this collection say it all. Sinatra, Bennett,Crosby, Ella, Billie,Nat,Marlene, Judy to name a few. Also, the bigger bands of not so long ago, Nat Gonella, Jack Hylton, Geraldo. These need preservation orders and what better than endorse the master composer Mr Cole Porter? Add this to your collection.\nAmazon Review By ACB(swansea)\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] I've Got You Under My Skin - - -  Frank Sinatra\n[02] I Get A Kick Out Of You - - -  Ethel Merman, Johnny Green Orchestra\n[03] Anything Goes - - -  Tony Bennett\n[04] You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To - - -  Bing Crosby\n[05] My Heart Belongs To Daddy - - -  Ella Fitzgerald\n[06] Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love) - - -  Billie Holiday\n[07] You Do Something To Me - - -  Frank Sinatra\n[08] True Love - - -  Nat King Cole\n[09] Just One Of Those Things - - -  Frank Sinatra\n[10] You Do Something To Me - - -  Marlene Dietrich\n[11] Miss Otis Regrets - - -  The Mills Brothers\n[12] Love Of My Life - - -  Judy Garland\n[13] Rosalie - - -  Nelson Eddy\n[14] At Long Last Love - - -  Frank Sinatra\n[15] How Could We Be Wrong - - -  Al Bowlly, Lew Stone &amp; His Band\n[16] I'm A Gigolo - - -  Cole Porter\n[17] They All Fall In Love - - -  Jack Hylton Orchestra (Pat O'Malley)\n[18] Love For Sale - - -  Libby Holman, Brunswick Studio Orchestra\n[19] All Through The Night - - -  Ambrose and His Orchestra, Sam Browne\n[20] Don't Fence Me In - - -  Frankie Laine\n\nPlay Time - 00h:53m:37s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] So Easy To Love - - -  Vic Damone\n[02] I Love You - - -  Bing Crosby\n[03] Night And Day - - -  Billie Holiday\n[04] Begin The Beguine - - -  Frank Sinatra\n[05] At Long Last Love - - -  Lena Horne\n[06] You're The Top - - -  Ethel Merman\n[07] Thank You So Much, Mrs. Lowsborough, Goodby - - -  Cole Porter\n[08] Blow Gabriel Blow - - -  Nat Gonella &amp; His Orchestra\n[09] Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love - - -  Jack Hylton &amp; Orchestra Vocal June Malo\n[10] The Banjo (That Man Joe Play) - - -  Jack Hylton Orchestra\n[11] Who Knows - - -  Sam Browne\n[12] Goodbye Little Dream, Goodbye - - -  Jack Hylton &amp; Orchestre Vocal Bert Yarlett\n[13] In The Still Of The Night - - -  Victor Silvester &amp; His Ballroom Orchestra\n[14] I've Got My Eyes On You - - -  Geraldo Orchestra\n[15] Swingin' The Jinx Away - - -  Nat Gonella\n[16] It's Bad For Me - - -  Al Bowlly\n[17] It's D'lovely - - -  Carroll Gibbons And Savoy Hotel Orphean\n[18] I'm In Love Again - - -  Jack Hylton\n[19] Experiment - - -  Al Bowlly\n[20] Hey Goodlookin'  - - -  Geraldo &amp; Orchestra Vocal Doreen Villiers\n\nPlay Time - 00h:58m:04s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:41m:41s\nTotal File Size....................... 262mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
