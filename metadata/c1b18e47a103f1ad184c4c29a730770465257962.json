In The Ego Tunnel, philosopher Thomas Metzinger claims otherwise: No such thing as a self exists. The conscious self is the content of a model created by our brainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an internal image, but one we cannot experience as an image. Everything we experience is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa virtual self in a virtual reality.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b18e47a103f1ad184c4c29a730770465257962","amp;dn":"The+Ego+Tunnel%3A+The+Science+of+the+Mind+and+the+Myth+of+the+Self","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b18e47a103f1ad184c4c29a730770465257962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,177,142,71,161,3,241,173,24,76,76,41,167,48,119,4,101,37,121,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
