Fearing his father may be stranded in timeÃ¢â‚¬â€or worseÃ¢â‚¬â€Shel enlists the aid of Dave Dryden, a linguist, to accompany him on the rescue mission.\n\nTheir journey through history takes them from the enlightenment of Renaissance Italy through the American Wild West to the civil-rights upheavals of the 20th century. Along the way, they encounter a diverse cast of historical greats, sometimes in unexpected situations. Yet the elder Shelborne remains elusive.\n\nAnd then Shel violates his agreement with Dave not to visit the future. There he makes a devastating discovery that sends him fleeing back through the ages, and changes his life forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ecb9d2965b458e6fdcb19f6c0ccb2ba28e34fe","amp;dn":"Time+Travelers+Never+Die+by+Jack+McDevitt+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ecb9d2965b458e6fdcb19f6c0ccb2ba28e34fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,236,185,210,150,91,69,142,111,220,177,159,108,12,203,43,162,142,52,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
