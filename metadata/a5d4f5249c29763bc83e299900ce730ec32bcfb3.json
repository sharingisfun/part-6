For disillusioned writer and itinerant barnstormer Richard Bach, belief is as real as a full tank of gas and sparks firing in the cylinders...until he meets Donald Shimoda--former mechanic and self-described messiah who can make wrenches fly and Richard's imagination soar....\n\nIn Illusions, the unforgettable follow-up to his phenomenal bestseller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach takes to the air to discover the ageless truths that give our souls wings: that people don't need airplanes to soar...that even the darkest clouds have meaning once we lift ourselves above them... and that messiahs can be found in the unlikeliest places--like hay fields, one-traffic-light midwestern towns, and most of all, deep within ourselves.\n\n-----------------------\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d4f5249c29763bc83e299900ce730ec32bcfb3","amp;dn":"Illusions+-+by+Richard+Bach+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d4f5249c29763bc83e299900ce730ec32bcfb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,212,245,36,156,41,118,59,200,62,41,153,0,206,115,14,195,43,207,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
