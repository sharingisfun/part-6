He died in a car accident in 1997 in Recife, Pernambuco, at the age of 30. He became the lead singer and major creative driving force of the groundbreaking Mangue Bit band called Chico Science &amp; NaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Zumbi (CSNZ). Influenced by such musicians as James Brown, Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow, their music cleverly fused rock, funk, and hip hop with maracatu and other traditional rhythms of Brazil's Northeast. Chico had a powerful stage presence that was compared by some to that of Jimi Hendrix.\n\n1994: Da lama ao caos\n1996: Afrociberdelia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d7e46ad393ff8e3ab67610619459cf7343b365","amp;dn":"Chico+Science+and+Nacao+Zumbi+2+CDs+Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d7e46ad393ff8e3ab67610619459cf7343b365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,215,228,106,211,147,255,142,58,182,118,16,97,148,89,207,115,67,179,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
