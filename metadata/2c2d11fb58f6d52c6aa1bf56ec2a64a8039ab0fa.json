A third of us now spend a total of over 1.6 billion a year on superstitious alternative remedies, but 80% of them have never been subjected to properly conducted trials.\n\nSlaves to Superstition: Prof Richard Dawkins tackles the epidemic of irrational, superstitious thinking which is blotting the light of logic and evidence. After garnering tips on psychics' entirely earthly trade secrets from the illusionist Derren Brown, Dawkins attends a seance and confronts the medium. Time and again, the interviewees appeal to personal revelation or second-hand anecdote to justify their belief.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2d11fb58f6d52c6aa1bf56ec2a64a8039ab0fa","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins+-+Enemies+of+Reason+-+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2d11fb58f6d52c6aa1bf56ec2a64a8039ab0fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,45,17,251,88,246,213,44,106,161,191,86,236,42,100,168,3,154,176,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
