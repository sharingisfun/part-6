Long was a lifelong devotee of the King James Version, but when he shared it with his friends he was distressed to find that it just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t connect. Long saw the need for a translation that captured the truths he loved in the language that his contemporaries spoke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:421a78280796c5d6c32cf4934ce58fda53cf7310","amp;dn":"New+International+Version+bible+-+NIV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"421a78280796c5d6c32cf4934ce58fda53cf7310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,26,120,40,7,150,197,214,195,44,244,147,76,229,143,218,83,207,115,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
