Basically the creator took the original Star Wars Episode 1 Phantom Menace, and re-edited the whole thing making it much more like the older Star Wars movies and attempted to make a much better movie by re-editing the whole thing.\n\nRead more about the Phantom Edit at Wikipedia:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nI only saw a huge 4+GB files for each of the movies here, so I went and grabbed the TS source files, and removed the Title Screen and Extras.\nI compressed the files using DVD Shrink, at 42% quality of the original. However, 42% sounds like a lot but is practically unnoticeable. Really all it does it make the file faster to download and frees up your hard drive for other movies! =)\nLastly I turned the TS into a playable and burnable .ISO file.\n\nPlay with VLC Media Player (FREE) by opening VLC and dragging the ISO file straight into VLC and it will play the movie.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nAlternatively, you can burn it to a DVD using ImgBurn (FREE).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nPlease remember to seed and say thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a66a7cb67c81751db055684d23453da4b125ae7","amp;dn":"-XBT-+Star+Wars+Episode+1+-+The+Phantom+Edit+-+Compressed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a66a7cb67c81751db055684d23453da4b125ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,102,167,203,103,200,23,81,219,5,86,132,210,52,83,218,75,18,90,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
