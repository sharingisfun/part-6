Note we do default to the A321 CFM cockpit for all models (that is is also flown with N1 displays btw). \nTwenty-one liveries, extensive paint kit. Over 100 additional liveries available on release. \nSublime modeling/texturing based on the latest technologies. Very easy on frame-rates. \nLanding lights, taxi lights, taxiway turn-off lights created with the best technology which actually lights objects up. \nDozens of non-standard animations, all with sound effects (sun screens, windows,  tables, tiller, jump seat, standby compass, drooping flight surfaces etc). \nIncluded web server that allows you to access (and use) the MCDU via any web browser; ideal for tablet computers. \nAutomated State Save that saves (and loads) all the aircraft systems when the standard FSX save (load) option is used. \nExtensive options to show ground objects (cones, ground power etc) and to actually provide ground power. \nAll main doors and cargo hatches can be opened. \nMany systems programmed in XML to allows users to change code. \nExtensive manuals, with highly detailed step-by-step section in (at least) 12 languages. \nPrepared for Airport Enhancement Services. Fully compatible with GSX. \nSDK will be available, LINDA connectivity available. \nAdd-in system that allows the aircraft to be extended with 3rd party applications (all using the right MCDU). \nAdd-in View system: adds many pre-defined views for easy use, emulates 2D panel views. \nAdd-in Sound system: adds hundreds of background sounds to enhance the immersion. \nAdd-in Checklist system: semi-automated audio checklists. Checklist has two options, callouts only, or callouts with semi-automation (think virtual co-pilot). \nWe opened part of the support sections already so the FAQ section could assist in answering some of the frequently asked questions: http://forum.aerosoft.com/index.php?/forum/518-faq/ \nFully tested under Windows 8.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315f026ed4718f3186e2660be75f1cb6f5e0e45c","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Aerosoft+-+Airbus+X+Extended+%5BRIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315f026ed4718f3186e2660be75f1cb6f5e0e45c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,95,2,110,212,113,143,49,134,226,102,11,231,95,28,182,245,224,228,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
