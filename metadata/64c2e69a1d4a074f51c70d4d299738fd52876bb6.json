This double-disc set encompasses her entire career, and though the lion's share of the material may come from RCA (where she spent the longest part of her career), it includes recordings from every label she recorded for, including Bethlehem, Colpix, Philips, CTI, and Elektra. There are 31 tracks in all, and virtually every one is essential Simone. She was virtually limitless in her abilities to cover almost any genre in her way, and while there are other collections that address different parts of Simone's career more completely, this is the only one most fans and curiosity seekers will ever need. \n\n\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.I Loves You, Porgy\n02.My Baby Just Cares For Me\n03.The Other Woman\n04.Black Is The Color Of My True Love's Hair\n05.Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\n06.Trouble In Mind\n07.Mississippi Goddam\n08.See Line Woman\n09.Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\n10.I Put A Spell On You\n11.Ne Me Quitte Pas\n12.Strange Fruit\n13.Four Women\n14.Sinner Man\n15.Do I Move You\n\nCD2\n\n01.I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl\n02.I Wish I Knew How It Felt To Be Free\n03.The Glory Of Love\n04.To Love Somebody\n05.Do What You Gotta Do\n06.Ain't Got No - I Got Life\n07.Why (The King Of Love Is Dead)\n08.Everyone's Gone To The Moon\n09.Revolution\n10.To Be Young, Gifted And Black\n11.Who Knows Where Time Goes\n12.Here Comes The Sun\n13.Just Like A Woman\n14.Funkier Than A Mosquito's Tweeter\n14.Take Me To The Water\n15.Rich Girl\n15.Work Song\n16.A Single Woman\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c2e69a1d4a074f51c70d4d299738fd52876bb6","amp;dn":"Nina+Simone+-+Anthology+%282003%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c2e69a1d4a074f51c70d4d299738fd52876bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,194,230,154,29,74,7,79,81,199,13,77,41,151,56,253,82,135,107,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
