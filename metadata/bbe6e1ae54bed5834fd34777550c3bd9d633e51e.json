The word tenhi is an old Finnish word meaning a village elder, wise old man or seer.\n\nThe music of Tenhi is minimalistic and dark. Usually, the rhythm instrument lines follow the customs of modern rock music. The melodical instruments and vocals are however very heavily folk-influenced. The basic instrumentarium of the band consists of acoustic guitar, bass and drums. Frequent additional instruments include piano, violin, viola and flute and less frequent didgeridoo, mouth harp, harmonium, cello, udu and synthesizer.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe6e1ae54bed5834fd34777550c3bd9d633e51e","amp;dn":"Tenhi+-+7+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe6e1ae54bed5834fd34777550c3bd9d633e51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,230,225,174,84,190,213,131,79,211,71,119,85,12,59,217,214,51,229,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
