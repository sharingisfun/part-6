A member of a band of pirates nominally allied with the Germans in the South Pacific in 1913, Corto becomes interested in the welfare of two kidnapped British children. As the shifting interests of governments at war half a world away begin to make themselves known at their well-hidden pirate base, he must find a way to keep the children safe and himself alive.\n\nHugo Pratt's linework at this stage hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t yet evolved into the totally minimalist line of his later works and this is a perfect place to start for those who want to discover one of comics great adventure strips.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69aa9eeb03db3a94c29d3f01aa4ea122f7266973","amp;dn":"Corto+Maltese+-+Ballad+of+the+Salt+Sea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69aa9eeb03db3a94c29d3f01aa4ea122f7266973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,170,158,235,3,219,58,148,194,157,63,1,170,78,161,34,247,38,105,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
