What if the stage became a fantastic world where the old were young again, and where the kings were clowns? And if that were ALEGRÃƒÂ­A, what would you make of it all? Wherever ALEGRÃƒÂ­A has passed, its refrain of folly and irreverent laughter echo still. Its magic and joy spring from a world turned upside down.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8497519487c04ac9438e9fa824d738063599bb","amp;dn":"Cirque+du+Soleil%2C+Alegr%C3%ADa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8497519487c04ac9438e9fa824d738063599bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,132,151,81,148,135,192,74,201,67,142,159,168,36,215,56,6,53,153,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
