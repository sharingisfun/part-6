Western starring Richard Widmark and directed by Delmer Daves.\n\nIf you've seen A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies - and if you haven't, try and rectify that immediately - you may remember that the GoodFellas director was keen to champion such underrated talents as Sam Fuller, Ida Lupino and Delmer Daves. The man behind The Last Wagon, Daves made a number of notable films in a wide variety of genres. Demetrius And The Gladiators, 3:10 To Yuma, Dark Passage - it didn't matter whether it was noir mystery, a horse opera or a sword and sandal epic, all could benefit from Daves' efficient direction. With films like Yuma, Cowboy and Broken Arrow on his CV, it's hardly surprising that Daves is so readily associated with westerns. Of the oaters he made, The Last Wagon stands out from the crowd courtesy of its concerns with politics and racial identity and an excellent leading turn from Richard Widmark.\n\nWidmark stars as Comanche Todd, a white man who has thrown in his lot with the native tribe having fallen foul of the white man's law. As rugged as the landscape he inhabits, Todd becomes the last hope of a wagon train that has fallen prey to the Apache. For only a man with Todd's grasp of tribal politics and understanding of the terrain can prevent the pioneers experiencing further misfortune. Made the same year as his superb thriller The Red House, The Last Wagon is right up there with the pick of Daves' pictures. At a time when most directors - John Ford included - preferred to portray the red man as unsophisticated savages only capable of speaking in halting English, Daves and his co-writers dared to show the tribes as complex social groups governed by a political system as intricate as the societal laws that governed the settlers. To this most noble of ends, Daves was greatly helped by Richard Widmark, whose turn as Comanche Todd is up there with his remarkable performance as Tommy Udo in the original Kiss Of Death. A man so tough he looked like he was permanently constipated, Widmark was brilliant at playing a bruiser. But as he proves in The Last Wagon, there was often a twinkle behind the snake-slit eyes, and it's this that makes both Todd and Daves' picture so memorable.\n \nThe mounting menace of Indian attack as the survivors of a wagon train massacre make their way through hostile Apache country provides stirring motivation for this excellent production. Its suspenseful plot and rugged characterization by Richard Widmark as a Comanche-reared white man are admirably backdropped by the magnificent Northern Arizona scenery. Under Delmer DavesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shrewd direction, film comes off as an interesting enterprise far off the beaten path of routine westerns.\nWidmark is seen in a forceful role, a man who killed to avenge the murder of his Comanche wife and two sons, and has none of the refinements of civilization until he meets Felicia Farr, who is one of the survivors\n \nHere's something you may not know,following James Dean's, death director George Stevens, Jr. brought NickAdams,who's in this western,in to dub Dean's voice in Giant.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 675mb\nDuration.... 01:35:03\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 704\nFrame Height.... 304\nData Rate.... 824kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 164kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e899bcaaadcb9ea6f1f8708e19df3428b4217c","amp;dn":"The+Last+Wagon+1956+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3e899bcaaadcb9ea6f1f8708e19df3428b4217c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,232,153,188,170,173,203,158,166,241,248,112,142,25,223,52,40,180,33,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
