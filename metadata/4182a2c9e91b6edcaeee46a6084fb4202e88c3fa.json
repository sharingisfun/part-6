Drawn into the insular, international network of chess, they must also navigate the difficult waters of their own relationship. All the while, Waitzkin wonders about and searches for the elusive Bobby Fischer, whose myth still dominates the chess world and profoundly affects Waitzkin's dreams for his son.\n\n\n\nNote: All chapter links work using Aldiko and Kindle on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) and Calibre and Kindle on a desktop PC.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4182a2c9e91b6edcaeee46a6084fb4202e88c3fa","amp;dn":"Searching+for+Bobby+Fischer+ebook+Fred+Waitzkin+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4182a2c9e91b6edcaeee46a6084fb4202e88c3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,130,162,201,233,27,110,220,174,238,70,166,8,79,180,32,46,136,195,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
