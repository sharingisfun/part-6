The 19th century gave us a wealth of artistic riches so memorable in their genius that we can picture many of them in an instant.

Professor Laurie Schneider Adams vividly brings to life the paintings, sculpture, photography and architecture, of the period with her infectious enthusiasm for art and detailed explorations of individual works. Offered fascinating biographical details and the relevant social, political, and cultural context, the reader is left with a deep appreciation for the works and an understanding of how revolutionary they were at the time, as well as the reasons for their enduring appeal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ca2e9e105cda8bc035056ffe02399e515c8478","amp;dn":"19th-Century+Art%3A+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+-+Laurie+Schneider+Adams++-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ca2e9e105cda8bc035056ffe02399e515c8478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,202,46,158,16,92,218,139,192,53,5,111,254,2,57,158,81,92,132,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
