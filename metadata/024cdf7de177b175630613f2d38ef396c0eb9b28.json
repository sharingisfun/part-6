This book is appropriate for future air traffic controllers, as well as for pilots who need a better understanding of the air traffic control system. FUNDAMENTALS OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL 5E discusses the history of air traffic control, emphasizing the logic that has guided its development. It also provides current, in-depth information on navigational systems, the air traffic control system structure, control tower procedures, radar separation, national airspace system operation and the FAA's restructured hiring procedures. This is the only college level book that gives readers a genuine understanding of the air traffic control system and does not simply require them to memorize lists of rules and regulations.\n\n# Hardcover: 654 pages\n# Publisher: Delmar Cengage Learning; 5 edition (January 28, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1435482727\n# ISBN-13: 978-1435482722","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024cdf7de177b175630613f2d38ef396c0eb9b28","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Air+Traffic+Control+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024cdf7de177b175630613f2d38ef396c0eb9b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,76,223,125,225,119,177,117,99,6,19,242,211,142,243,150,192,235,155,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
