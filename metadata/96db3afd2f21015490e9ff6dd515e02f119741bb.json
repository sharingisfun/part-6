I am NOT promising you won?t be offended. You may be. I am NOT promising you won?t vehemently disagree with things I say. You probably will. I am NOT promising you the most enjoyable seminar experience of your life. I doubt this is it.\n\nWhat I am promising is a very different kind of information that you will wind up agreeing is very important and worthy of a lot of continued thinking on your part. That the above nine statements are true and inarguable.\n\n\n&quot;My Name is Ryan Deiss, I'm an online marketer, and I also sell marketing materials to financial services niche... The Dan Kennedy product that has had the biggest impact on me and my business is the Wealth Attraction Seminar...&quot;\n\n\nClick to hear more\nHow The Seminar Was Structured\n\nDuring the first half of the day, we dealt with the philosophy, concepts, principles, the thinking and the emotions involved with money, wealth and success. Without confronting these, most practical, strategic advice is nearly valueless.\n\nDuring the second half of the day we switched to more practical, strategic things to do. Item #?s 29 and 30, for example, are alone worth far more than the price of admission. When talking about #29 and #30, I peel back the hide of all businesses and expose the vulnerable weakness, the ailment in most, that guarantees the owners cannot achieve both the monetary success and the lifestyle and peace of mind they would like. This is the flaw that forces people to trade one for the other.\n\nWhat - Exactly - Will You Hear?\n\nFollows is a list of the key points I discussed during the day, that you will find referenced in your Manual, and hear on the CD's, and I would urge you to take a slow, careful, thorough look at this list of 31 potentially life-changing items. There is some value to be had solely by studying the list! - even if you never go through the seminar. But beyond that, try thinking of this as a ?quiz? or ?test? of your own wealth attraction knowledge; ask yourself how many of these you are certain you know the answer to.\n\nWhat You Will Discover In THE WEALTH ATTRACTION FOR ENTREPRENEURS Seminar CD's/DVD\n\nTwelve Mental &amp; Emotional Positions That Enable And Empower Your Subconscious To Most Readily Attract Wealth\n\nHow To Liberate Yourself From THE Emotion That Stands Solidly In The Way Of The Attraction Of Wealth For More People Than Any Other Obstacle\n\nThe Fallacy Of ?Re-Distribution Of Wealth?, Explained By Andrew Carnegie\n\nConsidering The Separation Of Money From Morality and Understanding Why So Many Good, Decent, Hard-Working People Are Poor\n\nThe Seven Major Fears That Block Wealth Attraction\n\nHow You Were Programmed By ?What You Heard At The Top Of The Stairs?

For those who don?t follow the sport, there is a head coach (CEO) and two coordinators, one for offense (marketing), one for defense (accounting). The offensive coordinator controls the game while his team has possession of the ball and is attempting to move down the field to score points. Let us assume you are in severe disagreement with the head coach over the game plan. You disagree with his philosophy of coaching. You are unhappy with the players who?ve been selected to play on offense. He wants a ?run ?n shoot? type of offensive, you believe in ?3 yards ?n a cloud of dust.? But you must implement his game plan. How effective are you going to be?\n\nNot very.\n\nBut this is the exact position many entrepreneurs wind up with. Their subconscious system is actually in conflict with their conscious system. The conscious is making plans, setting goals, giving directives to a subconscious in severe discord. How effective is the subconscious going to be?\n\nMy friend, the late Jim Newman, author of a very good book you should read titled ?Release Your Brakes? talked about this in terms of driving down the road with one foot on the gas, the other riding the brake, and the emergency brake still on. I occasionally make this mistake. I rarely use my emergency brake, so when I do park on a hill and use it, I?ll forget to disengage it and be driving down the road wondering why the car seems so sluggish.\n\nDr. Maxwell Maltz, in ?Psycho-Cybernetics?, talked about in terms of our inability to out-perform our self-image. But not many authors or teachers ever make the direct link for you between this internal system conflict and the money part of your life.\n\nSo when I provide people with a ?marketing game plan? and powerful tools, and entrepreneurial skills and strategies, many of them wind up being the offensive coordinator emotionally unable to implement the head coach?s program.\n\nThat?s one of the reasons I decided to give this unusual seminar once, and get it on tape.\n\nThe other is the amazing potential that exists to lift someone?s income and financial success purely and solely by lifting certain barriers from their thinking. Frankly, you can?t do that with the stuff I usually teach - it requires people to do things, to implement, to alter the way they conduct business. But you can actually alter nothing but the way you think and feel about money and see some direct, almost immediate improvements in your financial reality. It is as close to authentic magic as anybody can get. It?s kind of a kick to wake people up to this and watch what happens. I?m already getting some mind-blowing reports from those who were at the seminar.\n\nRegrettably many of these letters cannot be published or shared, because they not only deal with money results but with other, profoundly personal matters. A man writing to me about coming to grips with his horrible childhood of poverty and abuse for the first time. Another about a dramatic realization about his self-sabotage. And so forth.\n\nAnyway, you can rest assured I haven?t gone soft on you. I?m very much into practical strategy and real, measurable results, into keeping score in dollars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96db3afd2f21015490e9ff6dd515e02f119741bb","amp;dn":"Dan+Kennedy+-+Wealth+Attraction+for+Entrepreneurs+Seminar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96db3afd2f21015490e9ff6dd515e02f119741bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,219,58,253,47,33,1,84,144,233,255,109,213,21,224,47,17,151,65,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
