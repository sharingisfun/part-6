There, his cunning brother in law (who happens to be a lawyer) convinces him to pretend that his legs have been paralyzed. This way, they can receive a huge indemnity from the insurance company. Of course, the insurance company's men suspect that the paralysis is a fake one, and so a big &quot;game&quot; begins. The first collaboration of the successful team of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.\n\n        Jack Lemmon\t... \tHarry Hinkle\n\n\tWalter Matthau\t... \tWillie Gingrich\n\tRon Rich\t... \tLuther 'Boom Boom' Jackson\n\tJudi West\t... \tSandy Hinkle\n\n\tCliff Osmond\t... \tPurkey\n\tLurene Tuttle\t... \tMother Hinkle\n\tHarry Holcombe\t... \tO'Brien\n\tLes Tremayne\t... \tThompson\n\tLauren Gilbert\t... \tKincaid\n\tMarge Redmond\t... \tCharlotte Gingrich\n\tNoam Pitlik\t... \tMax\n\tHarry Davis\t... \tDr. Krugman\n\tAnn Shoemaker\t... \tSister Veronica\n\tMaryesther Denver... \tNurse\n\tNed Glass\t... \tDoc Schindler\n\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name............
