But what real difference does this accolade make? His TV pilot has been cancelled, his mother still thinks the 1970s game show host Tom OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor is funnier than him, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been booked to perform stand-up for a conference of insect scientists for no money, while dressed as an aphid. Lucky for us, the more frustrating StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life becomes, the funnier he gets.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s LeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acclaimed show, 41st Best Stand-Up Ever, captured in extreme close-up at The Stand comedy club in Glasgow.
