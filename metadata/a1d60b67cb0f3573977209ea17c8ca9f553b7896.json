Expertly guided by the erudite Kevin McCloud, this series takes you on seven extra-ordinary builds...from the re-birthing of a dilapidated mill complex into a sustainable and dynamic dream home... the conversion of a crumbling boathouse on a pier... to the re-interpretation of a heritage listed barn into a contemporary museum-like home.\n\n\n1)  Tree House \nKevin McCloud follows the progress of architectural designer Lincoln Miles and his wife, artist Lisa Traxler, who want to create their own home on the Isle of Wight. They have bought a property on a prime piece of land and set out to convert it into a creative structure that harmonises with the unspoilt woodland setting.\n\n2)  Stealth House \nKevin follows the progress of two architects who are planning to build an eco-friendly subterranean house underneath a ruined 300-year-old barn in the Cotswolds. In one of the most challenging projects seen on the programme, Helen and Chris Seymour Smith build a steel frame around the barn while they excavate underneath, aiming to create a home that is airtight and needs no heating.\n\n3)  Modest Home \nKevin McCloud follows the efforts of Lucie Fairweather to build an eco-friendly house in Woodbridge, Suffolk. After the death of her partner 18 months earlier, and not having a large budget, Lucie is determined to create a beautiful and affordable family home with the help of Jerry Tate, an architect who was involved in the design of the Eden Project.\n\n4)  Barn and Guildhal \nKevin McCloud follows the progress of Simon and Jill Bennett as they try to restore two timber-framed barns in Suffolk. The couple found out that one of the buildings is among the smallest surviving medieval guildhalls in the country, and while Kevin advises them to conserve it in its present state, Simon is determined to restore it to its former glory.\n\n5)  Radian House \nKevin McCloud oversees the efforts of Jonathan Belsey, a scientist who is trying to build a carbon-neutral home for his partner and their combined family of four daughters in Boxford, Suffolk. The design and construction is risky because it features untested technology and an uncompromising choice of materials, and he soon finds the costs spiralling out of control.\n\n6)  Scandinavian House \nKevin McCloud follows interior designer Kathryn Tyler as she tries to create a Scandinavian-style eco house in her mother's back garden in Falmouth, Cornwall. The plan is ambitious, featuring a white-painted brick ground floor, a lightweight timber-frame first floor and cleverly designed spaces, but the small size of the plot and Kathryn's inexperience could hamper the project.\n\n7)  Adaptahaus \nKevin McCloud follows former blacksmith Alan Dawson, who has devised a way of building that should allow him to complete his home in just seven days. The method resembles that of a giant toy construction, with wiring, lighting, plumbing and carpets built into sections that are then taken to the site by lorry - but precision is critical if the house is to fit together.\n\n8)  Dome House \nKevin McCloud follows the progress of Robert and Milla Gaukroger, as they try to add three extensions to a 1980s property overlooking Lake Windermere in the Lake District. Robert has designed his own heating system to achieve maximum sustainability, but the project begins with only Ã‚Â£100,000 of the Ã‚Â£400,000 budget in place, and he and his family have to move into the existing building while work goes on around them.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e567779765e522d302e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1819 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 646 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Release Notes\n * Merged subtitles\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%20Season01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%20Season01&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%206&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%206&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%207&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%207&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%208&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Grand%20Designs%3A%20Collection%208&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d60b67cb0f3573977209ea17c8ca9f553b7896","amp;dn":"Ch4+Grand+Designs+Collection+9+6of8+The+Scandinavian+House+DVDRi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d60b67cb0f3573977209ea17c8ca9f553b7896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,214,11,103,203,15,53,115,151,114,9,234,23,200,202,159,85,59,120,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
