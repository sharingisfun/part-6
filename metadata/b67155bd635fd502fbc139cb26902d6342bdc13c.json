What would it be? For John Sullivan, there is no question. He\nwould undo the events of October 12, 1969, when the out-of-control Bruxton\nfire took the life of his father, a heroic firefighter. Ever since he was a\nkid, John dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day,\nwhich set into motion the anger and loneliness that have haunted his adult\nlife as a cop in the 1990s. Now John may get exactly what he has wished for,\nand more than he bargained for. One day before the anniversary of his\nfathers death, in the midst of the spectacular storm known as the aurora\nborealis, John Sullivan discovers in the house he inherited his fathers old\nham radio and begins to play with it. Through the electrical static, he\nfinds himself talking to a man who claims to be a firefighter and who\nappears to be awaiting the World Series of 1969. Is John really talking to\nhis own living father on the very same day, in the very same house, but\nexactly three decades ago? At first neither can believe it, but soon John\nis carrying on an all-night conversation with his young father, sharing\nfor the first time his deep love and regret over his future death. Yet\nJohn realizes that now he may be able to change all that. By alerting Frank\nto the mistake that cost him his life the first time around, John saves his\nyouthful father from dying in the Bruxton fire. On October 12, 1999, John\nSullivan discovers that he now has photographs on his walls of his father\nas a gray-haired man. By changing the past, the Sullivans have forged a new\npresent. John is ecstatic with his new memories of his father- until he\ndiscovers other things have been altered. Subtle changes caused by his\nfather's survival have led to a string of unsolved serial homicides,\nincluding the grisly murder of John's mother. Now Frank and John must race\nagainst the clock-divided by three decades and connected only by a\nradio-to prevent a murder that will seal their destinies. And each time\nFrank changes something in his universe, John wakes up to a whole new\nreality.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Dennis Quaid.\n=&gt;-Jim Caviezel.\n=&gt;-Shawn Doyle.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Gregory Hoblit.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Crime : Sci-Fi : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2000.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.54 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 883 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 58mn.\n=&gt;-Frequency..................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frequency/\n=&gt;-Frequency..................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frequency/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 217 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67155bd635fd502fbc139cb26902d6342bdc13c","amp;dn":"Frequency+-+Dennis+Quaid+Sci-fi+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67155bd635fd502fbc139cb26902d6342bdc13c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,113,85,189,99,95,213,2,251,193,57,203,38,144,45,99,66,189,193,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
