The signal has been compressed in such a way, that the average level is louder than on the Capitol CD's, although the peaks are not. Especially the low frequencies have been boosted, resulting in a somewhat muddy sound and a less focused midrange. This has also affected the stereo image. To me, the Capitol CDs are sonically superior and closer to the original LPs.\n\nThis is very noticable on orchestral and acoustic songs in particular. The difference between 'Mull of Kintyre' on the London Town CD, and the track on 'All the best' is also striking![/quote]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wings - London Town (Capitol 48198)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Wings\nAlbum................: London Town (Capitol 48198)\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1978 03 31\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 56 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
