This is a man who knows a thing or two about making smart decisions, and since his retirement in 2005, Kasparov has put his powerful strategic thinking to work in business and politics, showing that a simple reliance on instincts can guide you through even the most complex challenges. With no shortage of wit or eloquence, he's answered our hardest questions about what factors can make or break a decision-making moment. --Anne Bartholomew\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-Life-Imitates-Chess-Boardroom/dp/B001OMHVEQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301512067&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-Life-Imitates-Chess-Boardroom/dp/B001OMHVEQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301512067&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca3886748a572cad792505ef9d3755e6e061dd1","amp;dn":"How+Life+Imitates+Chess+-+Garry+Kasparov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ca3886748a572cad792505ef9d3755e6e061dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,163,136,103,72,165,114,202,215,146,80,94,249,211,117,94,110,6,29,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
