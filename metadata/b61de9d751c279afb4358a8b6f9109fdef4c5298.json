A\nrestless harp-playing teenager from the countryside\nis determined to become the Disc's greatest musician.\nHis prospects look dim, especially after he forms a\nband with a rock-bashing troll and a horn-playing\ndwarf. Until, that is, he stumbles upon a guitar with\na life of its own and renames himself Buddy. Meanwhile,\nreeling from big-time job stress, Death takes a holiday,\nleaving his teenage granddaughter to look after the\nfamily business. Like girls all over the Disc, she falls\nfor Buddy, a problem since he's living fast and soon will\nneed her professional attention. But while the beat goes\non, no one (almost) is immune to its spell.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img222.imageshack.us/img222/1489/29737538.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img222.imageshack.us/img222/1489/29737538.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/4513/wsscreens.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/4513/wsscreens.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Lee\nJane Horrocks\nJune Whitfield\nAnnette Crosbie\nEleanor Bron\nGraham Crowden\nAndy Hockley\nNeil Morrissey\nBernard Wrigley\n\nORiGiNAL Source: TWOEDGE/DVD &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/720*400/29fps\nAudio: AAC/2ch/128Kbps\nSize Of File: 1.27GB &amp; 300MB/x7Eps\nSample Included: Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61de9d751c279afb4358a8b6f9109fdef4c5298","amp;dn":"Terry.Pratchetts.Discworld.Collection.DVDRip.H264-BINGO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61de9d751c279afb4358a8b6f9109fdef4c5298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,29,233,215,81,194,121,175,180,53,138,139,111,145,9,253,239,76,82,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
