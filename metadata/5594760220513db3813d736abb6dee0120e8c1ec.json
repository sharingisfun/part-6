Known as one of the founders of the Latin American Boom, CortÃƒÂ¡zar influenced an entire generation of Spanish-speaking readers and writers in the Americas and Europe. He has been called both a &quot;modern master of the short story&quot; and, by Carlos Fuentes, &quot;the SimÃƒÂ³n BolÃƒÂ­var of the novel.&quot;\n\nCortÃƒÂ¡zar wrote numerous short stories, collected in such volumes as Bestiario (1951), Final del juego (1956), and Las armas secretas (1959). In 1967, English translations by Paul Blackburn of stories selected from these volumes were published by Pantheon Books as End of the Game and Other Stories. CortÃƒÂ¡zar published four novels during his lifetime: Los premios (The Winners, 1960), Hopscotch (Rayuela, 1963), 62: A Model Kit (62 Modelo para Armar, 1968), and Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973). Except for Los premios, which was translated by Elaine Kerrigan, these novels have been translated into English by Gregory Rabassa. Two other novels, El examen and Divertimiento, though written before 1960, only appeared posthumously.\n\nThe open-ended structure of Hopscotch, which invites the reader to choose between a linear and a non-linear mode of reading, has been praised by other Latin American writers, including JosÃƒÂ© Lezama Lima, Giannina Braschi, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa. CortÃƒÂ¡zar's use of interior monologue and stream of consciousness owes much to James Joyce and other modernists, but his main influences were Surrealism, the French Nouveau roman and the improvisatory aesthetic of jazz. This last interest is reflected in the notable story &quot;El perseguidor&quot; (&quot;The Pursuer&quot;), which CortÃƒÂ¡zar based on the life of the bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Blow Up and Other Stories (Pantheon, 2014) \n\n* Cronopios and Famas (New Directions, 1999)\n\n* Hopscotch (Pantheon, 2014)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2955/the-art-of-fiction-no-83-julio-cortazar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2955/the-art-of-fiction-no-83-julio-cortazar&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/19/short-story-julio-cortazar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/19/short-story-julio-cortazar&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Kirby-t.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Kirby-t.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5594760220513db3813d736abb6dee0120e8c1ec","amp;dn":"Julio+Cortazar+-++Argentine+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5594760220513db3813d736abb6dee0120e8c1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,148,118,2,32,81,61,179,129,61,115,106,187,109,238,1,32,232,193,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
