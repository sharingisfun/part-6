Originally recorded with the working title of All at Once and then renamed Carry Her, Carry Me, the band changed their mind shortly before the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release and settled on naming the album after one of its tracks, with singer Guy Garvey explaining, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to do with the fact that there have been [so many] life events. There are five members of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â€people have split up, got together, had children. It never stops, this stuff. Especially round the [age of] 40 markÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and yet I wanted to remain celebratory about that. EverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling relief, with remorse, next to joy, next to loss.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGarvey spent time in New York recently, but ElbowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest album remains anchored in the doughty verities of North-west England, notwithstanding the American influence on the lyrics to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fly Boy Blue/LunetteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“New York MorningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Despite being written by different combinations of the line-up, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possibly their most homogenous album, most songs riding gentle pulses of percussion, organ and piano, guitars circling the action. At times, there are echoes of Krautrock and Terry Riley. Garvey remains a master of character, as with the roaring boys in Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Sad CaptainsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and while several songs dissect his own relationships, his tribute to asylum-seekers in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Blanket of NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ displays a noble empathy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c66f52d4dd0fb6c59b322d6f9107cf58ce28a04","amp;dn":"Elbow+-+The+Take+Off+and+Landing+of+Everything+%282014%29+FLAC+Beola","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c66f52d4dd0fb6c59b322d6f9107cf58ce28a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,102,245,45,77,208,251,108,89,179,34,214,249,16,124,245,140,226,138,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
