Eliminating all 'guess work' and 'audio myths', this book reveals the science behind good tone.\nNot intended for beginner, it brings intermediate-level circuit designer to advanced level, with over 200 circuit diagrams and figures, as well as new research into the distortion mechanisms of tubes and unique tone-manipulation techniques. An essential reference text for any amp enthusiast!\n\nTable of contents:\n1. The common Cathode, Triode Gain Stage\n2. Coupling\n3. The Small-Signal Pentode\n4. Valves in Parralel\n5. The Cathode Follower\n6. The Cascode\n7. The Cathodyne Phase Inverter\n8. The Long-Tailed Pair Phase Inverter\n9. Feedback Theory\n10. Tone Controls and Tone Stack\n11. Effects Loops\n12.
