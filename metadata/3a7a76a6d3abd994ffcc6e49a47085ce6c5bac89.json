Evile, yet to be called so, initially formed in 1999 playing covers in their local area. Initially Influenced by bands such as Metallica, Sepultura, Exodus, Annihilator and Slayer to name but a few, the band would create Ã¢â‚¬Å“EvileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2003. Despite being un-signed at the time, Evile were hand-picked to headline the second stage of Bloodstock Open Air Ã¢â‚¬â„¢06.\n\nAfter seeing their performance at Bloodstock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢06 the legendary Earache Records offered Evile a record deal. They signed in October Ã¢â‚¬â„¢06. Evile would go on to record their debut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enter the GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in CopenhagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sweet Silence Studios with Flemming Rasmussen of Metallica fame at the helm. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kerrang!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dubbed Evile to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Carrying the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whole Ã¢â‚¬ËœrevivalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on their shouldersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with other positive reviews from press such as Metal Hammer, Terrorizer, Zero Tolerance and Classic Rock Magazine. Evile would go on to win Metal HammerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get in the RingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ battle of the bands competition on Rockworld TV.\n\nThe band went on to be main support to Megadeth (Feb/Mar of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢08 in Europe) and Exodus (Apr of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢08 in Europe) which in the same month saw EvileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThrasherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ included on Xbox360/PS3 videogame Rockband as downloadable content.\n\nThe second chapter in EvileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history comes by the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“Infected NationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ produced by Russ Russell and original artwork by Michael Whelan. A modern take on Thrash Metal, finding the band coming into a sound of their own. The album went into the top 100 album chart in the UK after its release on September 21st Ã¢â‚¬â„¢09. Evile kicked off the release on September 25th Ã¢â‚¬â„¢09 with a release show/party at Islington Academy, London to then embark on a 2 month long European tour with Amon Amarth and Entombed. After playing 2 headline shows in Germany on the way to Scandinavia, disaster struck when founding bassist Mike Alexander (1977-2009) collapsed in Lulea, Sweden and tragically died on his way to hospital from a pulmonary embolism. He was 32 years old.\n\nThe band would organise two special tribute shows to Mike (in Leeds and London, UK) in December 09 running a special raffle in which many bands donated items to raise money for MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, some of which included Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer and Machine Head. After a short break the band announced they would continue as they meant to go on. Auditions were held and Evile subsequently welcomed new member Joel Graham (ex-Rise to Addiction) into the fold to permanently take on the bass duties.\n\n2010 saw Evile tour extensively throughout North America with bands such as Kreator, Overkill, Forbidden, Voivod, Vader and Warbringer, aswell as European festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Bloodstock Open Air and Hellfest.\n\nOn 31 May, Evile revealed that they'd begun working on their 3rd studio album.
