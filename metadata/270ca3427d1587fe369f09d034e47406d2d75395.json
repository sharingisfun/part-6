Jamming onstage with bluegrass icons David Grisman and Ricky Skaggs, she played her mandolin with a sure touch and real joy. It looked and sounded comfortable in her then twelve-year-old hands. She started writing songs on the guitar and took up the banjo. While her instrumental talents are formidable, let\\'s make one thing clear: Sarah is a singer. Her voice is velvety smooth, agile, and powerful, occasionally reminiscent of such disparate artists as Natalie Maines and Patty Griffin.\\&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270ca3427d1587fe369f09d034e47406d2d75395","amp;dn":"Sarah+Jarosz+-+Song+Up+In+Her+Head+%282009%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270ca3427d1587fe369f09d034e47406d2d75395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,12,163,66,125,21,135,254,54,159,9,208,52,228,116,6,210,215,83,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
