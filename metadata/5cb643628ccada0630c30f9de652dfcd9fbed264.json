Dealing with a plethora of issues that Townshend was struggling with, including alcoholism, drug abuse, marital problems and deceased friends. Empty Glass also contained the devotional love song, &quot;Let My Love Open the Door&quot;, which became a top ten hit single in the United States, along with the other (modestly successful) singles, &quot;Rough Boys&quot; and &quot;A Little Is Enough&quot;.\n\nEMPTY GLASS [320k MP3]\n\n01. &quot;Rough Boys&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n02. &quot;I Am an Animal&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51 \n03. &quot;And I Moved&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n04. &quot;Let My Love Open the Door&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44 \n05. &quot;Jools and Jim&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36 \n06. &quot;Keep on Working&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n07. &quot;Cat's in the Cupboard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n08. &quot;A Little Is Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42 \n09. &quot;Empty Glass&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25 \n10. &quot;Gonna Get Ya&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:25 \n\nBonus Tracks\n\n11. &quot;I Am an Animal&quot; (Demo Alternate Vocal Version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 \n12. &quot;Keep on Working&quot; (Demo Alternate Vocal Version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32 \n13. &quot;And I Moved&quot; (Demo Alternate Vocal Version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n14. &quot;Gonna Get Ya&quot; (Work-in-Progress Long Version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:24 \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHistory:\n\nThe origins of the album's title are described in the following quote from Pete Townshend (taken from the exclusive interview with Murray Lerner off the film 'The Who: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival'):\n\n&quot;And when I did my first solo album, I called it 'Empty Glass', 'cause of this idea that when you go to the tavern -- which is to God, you know -- and you ask for His love -- He's the bartender, you know -- and He gives you a drink, and what you have to give Him is an empty glass. You know there's no point giving Him your heart if it's full already; there's no point going to God if your heart's full of Doris.&quot;\n\nThis concept was derived from the work of the Persian poet Hafiz, which Townshend became interested in from his involvement with Meher Baba.\n\nThe album was written and recorded between 1978 and 1980, when activity with The Who had started to pick up again, and Townshend found himself having to write for both his solo projects and his band. As a result, Empty Glass, when compared with The Who's 1981 album Face Dances, was considered the superior album, with many critics calling it a Who album that never was. Roger Daltrey later commented that he felt let down by Townshend, and that many of the songs from the album would have worked well for The Who, among them &quot;Rough Boys&quot; and &quot;Empty Glass&quot;; Townshend countered by saying that he felt &quot;Rough Boys&quot; was the one song Daltrey would have wanted clarified (in terms of the song's homoerotic subtext) and toned down if he were to sing it, thus defeating its message, while &quot;Empty Glass&quot; had been recorded during sessions for Who Are You in 1978, with a version featuring Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass released on the 1996 reissue of that album. This version is notable for the more suicidal undertones in the lyrics that were changed in the final, solo version. The line &quot;Killing each other, then we jump off the ledge&quot; on the Who Are You sessions was changed to &quot;Killing each other by driving a wedge&quot;.\n\nThe sleeve was designed by photographer Bob Carlos Clarke. [1] The album's title is an allusion to a poem by the Sufi poet Hafez.[citation needed]\n\nThe sleeve cover of the vinyl album includes this dedication:\n\nThis album is dedicated to my wife Karen\n&quot;Rough Boys&quot; is dedicated to my children Emma and Minta and to the Sex Pistols. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb643628ccada0630c30f9de652dfcd9fbed264","amp;dn":"Pete+Townshend+-+%5C%27Empty+Glass+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb643628ccada0630c30f9de652dfcd9fbed264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,182,67,98,140,202,218,6,48,195,15,157,230,82,223,205,159,190,210,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
