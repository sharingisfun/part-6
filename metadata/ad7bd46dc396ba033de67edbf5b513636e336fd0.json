Amy is a very imaginative child who has trouble differentiating fantasy from reality, and has no friends her own age as a result. She makes an imaginary friend though, her father's dead first wife Irena. At about the same time, she befriends Julia Farren, an aging reclusive actress who is alienated from her own daughter Barbara. \n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : The Curse Of The Cat People.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 054 Kbps\nLength            : 1.00 GiB for 1h 9mn 51s 729ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 540 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036733/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036733/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad7bd46dc396ba033de67edbf5b513636e336fd0","amp;dn":"The+Curse+Of+The+Cat+People+%281944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad7bd46dc396ba033de67edbf5b513636e336fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,123,212,109,195,150,186,3,61,230,126,219,245,181,19,99,110,51,111,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
