With a pithy and matter-of-fact writing style, these guides are guaranteed to calm the nerves of first-time world travelers, while still listing off-the-beaten-path finds sure to thrill even the most jaded globetrotters. Lonely Planet has been perfecting its guidebooks for nearly 30 years and as a result, has the experience and know-how similar to an older sibling's &quot;been there&quot; advice. The original backpacker's bible, the LP series has recently widened its reach. While still giving insights for the low-budget traveler, the books now list a wide range of accommodations and itineraries for those with less time than money.\nLonely Planet's Greece is an expert guide to this incredible country, covering everything from the narrowest walkable gorge in the world to classic Greek myths. The authors provide information on inter-island ferries accompanied by a ferry map; extensive writings on history, culture, and mythology; place names in Greek script; and advice on choosing a quiet or gregarious island vacation. A special color feature covers Greek art. --Kathryn True --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nReview\n&quot;For sheer global reach and dogged research, attention must be paid to Lonely Planet...&quot; -- Los Angeles Times, February 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba29a6f31380eec7a71831428d79d42c251b8707","amp;dn":"Greece+%28Country+Guide%29+8th+Edition+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba29a6f31380eec7a71831428d79d42c251b8707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,41,166,243,19,128,238,199,167,24,49,66,141,121,212,44,37,27,135,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
