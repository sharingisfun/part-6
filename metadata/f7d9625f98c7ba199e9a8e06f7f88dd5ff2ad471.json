It can also be used to support the mobile \nuser, both for hot desking within the enterprise and also to provide \nremote access at home, or on the road. The system allows several \nconnections to the same desktop, providing an invaluable tool for \ncollaborative or shared working in the workplace or classroom. Computer \nsupport within the geographically spread family is an ever popular use.\n\nFor the individual user, one common scenario is using VNC to help \ntroubleshoot the computer of a distant less-technically-savvy relative. \nIn other words, sitting at your desk in Baltimore, you could use VNC to \ntake control of your relative's PC in California and show them how to \ninstall and use some new software package by actually doing it yourself.\n\nA very common business application of VNC is in remote system administration, \nwhere it is used to allow administrators to take control of employee machines \nto diagnose and fix problems, or to access and administer server machines \nwithout making a trip to the console. VNC can also be used to provide a flexible \nhot-desking and road-warrior environment by allowing employees to access their \noffice desktop and server machines from any machine in the company's offices or \nfrom other remote sites, regardless of the type of computers involved at either \nend.\n\nVNC is widely used in educational contexts, for example to allow a distributed \ngroup of students simultaneously to view a computer screen being manipulated by \nan instructor, or to allow the instructor to take control of the students' \ncomputers to provide assistance.\n\n==============================================================================\n\nOperating System Support:\n\nWINDOWS NT 4, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2 (x86 &amp; x64)\n\n==============================================================================\n\nHow to Install:\n\n1.
