Having said that, I really rate this 2CD collection very highly, it&amp;#039;s much better value than &amp;#039;40 LICKS&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;HOT ROCKS&amp;#039;; my only gripe is that the version of &amp;#039;Midnight Rambler&amp;#039; isn&amp;#039;t the live version, which you can get on &amp;#039;HOT ROCKS&amp;#039; (it&amp;#039;s saving grace) or the excellent &amp;#039;LET IT BLEED&amp;#039;, a must have album for Stones fans of a later generation. The bass intro on the live &amp;#039;Midnight Rambler&amp;#039; is really raunchy.\nI don&amp;#039;t understand why all The Rolling Stones back catalogue isn&amp;#039;t at a buyer friendly price, say a fiver an LP? It&amp;#039;s not as if they need the money...surely?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86d44d98754db7391d0b06e4433add7b640ad9a1","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Rolled+Gold+2007++-+CD+2+of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86d44d98754db7391d0b06e4433add7b640ad9a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,212,77,152,117,77,183,57,29,11,6,228,67,58,221,123,100,10,217,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
