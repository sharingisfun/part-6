First he needs musicians and singers: things slowly start to click when he finds three fine-voiced females virtually in his back yard, a lead singer (Deco) at a wedding, and, responding to his ad, an aging trumpet player, Joey &quot;The Lips&quot; Fagan. Song by song, gig by gig, the Commitments start their climb to the top: Dublin gets soul. But internal strife also builds: Deco is insufferable, Joey's a Casanova, and Jimmy may lack the seasoning to hold things together. Will the Commitments slip away?\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmjaadc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmjaadc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmkaadc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmkaadc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmlaadc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmlaadc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmmaadc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/bapmmaadc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ba69b35390ac4dee62bf0be06080a3194f31b3","amp;dn":"The.Commitments.1991.x264.AC3-2.0.ENGSUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ba69b35390ac4dee62bf0be06080a3194f31b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,186,105,179,83,144,172,77,238,98,191,11,224,96,128,163,25,79,49,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
