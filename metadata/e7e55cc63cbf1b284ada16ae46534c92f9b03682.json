They are all calamities of global proportions that started in the West, and they affected hundreds of millions of people all over the world. \nThe difference: in world wars, people lost their lives and they sustained physical injuries. In the FE crisis people lost their jobs, homes, savings and livelihoods, and they sustained mental and psychological injuries.\n\nChristianity is the major source of morality in the West. It failed to prevent WW1 and WW2; and it failed to prevent the many FE crises in the past. Unfortunately, this means we shall witness more FE crises in the future coming from the West.\n\n\nIn this upload we have 34 more titles about the subject:\n\n-  Aliber &amp; Zoega - Preludes to the Icelandic Financial Crisis (2011)\n\n-  Aslund - The Last Shall be the First; The East European Financial Crisis, 2008-10 (2010)\n\n-  Banks - See No Evil; Uncovering the Truth Behind the Financial Crisis (2011)\n\n-  Biggs - Hedgehogging (2006)\n\n-  Bonner &amp; Wiggin - The New Empire of Debt; The Rise and Fall of an Epic Financial Bubble, 2nd ed.
