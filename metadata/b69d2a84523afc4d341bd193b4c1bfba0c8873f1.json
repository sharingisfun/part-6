Submarine weapons, equipment, personnel, and shore support systems are discussed first in the context of Japanese naval preparations for war and later during the war. Both successes and missed opportunities are analyzed in operations ranging from the California coast through the Pacific and Indian Oceans to the coast of German-occupied France. Appendixes include lists of Japanese submarine losses and the biographies of key Japanese submarine officers. Rare illustrations and specifically commissioned operational maps enhance the text.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Japanese-Submarine-Force-World/dp/1557500800&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Japanese-Submarine-Force-World/dp/1557500800&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69d2a84523afc4d341bd193b4c1bfba0c8873f1","amp;dn":"The+Japanese+Submarine+Force+and+World+War+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69d2a84523afc4d341bd193b4c1bfba0c8873f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,157,42,132,82,58,252,77,52,27,209,147,180,193,191,186,12,136,115,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
