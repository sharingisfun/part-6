The film takes place in modern day Afghanistan. Uraz (Omar Sharif), the son of Tursen (Jack Palance), the stable master for a feudal lord, is a master horseman who lives by a primitive code of honor. Uruz's family honor is damaged when he breaks his leg playing the game which is the Afghani equivalent of polo. His father, who lost a lot of money betting on his son, will barely speak to him. To regain the family honor (and wealth) he must somehow re-learn how to ride -- after his injuries cost him his leg below the knee. In the face of great obstacles, and despite the derision and treachery of others, he gains the chance to play in the games given by the king of Afghanistan. The footage of the horsemanship in these dangerous and anarchic games is one of the real highlights of this film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067216/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067216/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nJohn Frankenheimer\n\n\n\tOmar Sharif\t... \tUraz\n\n\tLeigh Taylor-Young\t... \tZareh\n\n\tJack Palance\t... \tTursen\n\tDavid de Keyser\t... \tMukhi\n\tPeter Jeffrey\t... \tHayatal\n\nThe Horsemen (1971) Omar Shariff- Dual,Eng,Span.avi\nFile Size : 780 Mb.\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:45:07\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x224\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 794 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 120 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177553eb722682fd068eae81185f3d748dafaf72","amp;dn":"The+Horsemen+%281971%29+Omar+Shariff-+Dual%2CEng%2CSpan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177553eb722682fd068eae81185f3d748dafaf72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,117,83,235,114,38,130,253,6,142,174,129,24,95,61,116,141,175,175,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
