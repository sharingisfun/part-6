Actually, both are meeting their lovers, and both go to the family's county home, Traunitz castle. Surprising each other, there's sophisticated laughter; they decide to continue as planned. Dinner, however, is interrupted by the arrival of Angela and her mute attendant, also named Traunitz. The next day, the child initiates a game of &quot;Chinese roulette,&quot; in which one team tries to guess which of them the other team is thinking of by asking questions. The game has an edge of cruelty and the results are explosive.\n\nSpecs:\n\nRuntime: 1:22:20\nFrame Width: 592\nFrame Height: 39\nFrame Rate: 23 fps\nSpoken Language(s): German\nSubtitles: English (included)\n\nIMdb link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074312/?ref_=ttloc_loc_tt\n\nRamisRip hopes to present you the best obscure titles from world cinema.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404b466812629358f6883e65756e40532ddc617b","amp;dn":"Chinesisches+Roulette+-+%28Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder-1976%29+%5BEnglish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404b466812629358f6883e65756e40532ddc617b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,75,70,104,18,98,147,88,246,136,62,101,117,110,64,83,45,220,97,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
