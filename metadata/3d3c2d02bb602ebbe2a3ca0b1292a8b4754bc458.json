I think his standup fairly blew chunks (predictable, not very clever), but I have committed to getting more standup comedy well-seeded here, so IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m offering it up before I delete the torrent. Who knows? Maybe youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll like his stuff. That idiotic Brian Posehn torrent I put up is doing well, so thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no accounting for taste. This torrent has all three of his albums. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_DiPaolo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_DiPaolo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNick Di Paolo (born January 31, 1962 in Danvers, Massachusetts) is an Italian-American stand-up comedian, writer and radio host formerly on 92.3 Free FM in New York City until May 24, 2007, when the station changed formats.
