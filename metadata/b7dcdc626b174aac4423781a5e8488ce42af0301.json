(They Long To Be) Close To You 03:44 \n\nThere's a certain inherent sadness listening to this concise 12-song collection of the Carpenters' early hits, especially as it opens with &quot;We've Only Just Begun,&quot; with its hopeful, dreamy lyrics -- for it was never supposed to be definitive, just the first of at least two such collections. But changes in the public's taste and a slackening (though never a disappearance) of hits for the duo, and Karen Carpenter's death in 1983, made this the first and only real mass choice for a Carpenters collection. Ten of the duo's dozen Top Ten hits are present, from &quot;Close to You&quot; to &quot;Top of the World,&quot; with their gorgeous and original slow ballad interpretation of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and their cover of Carole King's &quot;It's Going to Take Some Time&quot; thrown in to offer a slightly wider perspective. Listening to this material, it's easy to accuse the Carpenters of being hopelessly retro even in their own time -- bear in mind that &quot;We've Only Just Begun&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot; being contemporaneous with the Allman Brothers' At Fillmore East and Eat a Peach and you get the idea. But the lush melodies brought out in Richard Carpenter's arrangements and Karen's singing are justification in themselves.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7dcdc626b174aac4423781a5e8488ce42af0301","amp;dn":"The+Carpenters+-+The+Singles+1969-73+%282014%29+SHM+Universal+Music+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7dcdc626b174aac4423781a5e8488ce42af0301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,220,220,98,107,23,74,172,68,35,120,26,94,132,136,206,66,175,3,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
