Many people says that it's a dance-oriented music, but it's not exactly. It's just great instrumental/electronic music for rest.\nI think it's one of the best disks in my collection.\n\nMore info  on http://www.bajofondo.com\n\nAll tracks are separate &amp; with tags. Ripped by EAC. All pictures in booklet is 300 pixels/inch.\nIf you want to burn this CD, you can download cole2K Nero audio plug-in (google helps you), or use alcohol, EAC  etc. \nI can't seed all the time, but I'll seed every night, till someone downloads. Just wait. I'll be happy if you seed few days after download.\nIf you think you want something else, just tell me here.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English. I'm Russian.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:288e8905c6c5caefb9605c398dc2fc32c930e65f","amp;dn":"Bajofondo+Tango+Club+-+Mar+Dulce+%5BFLAC%5D+%2B+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"288e8905c6c5caefb9605c398dc2fc32c930e65f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,142,137,5,198,197,202,239,185,96,92,57,141,194,252,50,201,48,230,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
