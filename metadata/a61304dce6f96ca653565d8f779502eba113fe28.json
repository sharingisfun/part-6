Laing (Author)\nA series of dialogue-scenarios, which can be read as poems or plays, describing the &quot;knots&quot; and impasses in various kinds of human relationships.\n\n&quot;The voices of known demons rise from these pages: demons of guilt, demons of self-justification; demons of perverse will, demons of self-destruction. All the enemies of the human spirit are arrayed here as vividly, as warningly as in a medieval morality play. Those who believe that to unmask the enemy is a first step toward confounding him will find this a practical as well as a moral book.&quot;\n-- Melvin Maddocks, The Christian Science Monitor \n\nISBN-10: 0394717767\nISBN-13: 978-0394717760","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61304dce6f96ca653565d8f779502eba113fe28","amp;dn":"%28Selected+Works+of+R.D.+Laing%2C+7%29+1998+-+Knots+%2898p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61304dce6f96ca653565d8f779502eba113fe28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,19,4,220,230,249,108,166,83,86,93,143,119,149,2,235,161,19,254,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
