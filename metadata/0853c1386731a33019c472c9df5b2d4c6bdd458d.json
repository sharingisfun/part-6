The majority of solutions on offer, from using efficient light bulbs to biking to work, focus on individual lifestyle changes, yet the scale of the crisis requires far deeper adjustments. Ecology and Socialism argues that time still remains to save humanity and the planet, but only by building social movements for environmental justice that can demand qualitative changes in our economy, workplaces, and infrastructure.\n\nChris Williams is a longtime environmental activist, professor of physics and chemistry at Pace University, and chair of the science department at Packer Collegiate Institute. He lives in New York City.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0853c1386731a33019c472c9df5b2d4c6bdd458d","amp;dn":"Ecology+and+Socialism%3A+Solutions+to+Capitalist+Ecological+Crisis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0853c1386731a33019c472c9df5b2d4c6bdd458d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,83,193,56,103,49,163,48,25,196,114,201,223,91,45,76,107,221,69,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
