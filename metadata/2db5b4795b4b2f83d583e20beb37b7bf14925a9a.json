Among its many tales?some funny, others intensely moving?we meet Feynman?s first wife, Arlene, who taught him of love?s irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. We are also given a fascinating narrative of the investigation of the space shuttle Challenger?s explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disaster?s cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen. A New York Times bestseller.\n\n&quot;Feynman?s voice echoes raw and direct through these pages.&quot;?James Gleick, New York Times Book Review\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/fall00/032092.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/fall00/032092.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db5b4795b4b2f83d583e20beb37b7bf14925a9a","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+-+Richard+P+Feynman+-+What+Do+You+Care+What+Other+Peo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db5b4795b4b2f83d583e20beb37b7bf14925a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,181,180,121,91,75,47,131,213,131,226,11,235,55,183,191,20,146,90,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
