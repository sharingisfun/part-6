The ruins of the technologically-advanced, eerily-enigmatic ancient civilization promise their discoverer fame, fortune, and powerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but hold earth-shattering secrets about the origin of man.\n\nWhile world-famous linguist and archaeologist, Thomas Lourds, is shooting a film that dramatizes his flamboyant life and scientific achievements, satellites spot impossibly ancient ruins along the Spanish coast. Lourds knows exactly what it means: the Lost Continent of Atlantis has been found. The race is on, and Lourds' challengers will do anything to get there first.\nWhoever controls the Lost Continent will control the world.\n\nTHE LUCIFER CODE\n\nAN ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT HAS REMAINED CONCEALED FOR CENTURIES -- WITHIN ITS PAGES LIES THE KEY TO THE MOST UNHOLY SECRET KNOWN TO MANKIND.\n\nA sacred brotherhood has sworn, generation after generation, to protect this terrifying truth from those who would use it to unleash doomsday upon mankind.\n\nWhen the unthinkable happens, and the holy scroll is uncovered, the race is on to reveal the true meaning of the cryptic language. Only one man, Dr. Thomas Lourds, the world's foremost scholar of ancient languages, who we first met in the bestselling novel The Atlantis Code, can safely decipher this most deadly scripture.\n\nLourds soon becomes the bait in the most lethal manhunt -- knowing he must confront the true face of evil if the world is to be saved.\n\nTHE TEMPLE MOUNT CODE\n\nAn old friend summons dashing linguistics professor Thomas Lourds to Jerusalem to examine an ancient text. But IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also wants the same document. Khamenei and many others believe that the book contains a secret that will allow its owner to rule all of Islam and wage a Global Jihad the likes of which has never been seen before.\n\nArriving in Jerusalem, Lourds discovers that his friend has been murdered and his apartment ransacked. With the help of Miriam Abata, a beautiful Iranian-American Jewish graduate student, he races against the clock to seek the dangerous document: Lourds seeks to save civilization while his enemies hope to destroy it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91dec39cfa8a5fc13df414c927e2aba7556607f9","amp;dn":"Thomas+Lourds+Series+-+Charles+Brokaw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91dec39cfa8a5fc13df414c927e2aba7556607f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,222,195,156,250,138,95,193,61,244,20,201,39,226,171,167,85,102,7,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
