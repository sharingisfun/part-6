While there, they will be working with a small team to track down one of the masterminds behind the USS Cole bombing: a high-ranking Al Qaeda operative known as The Panther. Ruthless and elusive, he's wanted for multiple terrorist acts and murders-and the U.S. government is determined to bring him down, no matter the cost. As latecomers to a deadly game, John and Kate don't know the rules, the players, or the score. What they do know is that there is more to their assignment than meets the eye-and that the hunters are about to become the hunted. Filled with breathtaking plot turns and told in John Corey's inimitable voice, THE PANTHER is a brilliant depiction of one of the most treacherous countries in the world and raises disturbing questions about whether we can ever know who our enemies - or our allies - really are\n\nFull retail. John Corey Series #6. Calibre ready.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f3ccceb46a0552cf0d6bda78e20cc2a6f452f0","amp;dn":"The+Panther+by+Nelson+Demille+%28ePub%2C+Mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f3ccceb46a0552cf0d6bda78e20cc2a6f452f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,243,204,206,180,106,5,82,207,13,107,218,120,226,12,194,166,244,82,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
