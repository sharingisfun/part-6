If you were to document it all from afar, who might you see? What might you overhear? On his new album The Party, Andy Shauf puts himself in that exact position, as he crafts a series of connected vignettes that offer up tiny observations from a single night. Throughout the recordâ€™s 10 songs, Shauf sings with a wallflowerâ€™s remove and knowing specificity.\r\nThe recurring characters the Saskatchewan songwriter and multi-instrumentalist renders are rough but familiar approximations of people he knows: Thereâ€™s a dude who awkwardly shows up before anyone else (â€œEarly to the Partyâ€), a person who admits buried truths that blur the line between friendship and attraction (â€œTo Youâ€), a woman who dances by herself without fear (â€œEyes Of Them Allâ€), and a guy who collapses and dies after swearing off smoking. â€œAlexander wondered why no life flashed before his eyesâ€¦ why he found no peace of mind,â€ Shauf sings grimly in â€œAlexander All Alone,â€ amid a steady tick-tock plinking of piano.\r\n\r\nConsidering the songsâ€™ rotating first-person viewpoints, Shauf also employs these archetypes as stand-ins to consider his personal faults â€” and even portray the loneliness and claustrophobia that can come with living in a small town. In â€œThe Worst In You,â€ Shauf embodies someone who wrongly assumes that his significant other is cheating when he canâ€™t find her at the party. â€œWhy do I always find the worst in you?â€ he wonders. â€œDo you always find the worst in me?â€\r\n\r\nAt the spine of the album is â€œQuite Like You,â€ in which Shauf narrates a half-drunken encounter with his best friendâ€™s girlfriend, whoâ€™s upset after another breakup (â€œI wonder what the hell he did this time?â€). Instead of winning her over, he tipsily oversteps and self-servingly throws his friend under the bus. â€œYou know Iâ€™ve never really met someone like you,â€ he sings clumsily, unwittingly pushing her back into the arms of his friend. In the follow-up, â€œBegin Again,â€ Shauf is stuck as the same friend brags about seeing someone else on the side. â€œI donâ€™t give a damn about you fooling around behind Sherryâ€™s back / Itâ€™s just the one that you found is one that I need.â€ As he fumes, he imagines the power to end the conversation in post-apocalyptic fashion â€” â€œOh, from the sky, a brilliant light will dissolve us allâ€ â€” just as his voice expands into shimmering cosmic echoes.\r\n\r\nMusically, The Party is just as robustly realized. After last yearâ€™s superb bedroom-produced album The Bearer Of Bad News â€” for which Shauf initially drafted as many as 100 songs â€” The Partyâ€˜s narrative framework lends focus and restraint to his prolific writing. Shauf melds chipper British pop and breezy folk for a sound built from lush pianos, mellow acoustic guitars and jazzy rhythms. The result recalls classic pop songwriters in the vein of Harry Nilsson or Randy Newman, coupled with the plainspoken timbre of a Paul Simon, albeit with a laconic Canadian drawl. Shauf also possesses a keen, emotive ear for complex arrangements and lavish orchestrations. First working in Germany, and later at a studio in the old CBC building in Regina, Shauf performs every instrument on the album except the strings, which were played by Colin Nealis. Songs like â€œThe Magicianâ€ and â€œEarly To The Partyâ€ are enhanced by ornate symphonic interludes that weave in between verses.\r\n\r\nAs The Party winds down, â€œMartha Swaysâ€ depicts its narrator at the end of a long night, as he dances with a girl who reminds him of his ex. The bittersweet song aches for lost love and missed opportunities. Yet as he sings â€” â€œMartha spins and I catch her hand / She smiles and laughs, bringing me backâ€ â€” Shauf gets out of his head for a moment, and hints at a new beginning full of possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 Andy Shauf - The Magician.flac\r\n02 Andy Shauf - Early To The Party.flac\r\n03 Andy Shauf - Twist Your Ankle.flac\r\n04 Andy Shauf - Quite Like You.flac\r\n05 Andy Shauf - Begin Again.flac\r\n06 Andy Shauf - The Worst In You.flac\r\n07 Andy Shauf - To You.flac\r\n08 Andy Shauf - Eyes Of Them All.flac\r\n09 Andy Shauf - Alexander All Alone.flac\r\n10 Andy Shauf - Martha Sways.flac\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: Canada\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~766-861 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4eac087b9d219cc65c75cb4177bf508bd86473","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Andy+Shauf+-+The+Party+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4eac087b9d219cc65c75cb4177bf508bd86473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,78,172,8,123,157,33,156,198,92,117,203,65,119,191,80,139,216,100,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
