It also plays .ISO images as if inserted into a physical drive.\nYeah it's an older version so it reqires no hacking or live activation, only a key. It's light and powerful and runs perfectly on 32 bit XP sp3 plus all previous Win OS's. I like it for these reasons and thought maybe you would too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab5b37c17a5a22bf585c7221ec395ef8031878a","amp;dn":"Virtual+CD+5.03+%28CD%2CISO%2CDVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab5b37c17a5a22bf585c7221ec395ef8031878a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,181,179,124,23,165,162,43,245,133,199,34,30,195,149,239,128,49,135,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
