This film is based on the early days of Def Jam Recordings and up-and-coming record producer Russell Simmons (renamed Russell Walker in the film), portrayed by Blair Underwood in his feature film debut. Russell Simmons was the film's co-producer and story consultant; he also has a cameo role in the film as a club owner named Crocket.\nPlot\nIn the movie, Russell Walker has signed all of the hottest acts to his Krush Groove record label, including Run-D.M.C., Dr. Jeckyll &amp; Mr. Hyde (Alonzo Brown), and Kurtis Blow. Rick Rubin produces their records. When Run-D.M.C. has a hit record and Russell doesn't have the money to press records, he borrows money from a street hustler. At the same time, Russell and his brother Run are both competing for the heart of R&amp;B singer-percussionist Sheila E. Also appearing in the film are LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, New Edition, the Fat Boys and some of their songs, as well as others from the likes of Chaka Khan, Debbie Harry, and the Gap Band. Members of the R&amp;B group Full Force also make a cameo in the film as bodyguards.\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Krush Groove (1985) [thePiratePimp].avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 700 MiB\nDuration : 1h 38mn\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 995 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 38mn\nBit rate : 870 Kbps\nWidth : 608 pixels\nHeight : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.727\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.170\nStream size : 612 MiB (87%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 36mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 115 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 79.2 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.59 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 471 ms\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503d6a6288f9769bedf7781aee8ad856eb8e95d1","amp;dn":"Krush+Groove+%281985%29+%5BthePiratePimp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503d6a6288f9769bedf7781aee8ad856eb8e95d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,61,106,98,136,249,118,155,237,247,120,26,238,138,216,86,235,142,149,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
