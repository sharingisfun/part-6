A famous poet, a great artist in music, his personal life, and much more. Cohen's goals and achievements are noted as well as his success in music and poetry. The author includes interviews from the people who were closest to Cohen from the start of his career, following his accomplishments. This insightful, brilliant story reflects on his dreams, his motivation, and his persistence to perform well. Simmons tracks his footsteps from the young man who just started his life to one of the most important artists in the world. An inspiring and enjoyable portrait of a famous artist that grabs the reader's attention in the first chapter. Highly Recommended to music and poetry lovers!\n\n\nA definitive Cohen biography\nBy haregrog on September 21, 2012\nRecent years have seen a number of attempts to produce Cohen biographies for an intelligent reading public, to follow up Ira Nadel's excellent but necessarily incomplete work of almost two decades ago. This one succeeds definitively. Simmons has done it with restrained, professional writing, deep research, and access to key players including Cohen himself. Some of the details are well known at this point, but even those are intriguing in the re-telling. A fresh perspective and a mature pen--not to mention the engaging narrative of the life of a beloved, humanly flawed, immensely appealing protagonist--make this the Cohen biography we have been waiting for.\n\n\nSincerely L. Cohen\nBy Michael Simmons on September 27, 2012\nSimply put, the finest biography of Leonard Cohen ever writ. Simmons (no relation to moi) covers the waterfront, spending equal time on Cohen's music and literary work, as well as the chronology of his life. The personal anecdotes are numerous and revealing, from teenaged Leonard hypnotizing the clothes off the family maid, to jamming on &quot;Suzanne&quot; with Jimi Hendrix, to his many love affairs. The writing is smart, sharp, funny. By book's end, I was left wanting more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec82907c79f102a67fe44ef838949899b9d4678","amp;dn":"I%27m+Your+Man+%3A+The+Life+of+Leonard+Cohen%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec82907c79f102a67fe44ef838949899b9d4678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,200,41,7,199,159,16,42,103,254,68,239,131,137,73,137,155,157,70,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
