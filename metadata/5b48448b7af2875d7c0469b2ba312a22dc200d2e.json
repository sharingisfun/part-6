The highest quality album covers I could find are also included within the covers folder. \n\nNotes:\n\nTags use &quot;Supercell&quot; instead of the stylized &quot;supercell&quot;\n\nHakushu Kassai Utaawase uses Japanese characters and as such the Eastern Language pack for Windows will need to be installed in order to display them correctly. If you are using a Unix operating system I recommend Lat2-Terminus16 for a font, as it supports some 300 different languages.\n\nSome singles have Supercell listed as the album artist; this is incorrect tagging as singles are not albums.\n\nI will Romanize the Japanese characters and fix the tagging in the next release.\n\n\n\n[Albums]\n\nSupercell\nToday is a Beautiful Day\n\n\n[Singles]\n\nGiniro Hikousen\nHakushu Kassai Utaawase\nKimi no Shiranai Monogatari\nKokuhaku - Bokura no Ashiato\nMy Dearest\nSayonara Memories\nThe Bravery\nUtakata Hanabi\n\n\n\nDescription: Supercell (stylized as supercell) is a Japanese 11-member J-pop music group led by songwriter Ryo, which formed in 2007 as a dÃ…ï¿½jin music group. The other 10 members are artists and designers who provide illustrations in album booklets and music videos. Supercell started out by making use of the Hatsune Miku Vocaloid singing synthesizer to produce vocals for songs submitted to the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website. The popularity of the songs led the group to release their independent self-titled album Supercell (2008). Supercell later signed to Sony Music Entertainment Japan and had a professional release of their Supercell album in March 2009, which was updated with more songs.\n\nSupercell made a transition to vocalist Nagi Yanagi with their debut single &quot;Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari&quot; (2009). Two more singles featuring Yanagi were released in 2010, followed by Supercell's second album Today Is A Beautiful Day (2011), which was Yanagi's last contribution with Supercell. Following Yanagi's departure, Supercell held auditions for vocalists, and two girls were chosen out of about 2,000 candidates: 15-year-old Koeda and 17-year-old Chelly. Both vocalists sing the theme songs for the 2011 anime Guilty Crown, and released their first singles with Supercell in 2011. Chelly sings under the alternate name Egoist.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b48448b7af2875d7c0469b2ba312a22dc200d2e","amp;dn":"%5BAegrus%5D+%5B2013%5D+Supercell+Discography+%5BMP3%5D+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b48448b7af2875d7c0469b2ba312a22dc200d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,72,68,139,122,242,135,93,124,4,105,178,186,49,42,34,220,32,13,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
