It contains all the best known songs, plus a couple of rarities (&quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; from the B-side of the &quot;Johnny B&quot; single, and &quot;Time After Time&quot; from the &quot;Nervous Night Live&quot; video).\nUnfortunately, all the songs come from the three Columbia albums (&quot;Nervous Night,&quot; &quot;One Way Home&quot; and &quot;Zig Zag&quot;), so if you're looking for your favorite song from &quot;Amore,&quot; &quot;Out Of Body&quot; or &quot;The Hooters Live,&quot; you're out of luck. I suppose Sony didn't want to bother getting the rights to use songs from another label. Luckily, this won't come as a disappointment to anyone but a die-hard fan, since casual listeners have probably never heard any songs off the non-Columbia albums.\nIf you are looking for a really good Hooters collection, I'd definitely recommend you get this album.
