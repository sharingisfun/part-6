A punk and bluegrass mix, the Duluth, Minn., quintet's acoustic thrash established it as a must-see live act. Stars and Satellites possesses moments when the band seems to be in overdrive, but overall it's much more introspective. A current touchstone would be the Avett Brothers, another act known for its raucous moments that moved toward singer-songwriter fare. Frontman Dave Simonett here remains a talent when it comes to composing, and the band's ability to pound acoustically is beyond question. The quiet solitude of &quot;Alone&quot; and mournful &quot;The Calm and the Crying Wind&quot; wear their emotions on their titles, but they would've been rare on previous Turtles LPs. Brawny instrumental &quot;Risk&quot; capably displays the band's progressive bluegrass side. As a whole, Stars and Satellites is full of wonder\n\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20120226 (139.1)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35cf6890ef845c9af724d5081a3e1091de600580","amp;dn":"Trampled+By+Turtles...Stars+and+Satellites%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35cf6890ef845c9af724d5081a3e1091de600580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,207,104,144,239,132,92,154,247,36,213,8,26,62,16,145,222,96,5,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
