The results, released here for the first time, is some of the best shot footage ever seen of these performers working their own element. \n\nOh, 35mm cameras might've yielded better quality images, but in terms of where these guys placed themselves, on-stage or in the tour van, and how close they got to their subjects, and how they set up the audio feeds, this is as good a piece of work as was ever seen on Monterey Pop, and better than most other concert material of its era -- it's amazing to watch Thornton talk about writing &quot;Ball and Chain,&quot; and the royalty checks she gets thanks to Janis Joplin's recording, in a segue right out of talking about her first meeting with Muddy Waters (who's sitting right there). George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith moves almost too fast for the cameras to keep up with him. And Big Joe Turner, looking only a little less fit (and not sounding &quot;lesser&quot; in any way) than he did in Edward L. Cahn's 1956 feature Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock, is worth the price of admission by himself. \n\nAnd they're just a prelude for some of the best footage ever seen on Muddy Waters, who was still playing his own guitar at the time -- and superbly on &quot;Long Distance Call&quot; -- but is so powerful a presence as a singer, that for the first time it's easy for this reviewer to understand how Chess Records thought to make him &quot;just&quot; a vocalist. The bonus materials include complete performances of &quot;She's Nineteen Years Old&quot; by Muddy, and Thornton doing &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock Me Baby,&quot; and audio-only material on Turner (&quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot;) and Smith (&quot;Summertime&quot;), plus extended artist interview segments with Thornton and Turner. The bonus performances alone are worth the asking price of this disc, and it is absolutely essential viewing for Muddy Waters fans. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 664mb\nDuration.... 00:59:07\nCodec.......
