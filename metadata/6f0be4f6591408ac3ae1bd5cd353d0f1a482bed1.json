This is the fourth album in a quadruply (together with Body Heat, The Dude and Back On The Block) of amazing productions, a unique and once in a lifetime reunion of artistic talent. Like other Q albums, the magic formula is diversity, a perfex mix of R&amp;B, jazz, pop, rap, it's all here. In a way, it's the same concept that Q &quot;produced&quot; into Michael Jackson's thriller, making it one of the best albums of all time. Just some of the artist in perfect colaboration: Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Gloria Estefan, Brandy, Bono, Luis Miguel, Toots Thielemans, Barry White, Stomp, Chaka Kahn, Take Six, Babyface, the list goes on..... \nThis album came out in 1995, alternative rock was still going strong then, and at the time it was underated??!!!Some critizized it as overblown and overly-produced. I can't think of anybody today just getting artists of this caliber and history into the studio. Not to mention production and technical skill (WOW) this album sounds as if it was recorded yesterday (never outdated). It is a required listening and blueprint for aspiring music producers. \nA true historic recording, a must have for any music collection&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
