Now what do we got here...Unleashed in the East is Judas Priest's first live album, recorded live in Tokyo, Japan during the Hell Bent for Leather Tour in 1979. It was released in September 1979 and became the band's best-selling album up to that point, reaching the US Top 100 and the UK Top Ten, eventually the album became one of the five Judas Priest albums to gain a RIAA platinum certification.\n\nTo what extent the album was really live remains a matter of contention, with the album sometimes being called Unleashed in the Studio. Years later, after he had left Priest, Rob Halford noted in various interviews that the music was indeed live, but that his vocals had been ruined in the original recording and were later dubbed in a concert-like studio setting.       Reissues\n\nThe 2001 CD reissue featured four &quot;bonus tracks&quot;, &quot;Rock Forever,&quot; &quot;Delivering the Goods,&quot; &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; and &quot;Starbreaker&quot;, which were only available on the 7&quot; bonus disc that came in the original 1979 Japanese vinyl release. Three of these were from their then-current album &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (Hell Bent For Leather in the US), which was not well represented on the original release.\n\nThese four tracks were previously available on the Japanese pressing of the album (titled Priest in the East and having the same track-list as the remaster), and were recorded at the same time as the original nine tracks. Additionally, two more songs were recorded from the same concerts but were only available as B-sides on various singles: &quot;Evil Fantasies&quot; was on the &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; 12 inch, along with &quot;Delivering the Goods.&quot; &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; was pressed with &quot;Rock Forever&quot; and &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; on a special 3 track live EP that came with initial UK pressings of &quot;Unleashed In The East&quot;. There is also a 1979 UK cassette version with 12 songs: &quot;Rock Forever.&quot; &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; plus the original 9 tracks.\n\nAll the extra songs are fully produced, and are of the same quality as the original nine tracks. Certain bootlegs have turned up with all fifteen tracks put in the original setlist order, to better reflect the actual concerts of the 1979 tour (for the record, all the Unleashed in the East recordings were taken from 2 shows: 10 and 15 February 1979). Two more songs, &quot;White Heat, Red Hot&quot; and &quot;Take on the World&quot; were performed but never officially recorded.\n\nHowever, the &quot;Take On the World&quot; 12 inch single, released in late 1978, included a live version of &quot;White Heat, Red Hot&quot; recorded at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio on 31 May 1978 (on the Stained Class Tour). Live versions of &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; and &quot;Starbreaker&quot; recorded from the same 1978 Cleveland show were released as b-sides to the &quot;Evening Star&quot; 7 inch single and &quot;Take on the World&quot; 12 inch single, respectively. These tracks are available on the Priest, Live and Rare CD. They are not the same versions as on Unleashed in the East. The band was possibly trying to avoid repetition by not including songs on the official full-length live album that were already available as live versions on singles.\nTrack listing\nSide one \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Exciter&quot;   \tRob Halford, Glenn Tipton \t5:38\n2. \t&quot;Running Wild&quot;   \tTipton \t2:53\n3. \t&quot;Sinner&quot;   \tHalford, Tipton \t7:31\n4. \t&quot;The Ripper&quot;   \tTipton \t2:44\n5. \t&quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Pronged Crown)&quot; (Fleetwood Mac cover) \tPeter Green \t3:16\nSide two \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n6. \t&quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot; (Joan Baez cover) \tJoan Baez \t3:30\n7. \t&quot;Victim of Changes&quot;   \tAl Atkins, Halford, K.K.
