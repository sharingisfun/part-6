Whether you are an experienced user of Photoshop, or someone starting out, award-winning photographer, Tony Worobiec, will guide you through the innovative opportunities available to enrich your photos in-computer. Includes 75 creative and inspirational workshops with easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions, detailed screengrabs, and striking before and after photographs. Learn all of the basic techniques, such as making tonal and colour changes, to more complex in-computer image manipulation. Discover how to produce mono photography effects, how to tone images digitally, how to make creative use of filters, how to remove intrusive elements, how to construct panoramas and more. Learn the best image sharpening techniques, how to make composites from two or more files, how to use smart filters and how to add special effects such as sunbeams, rainbows, reflections, shadows and droplets of water. In addition, you will find clever ways to reproduce retro photography techniques, such as recreating the effect of a pinhole or Lomo camera, cross-processing, distressing the image and adding borders and edges. Select workshops individually or apply techniques learned in one workshop with others as your confidence and imagination grows.\n\n\nBy Tony Worobiec\nPublished by David &amp; Charles in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089f684efbcbd66e5a4d69c38123a43ae65c8c8c","amp;dn":"Creative+Photography+Ideas+Using+Adobe+Photoshop%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089f684efbcbd66e5a4d69c38123a43ae65c8c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,159,104,78,251,203,214,110,90,77,105,195,129,35,164,58,230,92,140,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
