She became interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry following a minor role in the 1986 film My Little Girl, to the dismay of her Puerto Rican parents, who believed that it was an unrealistic career route for a Hispanic. Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color in 1991, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. She received her first leading role in the Selena biopic of the same name in 1997. Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn over $1 million for a role the following year, with the film Out of Sight. She ventured into the music industry in 1999 with her debut studio album, On the 6, joining a select few in successfully converting from a film to a music career.\n\nWith the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her film The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first person to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha LÃ¢â‚¬â€œO! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, while her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a Spanish album in the United States. With records sales of 75 million and a cumulative film gross of over $2 billion, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, as well as its highest paid Latin entertainer.[3] As of May 2012, she has an estimated net worth of $250 million.[1]\n\nLopez has used her position as a global icon of pop culture to begin her own empire, consisting of various clothing lines, accessories, fragrances, a production company, television shows and a charitable foundation among other activities. She has established herself as a prominent figure in both the film and music industry, in a career spanning four decades. Lopez's public image and personal relationships have attracted worldwide media attention. Lopez's first high profile relationship was with media mogul Sean Combs, who accompanied her to the 2000 Grammy Awards where she wore the infamous Green Versace dress. She became romantically involved with actor Ben Affleck, while still married to her second husband Cris Judd. Lopez wed long-time friend Marc Anthony in 2004; the couple separated in 2011, after seven years of marriage. Lopez gave birth to their twins, Emme and Maximilian, in February 2008. \n\n\n\n\n\nDance Again... The Hits 2012\n\n\nDance Again... The Hits is the first greatest hits album of American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 17, 2012, by Epic Records, to coincide with the launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former.\n\nDance Again... The Hits comprises eleven previously released tracks and two new recordings: &quot;Dance Again&quot; and &quot;Goin' In&quot;. A deluxe edition of the album was also released, featuring three additional previously released tracks and a DVD featuring a selection of eleven music videos. Dance Again... The Hits received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised it as a reflection of Lopez's success. Some critics expressed their disappointment in the absence of several successful singles, but deemed this as impressive, noting that this may have been due to the large volume of hit singles she has produced over the years. The album was a moderate commercial success, peaking within the top ten in fourteen national charts and the top twenty in ten national charts.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Dance Again&quot; (featuring Pitbull)\n2.\t&quot;Goin' In&quot; (featuring Flo Rida)\n3.\t&quot;I'm Into You&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne)\n4.\t&quot;On the Floor&quot; (featuring Pitbull)\n5.\t&quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;If You Had My Love&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Get Right&quot; (featuring Fabolous)\n9.\t&quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; (Track Masters Remix featuring Styles P. and Jadakiss)\n10.\t&quot;I'm Real&quot; (Murder Remix featuring Ja Rule)\n11.\t&quot;Do It Well&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Ain't It Funny&quot; (Murder Remix featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah)\n13.\t&quot;Feelin' So Good&quot; (Remix featuring Big Pun and Fat Joe)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e67fc98892458785d828fad58c9fe218e16ed25","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Lopez+-+Dance+Again+The+Hits+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e67fc98892458785d828fad58c9fe218e16ed25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,103,252,152,137,36,88,120,93,130,143,173,88,201,254,33,142,22,237,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
