Where their contemporaries built on the legacy of Van Halen, Aerosmith, and Kiss, QueensrÃƒÂ¿che constructed a progressive form of heavy metal that drew equally from the guitar pyrotechnics of post-Van Halen metal and '70s art rock, most notably Pink Floyd and Queen. After releasing a handful of ignored albums, the band began to break into the mainstream with the acclaimed 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime. Its follow-up, Empire, was the group's biggest success, selling over two million copies due to the hit single &quot;Silent Lucidity.&quot; QueensrÃƒÂ¿che never sustained that widespread popularity -- like most late-'80s metal bands, their audience disappeared after the emergence of grunge. Nevertheless, they retained a large cult following well into the ensuing decades. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tMp3 \nBitrate:                CBR 320\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol Records\nCatalog:\t\t509995 02483 22\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Queen Of The Reich\n02.Warning\n03.Walk In The Shadows\n04.Take Hold Of The Flame\n05.The Lady Wore Black\n06.I Don't Believe In Love\n07.Eyes Of A Stranger\n08.Silent Lucidity\n09.Bridge\n10.Jet City Woman\n11.Another Rainy Night (Without You)\n12.Sign Of The Times\n13.I Am I\n14.Real World\n15.Some People Fly\n16.Until There Was You\n17.All The Promises\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Take Hold Of The Flame (Original Demo Version)\n02.Walk In The Shadows (Original Demo Version)\n03.Before The Storm (Original Demo Version)\n04.Waiting For The Kill\n05.No Sanctuary\n06.Prophecy\n07.I Dream In Infrared (1991 Acoustic Remix)\n08.Dirty Lil Secret\n09.Last Time In Paris\n10.Scarborough Fair\n11.Della Brown (MTV Unplugged)\n12.Someone Else  (With Full Band)\n13.Silent Lucidity (Live)\n14.Chasing Blue Sky\n15.Justified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6e3bb68c08e15047c42104204b4930a1362cae8","amp;dn":"Queensryche+-+The+Best+Of+Queensryche++%282007%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6e3bb68c08e15047c42104204b4930a1362cae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,227,187,104,192,142,21,4,124,66,16,66,4,180,147,10,19,98,202,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
