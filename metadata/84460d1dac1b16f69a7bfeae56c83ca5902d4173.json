The format is simple and accessible; all information about one aspect of a topic is set forth on facing pages. For example, the anterior leg muscle is illustrated in a series of precise anatomical drawings and well-lit photos, with text on origin, insertion, action, structure, and how it relates to creating surface form directly opposite the pictures. Unique to this book are photographs of a series of sculptures which show the basic volumes of the figure, revealing the basic principle of the dynamic between the form units of the body. No other artistic anatomy book is so well organized, detailed, and clearly rendered, and its illustrations are of exceptional quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84460d1dac1b16f69a7bfeae56c83ca5902d4173","amp;dn":"Eliot+Goldfinger+-+Human+Anatomy+For+Artists.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84460d1dac1b16f69a7bfeae56c83ca5902d4173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,70,13,29,172,27,22,246,154,123,254,174,86,200,60,165,144,45,65,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
