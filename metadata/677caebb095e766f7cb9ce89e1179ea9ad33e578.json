With the return of their Dial-A-Song service, the band is posting a new track each week to unanimous exclamations of joy from fans old and new. With a toll-free number at (844) 387-6962 and a sweet new web site at dialasong.com, most of the tracks arrive with fully produced animations. A video contest for the lead single ''Erase'' judged by Black Francis of the Pixies is sure to elicit a spectacular original clip.\n\nIn celebration, the band is releasing GLEAN on April 21. It includes 16 songs direct from these first weeks of their Dial-A-Song service. The range of these recordings is truly staggering. From the manic violin-driven ''Music Jail, Pt. 1 &amp; 2'' to the bluesy grinding of ''Underwater Woman,'' Glean comprises some of They Might Be Giants' most vital work of their 30+ year career. With the album, TMBG's sound is in equal turns as rocking, surprising, effervescent, and truly original as they have ever been. The highly anticipated album is produced with long-time collaborator Pat Dillett (St. Vincent, Mike Doughty, Donald Fagen, Mary J. Blige, David Byrne, etc), and comes hot on the heels of 2013 s wildly popular Nanobots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677caebb095e766f7cb9ce89e1179ea9ad33e578","amp;dn":"They+Might+Be+Giants+-+Glean+%5B2015%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677caebb095e766f7cb9ce89e1179ea9ad33e578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,124,174,187,9,94,118,111,124,185,206,137,225,23,158,169,173,51,229,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
