The book focuses on abstract data types as viewed from three different perspectives: their specification, their application, and their implementation. The authors stress computer science theory and software engineering principles, including modularization, data encapsulation, information hiding, data abstraction, object-oriented decomposition, functional decomposition, the analysis of algorithms, and life-cycle software verification methods. Finally, through classic Dale pedagogy students are offered a clear, easy-to-understand discussion of important theoretical constructs and their implementation in C++.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58890e5c77ff49386abe54c836467e2bfe02859","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+Plus+Data+Structures%2C+Third+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58890e5c77ff49386abe54c836467e2bfe02859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,136,144,229,199,127,244,147,134,171,229,76,131,100,103,226,191,224,40,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
