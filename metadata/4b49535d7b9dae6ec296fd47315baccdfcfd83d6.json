Determined to follow her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adviceÃ¢â‚¬â€head up and chin highÃ¢â‚¬â€Lili finds herself in a new city, taking on a new system, this time healthcare. In doing so, she gets something she never expected, an intimate behind-the-scenes look at life in the hospital.\n\nLili learns that a surgeonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands have the power to heal more than physical wounds. And a prescription for truth can cure three years of sleep running and leave you beautifully awake.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b49535d7b9dae6ec296fd47315baccdfcfd83d6","amp;dn":"Riley+Mackenzie%2C+Beautifully+Awake+epub+mobi+2013+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b49535d7b9dae6ec296fd47315baccdfcfd83d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,73,83,93,123,157,174,110,194,150,253,71,49,91,172,205,252,253,131,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
