While not as strong as &quot;The Ring&quot; or &quot;The Coon&quot;, it is still a fairly good episode.Season 13 is having a fairly good run so far, hopefully Trey and Matt keep it up.The episode goes back to spoofing current events.This one spoofs the economic recession that we are currently in.Now that there is a recession, everybody's money is being lost.This starts a wave of different cults, the most popular being the one Stan's dad &quot;Randy&quot; is leader of.They tell everyone to stop spending and buy only basic necessities.The episode starts to mirror the biblical times of Jesus Christ, with Kyle as Jesus.They have the last supper,a &quot;whoever has not sinned cast the first stone&quot; scene, and a scene at the end which could parallel the crucifixion, but not quite.Meanwhile, Stan goes all around to try and return the &quot;Margaritaville&quot; machine his dad bought.He cannot \nreturn it at the original store, so now he has to go all the way to wall \nstreet to do so.He then finds a shocking secret about the businessmen.This is a fairly good episode, has funny moments, though it's not as good as the first two.\n\nals er een probleem is met mijn torrents laat het mij weten\nveel plezier ermee en onthoudt DON'T HIT AND RUN!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8930ece0a3faf9058b3e3c46ba0e35bb2a75205","amp;dn":"South+Park+S13E03+TV+Xvid+%5BNLsubs%5D+-+Margaritaville+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8930ece0a3faf9058b3e3c46ba0e35bb2a75205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,147,14,206,10,63,175,144,88,179,227,196,107,160,227,91,178,167,82,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
