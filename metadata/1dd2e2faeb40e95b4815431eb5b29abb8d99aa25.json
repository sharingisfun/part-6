Previous to the direct route, trains had to travel via BÃ¼chen to join the Berlin-Hamburg railway, a diversion approximately 32km (20 miles) longer than the direct route. \r\n\r\nToday, the Hamburg-LÃ¼beck Railway has the highest passenger numbers in Schleswig-Holstein, and starts out at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, the second busiest station in Europe. On departure, the route heads north-east through the suburbs of Hamburg, crossing connecting lines to Hannover, Berlin, Harburg and Hamburg Airport. \r\n\r\nBetween Hamburg-Rahlstedt and Ahrensburg, the line runs alongside the Stellmoor tunnel valley, and at Bad Oldesloe, the line connects with hourly services to Bad Segeberg and NeumÃ¼nster, making it the most important intermediate stop on the line. From Bad Oldesloe, the line heads east to Reinfeld before turning north into LÃ¼beck Hauptbahnhof. \r\n\r\nStandard services on the line are usually formed of a DB BR 143 or DB BR 218 hauling double decker coaches and the S-Bahn uses DB BR 474.3s, with Regionalbahn services operated by DB BR 648s. ICE TD and IC3 units also run on the route, although since the construction of the Great Belt Bridge between Funen and Zealand, long-distance rail traffic has significantly reduced on the route. \r\n\r\nStarting in 2017, upgrades to the Hamburg to Bad Oldesloe section will see new stations at ClaudiusstraÃŸe, BovestraÃŸe, Holstenhofweg and Pulverhof for S-Bahn operations. \r\n\r\nThe Hamburg-LÃ¼beck Railway route add-on for Train Simulator includes a number of prototypical rolling stock, including the DB BR 145 electric locomotive, DB BR 218 diesel hydraulic locomotive and DBAG Class 294 diesel freight shunter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL NOT WORK ON LEGIT TRAIN SIMUALTOR 2016!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd2e2faeb40e95b4815431eb5b29abb8d99aa25","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG+Hamburg+Lubeck+Route%2BDB+BR+474.3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd2e2faeb40e95b4815431eb5b29abb8d99aa25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,210,226,250,235,64,233,91,72,21,67,30,181,178,154,187,141,153,170,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
