Instead, our everyday knowledge is reintroduced to the language of design. Design values of 'space' are challenged and informed to stimulate a new theoretical and practical approach to design.\n\nThis book views architectural and urban spaces as psychological, social and partly cultural phenomena. They accommodate, separate, structure, facilitate, heighten and even celebrate human spatial behaviour. \n\n* Helps to reconnect your everyday implicit knowledge with your professional conceptual knowledge\n* Gain a greater understanding of clients by questioning the values you commonly hold\n* Promotes easier communication by taking the abstract idea of 'space' and placing it in real terms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135556944133df2ab1a9895e59c319db1c0cfaca","amp;dn":"The+Language+of+Space+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135556944133df2ab1a9895e59c319db1c0cfaca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,85,86,148,65,51,223,42,177,169,137,94,89,195,25,219,28,12,250,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
