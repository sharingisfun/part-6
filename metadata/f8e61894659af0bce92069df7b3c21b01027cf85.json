After two decades of running from this cinematic disaster, the cast can no longer hide from the legion of followers that celebrate them for their ineptitude.\n\nBEST WORST MOVIE, directed by TROLL 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s once-disgraced child star, Michael Paul Stephenson, unravels the stories of these unforgettable real-life characters and the colorful army of devotees who continue to revel in the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly flawed brilliance.\n\nAt the center of this celebrated documentary is the improbable story of a small-town Alabama dentist-turned-cult-movie-icon, and an Italian filmmaker who come to terms (or doesn't) with his internationally revered cinematic failure.\n\nBEST WORST MOVIE is an affectionate and intoxicatingly fun tribute to the single greatest bad movie ever made and the people responsible for unleashing it on the world. The result is a hilarious and tender offbeat journey that pays homage to lovers of bad movies and the people who make them, while investigating a deeper story about the strange nature of celebrity, the catharsis of redemption and the humanity that exists in making even the worst movie ever made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e61894659af0bce92069df7b3c21b01027cf85","amp;dn":"Best+Worst+Movie+%5B2010%5D+Making+of+TROLL+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e61894659af0bce92069df7b3c21b01027cf85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,230,24,148,101,154,240,188,233,32,105,223,123,60,33,176,16,39,207,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
