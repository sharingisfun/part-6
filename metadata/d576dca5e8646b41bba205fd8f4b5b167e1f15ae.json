As their career progressed, Madness branched away from their trademark &quot;nutty sound&quot; and incorporated large elements of Motown, soul, and British pop. Although the band managed one crossover American hit in 1983, they remained a British phenomenon, influencing several successive generations of musicians and becoming one of the most beloved groups the country produced during the '80s.\r\n\r\nRead the rest here: [url]http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madness-mn0000195874/biography[/url]\r\n\r\nMadness - 1979 - One Step Beyond...\r\nMadness - 1979 - One Step Beyond...
