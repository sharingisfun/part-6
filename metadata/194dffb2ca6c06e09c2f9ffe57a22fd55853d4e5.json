It was recorded during his 1978 world tour and is composed mostly of the artist's &quot;greatest hits&quot;. The performances in the album are radically altered from the originals, using the same musicians that backed Street-Legal, but relying on a much larger band and stronger use of brass and backup singers. In some respects the arrangements are more conventional than the original arrangements and the album was criticized for being so. At the same time that it was criticized for being too polished, it was criticized for being too sloppy. For a few critics, such as Janet Maslin of Rolling Stone, the differences between the older and newer arrangements had become less important.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc One\n\n \t&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;   \t4:54\n \t&quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot;   \t4:30\n \t&quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;   \t3:52\n \t&quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;   \t4:47\n \t&quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot;   \t4:55\n \t&quot;Maggie's Farm&quot;   \t5:06\n \t&quot;One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)&quot;   \t3:19\n \t&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;   \t6:31\n \t&quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;   \t4:12\n \t&quot;Is Your Love in Vain?&quot;   \t4:02\n \t&quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;   \t4:22\n\nDisc Two\n\n \t&quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;   \t4:25\n \t&quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;   \t5:03\n \t&quot;Oh, Sister&quot; (Bob Dylan, Jacques Levy) \t4:44\n \t&quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot;   \t4:15\n\t&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;   \t3:20\n \t&quot;I Want You&quot;   \t2:34\n \t&quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;   \t3:37\n \t&quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot;   \t4:00\n \t&quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;   \t6:04\n \t&quot;Forever Young&quot;   \t5:38\n \t&quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot;   \t5:31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194dffb2ca6c06e09c2f9ffe57a22fd55853d4e5","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+At+Budokan+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194dffb2ca6c06e09c2f9ffe57a22fd55853d4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,77,255,178,202,108,6,224,156,47,159,254,87,162,47,213,88,83,212,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
