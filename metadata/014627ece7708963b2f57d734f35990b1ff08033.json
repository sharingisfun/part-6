The artist's input is usually considered a good thing, but in this case it has resulted in an idiosyncratic selection that fails to be representative or to cull the real highlights from Raitt's Warners catalog. Basically, that catalog breaks down into three sections -- the first three solid albums, the second three good but uneven albums, and the last three mediocre, compromised albums. Raitt has opted to try to find at least a couple of tracks from each album, which means she necessarily slights her best work in favor of her weakest. Even by choosing four tracks from Give It Up, she still misses &quot;Been Too Long at the Fair,&quot; and by restricting herself to two tracks from Takin My Time, she misses &quot;Cry Like a Rainstorm&quot; and &quot;I Gave My Love a Candle.&quot; On later albums, the problem is more about selection than quantity. Why &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; from Home Plate and not &quot;Run Like a Thief&quot; and &quot;I'm Blowin' Away&quot;? Why &quot;(Goin') Wild for You Baby&quot; from The Glow and not the Grammy-nominated &quot;You're Gonna Get What's Coming&quot;? Why &quot;Will ya Wont cha&quot; from Green Light and not &quot;Me and the Boys&quot;? Even taking into account differences in taste, Raitt's choices run in the face of the preferences of fans and \n critics to the point that the album fails to make the case for her Warners recordings  as true expressions of her talents, a case that could have been made decisively with  a better selection. -- William Ruhlmann \n \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Finest lovin' man [03:59] \n 02.Give it up or let me go [04:30] \n 03.Women be wise [03:24] \n 04.Under the falling sky [03:43] \n 05.Love me like a man [03:12] \n 06.Love has no pride [03:49] \n 07.I feel the same [04:40] \n 08.Guilty [03:00] \n 09.Angel from montgomery [04:01] \n 10.What is success [03:30] \n 11.My first night alone [03:03] \n without you \n 12.Sugar mama [03:46] \n 13.Louise [02:45] \n 14.About to make me leave home [04:15] \n 15.Runaway [03:56] \n 16.The glow [04:11] \n 17.(goin') wild for you baby [05:26] \n 18.Willya wontcha [03:22] \n 19.True love is hard to find [03:39] \n 20.No way to treat a lady [03:52] \n ____ \n \n 76:03 min \n 107,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014627ece7708963b2f57d734f35990b1ff08033","amp;dn":"Bonnie_Raitt-The_Bonnie_Raitt_Collection-%28Retail%29-1990-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014627ece7708963b2f57d734f35990b1ff08033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,70,39,236,231,112,137,99,178,245,125,115,79,53,153,11,31,240,128,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
