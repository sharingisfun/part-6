Led by vocalist Chad Kroeger, the band initially emerged in the late '90s as Canada's answer to Creed, prizing a blend of gruff vocals and distorted (yet radio-friendly) guitars. After a handful of singles failed to gain much traction in Canada, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; caught hold in 2001, eventually topping the charts in several countries while gathering four Grammy nominations and four Juno Awards. Creed imploded several years later, but Nickelback's popularity only grew as the decade progressed, effectively eclipsing those acts that had once informed the band's sound.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t21386-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.95% CDDA &amp; 99.90% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Something In Your Mouth\n02.Follow You Home\n03.Never Again\n04.Gotta Be Somebody\n05.Photograph\n06.How You Remind Me\n07.Someday\n08.Hero\n09.Just For\n10.Animals\n11.Never Gonna Be Alone\n12.Because Of You\n13.Breathe\n14.If Everyone Cared\n15.Too Bad\n16.Feelin' Way Too Damn Good\n17.Leader Of Men\n18.Rockstar\n19.Throw Yourself Away\n20.Left\n21.Deep\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Shakin' Hands\n02.Side Of A Bullet\n03.Savin' Me\n04.I'd Come For You\n05.Wake Up This Morning\n06.Slow Motion\n07.If Today Was Your Last Day\n08.Do This Anymore\n09.Old Enough\n10.Believe It Or Not\n11.Hollywood\n12.Cowboy Hat\n13.Far Away\n14.See You At The Show\n15.Should've Listened\n16.Saturday Night's Alright\n17.Flat On The Floor\n18.Good Times Gone\n19.Figured You Out\n20.Curb\n21.Little Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d8c8d352bc2e3ae5f5d5b6db2dd34a1c4c6d8c","amp;dn":"Nickelback+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d8c8d352bc2e3ae5f5d5b6db2dd34a1c4c6d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,216,200,211,82,188,46,58,229,245,213,182,219,45,211,74,28,76,109,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
