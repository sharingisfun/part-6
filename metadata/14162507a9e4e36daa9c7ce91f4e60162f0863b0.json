Guide a group of survivors through the mayhem -- hiding from hellspawn and building a safe haven. The game combines a base economy simulation with tactical combat missions; you survive by crafting equipment, defending your base and sending teams to scavenge for supplies.\r\n\r\nYou must strike a balance between rebuilding and scavenging a devastated world for supplies and information. You must help the survivors with basic needs and also invest time in research to craft advanced equipment. Dabble in the occult to gain an advantage, but beware: Everything comes with a price","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14162507a9e4e36daa9c7ce91f4e60162f0863b0","amp;dn":"Judgment%3A+Apocalypse+Survival+Simulation+v0.5.1776","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14162507a9e4e36daa9c7ce91f4e60162f0863b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,22,37,7,169,228,227,109,170,156,124,233,31,78,96,22,47,8,99,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
