The characters are multi-dimesional and it's difficult to get bored. The humor is overwhelmingly funny at times and keeps the story moving at a very good pace. The story alone makes this a must-have but throw in Tarentinos wit and ability and you have an instant classic, somthing that doesen't come around that often.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9249cc9c4f39ce421c33d0bf7f9411b412b96ed","amp;dn":"Pulp+Fiction%3A+A+Quentin+Tarantino+Screenplay+%28Iradins%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9249cc9c4f39ce421c33d0bf7f9411b412b96ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,36,156,201,196,243,156,228,33,195,61,11,247,249,65,27,65,43,150,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
