The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By the time of the centenary of HergÃƒÂ©'s birth in 2007, Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.\n\nThe series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in Le Petit VingtiÃƒÂ¨me, a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le VingtiÃƒÂ¨me SiÃƒÂ¨cle. The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper Le Soir and spun into a successful Tintin magazine. In 1950, HergÃƒÂ© created Studios HergÃƒÂ©, which produced the canonical series of twenty-four Tintin albums. The Adventures of Tintin have been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.\n\nThe series is set during a largely realistic 20th century. Its hero is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in the original French edition). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash and cynical Captain Haddock, the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (French: Professeur Tournesol), and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (French: Dupont et Dupond) and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore.\n\nThe series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in HergÃƒÂ©'s signature ligne claire (&quot;clear line&quot;) style. Its well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of sophisticated satire and political or cultural commentary.&quot;\n\nYeah...if you're a comic fan, these are must-reads, period.
