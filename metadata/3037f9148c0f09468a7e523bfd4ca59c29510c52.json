Go for it! :D\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nCore Clinical Cases guides you to think of the patient as a whole, rather than as a sequence of unconnected symptoms. With its practical approach strongly linked to underlying theory, the series integrates your knowledge with the realities of managing clinical problems, and provides a basis for developing problem-solving skills. \n\nThe core areas of undergraduate study are covered in a logical sequence of learning activities: each is followed by a detailed answer, along with a number of short-answer questions to help you practice for examinations in the first two to three years of your course. Mechanisms showing the pathogenesis of a disease process and explanations of the clinical findings and laboratory investigations have been included.\n\nThis book provides a highly structured case history text covering each of the important components of the undergraduate biomedical sciences, in the form of 45 clinical scenarios. Each scenario is followed by eight to ten questions and answers with detailed feedback.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3037f9148c0f09468a7e523bfd4ca59c29510c52","amp;dn":"Core+Clinical+Cases+in+Basic+Biomedical+Science+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3037f9148c0f09468a7e523bfd4ca59c29510c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,55,249,20,140,15,9,70,138,126,82,59,253,76,165,156,41,81,12,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
