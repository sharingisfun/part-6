He prefers what dealers call HPC itemsâ€”high-profile collectiblesâ€”but when he manages to obtain a collection of letters written by Fidel Castro between 1960â€“62 to a secret girlfriend, it's not a matter of money anymore. Garcia has stumbled way out of his depth.\r\n\r\nFirst Garcia disappears, and then the man to whom he sold the letters. When Doc Ford begins to investigate, he soon becomes convinced that those letters contain a secret that someone, or some powerful agency, cannot allow to be made public.\r\n\r\nA lot happened between Cuba and the United States from 1960â€“62. Many men died. A few more will hardly be noticed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3605e1dab63646898e748696bdb1f73d5087bd","amp;dn":"CUBA+STRAITS+-+Randy+Wayne+White.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3605e1dab63646898e748696bdb1f73d5087bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,54,5,225,218,182,54,70,137,142,116,134,150,189,177,247,61,80,135,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
