Although they each are presented with a real opportunity to leave the village, the sisters choose to stay with their father, to serve to him and their church. After some years, a French woman refugee, Babette, arrives at their door, begs them to take her in, and commits herself to work for them as maid/housekeeper/cook. Sometime after their father dies, the sisters decide to hold a dinner to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth. Babette experiences unexpected good fortune and implores the sisters to allow her to take charge of the preparation of the meal. Although they are secretly concerned about what Babette, a Catholic and a foreigner, might do, the sisters allow her to go ahead. Babette then prepares the feast of a lifetime for the members of the tiny church and an important gentleman related to one of them.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           :Babettes.Gaestebud.1987.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 142 Kbps\nLength            : 5.15 GiB for 1h 43mn 9s 583ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : da\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092603&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092603&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage:  Danish | Swedish | French\nSubtitles: English (in mkv), Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c41cf72b0d139bc51c41df53cd475e791afeb1f","amp;dn":"Babettes.Gaestebud.1987.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c41cf72b0d139bc51c41df53cd475e791afeb1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,65,207,114,176,209,57,188,81,196,29,245,60,212,117,231,145,175,235,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
