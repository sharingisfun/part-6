A marketing technology stack is the set of tools that your marketing team uses to plan, execute, and measure all aspects of your marketing objectives. With the explosion of new capabilities, vendors, and technologies in this space, it's more important than ever to carefully choose your components and build the stack that's right for your organization. In this course, Dave Booth walks you through a framework that examines the roles and benefits of each &quot;layer&quot; in the stackâ€”acquisition through marketing and advertising, digital experiences and clickstream measurement, the back office functions, and analysis. Learn how these technologies can help you drive engagement, measure results, increase sales, and improve customer relationships.â€¨â€¨NOTE: While specific software and platforms aren't endorsed, you will see how tools like a customer relationship management system and web analytics work in a successful marketing mix.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWhat is digital marketing?\r\n\tâ€¢\tUnderstanding the marketing data being generated\r\n\tâ€¢\tReaching customers via digital channels like social, search, and display \r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with digital experiences\r\n\tâ€¢\tSelling online with ecommerce\r\n\tâ€¢\tGoing mobile\r\n\tâ€¢\tMeasuring and optimizing with testing and analytics\r\n\tâ€¢\tRunning and operating a business with technology\r\n\tâ€¢\tStoring and extracting data\r\n\tâ€¢\tLearning and predicting with data exploration and modeling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e01c70422506439b299f451411c33632856506","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+Your+Marketing+Technology+Stack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e01c70422506439b299f451411c33632856506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,224,28,112,66,37,6,67,155,41,159,69,20,17,195,54,50,133,101,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
