A remake of the Cuban classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“El Son Te LlamaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is sung by Medoune Diallo, a Pirates Choice vocalist. \nThe band revives great older Baobab songs like &quot;On Verra Ãƒâ€¡a&quot; and &quot;Ndongoy Daara,&quot; brings in a few folk tunes, and rounds out the album with strong new material. &quot;Homage A Tonton Ferrer&quot; is a rollicking vocal tour de force featuring Cuba's Ibrahim Ferrer and N'Dour.\n \nMoreover, the band is tight throughout.\n\n\n\nCD / 2002 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
