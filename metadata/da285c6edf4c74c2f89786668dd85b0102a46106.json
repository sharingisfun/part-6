Colonel Potter, Sergeant Klinger, and Father Mulcahy find themselves together once again, this time at a veteran&amp;#039;s hospital.\n\n\nThis is the show &quot;After MASH&quot; which only ran for one and less then a half of a second season. There is a total of 29 shows. The last episode (29th one) has never been show to this day. I am missing the next to the last episode, which is the 28th show (02x08). I found these for sale (lol!) on iOffer for $12 for four DVDs. Someone bought them and uploaded the 4 WHOLE DVDs. I downloaded them, encoded them in Xvid format and split them into files. The quality is alright, not good enough though that would justify selling them for any ammout on an auction site! The last episode (02x07) even has the VCR time, counter and the word play at the top of the screen for the entire episode! Even though the quality isn&amp;#039;t great, it&amp;#039;s good enough if you want to see these great shows since they are not available on DVD and probably won&amp;#039;t be anytime soon or ever.\n\nI am also including W*A*L*T*E*R which is a pilot that was never picked up but it was shown as a CBS special July 17th 1984.\n\nIMDB #tt0203189\nAfter Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&amp;#039;Reilly returns home from Korea, he joins the local police force. His adventures include tracking his stolen wallet, breaking up a fight between two strippers, and helping out a homeless boy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da285c6edf4c74c2f89786668dd85b0102a46106","amp;dn":"After+MASH+All+Episodes+-+AfterMASH+-+WALTER+Pilot+%2F+CBS+Special","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da285c6edf4c74c2f89786668dd85b0102a46106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,40,92,110,223,76,116,194,248,151,134,102,141,216,91,1,2,164,97,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
