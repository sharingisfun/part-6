Production for the album took place during 2002 to 2003 and was handled by Winehouse, Salaam Remi, Commissioner Gordon, Jimmy Hogarth, and Matt Rowe. Its title alludes to the nature and tone of Winehouse's lyrics on the album.\n\nUpon its release, Frank received generally positive reviews from most music critics and earned Winehouse several accolades, including an Ivor Novello Award. Since its original release in the United Kingdom, the album has been reissued in Canada, the United States, and Australia. It has been certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, with shipments in excess of 900,000 copies in the UK.\n\n\nMuch can be said about Amy Winehouse, one of the U.K.'s flagship vocalists during the 2000s. The British press and tabloids seemed to focus on her rowdy behavior and heavy consumption of alcohol, but fans and critics alike embraced her rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals. Her platinum-selling breakthrough album, Frank (2003), elicited comparisons ranging from Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan to Macy Gray and Lauryn Hill. Interestingly enough, despite her strong cockney accent and vernacular, one can often hear aspects of each of those singers' vocal repertoire in Winehouse's own voice. Nonetheless, her allure has been her songwriting -- almost always deeply personal, but best-known for its profanity and brutal candor. - http://www.allmusic.com/album/frank-r671986\n\nReview\n\nby John Bush\n\nIf a series of unfortunate comparisons (like the ones to follow) cause listeners to equate British vocalist Amy Winehouse with Macy Gray, it's only natural. Both come on like a hybrid of Billie Holiday and Lauryn Hill who's had a tipple and then attempted one more late-night set at a supper club than they should have. Despite her boozy persona and loose-limbed delivery, though, Winehouse is an excellent vocalist possessing both power and subtlety, the latter an increasingly rare commodity among contemporary female vocalists (whether jazz or R&amp;B). What lifts her above Macy Gray is the fact that her music and her career haven't been marketed within an inch of their life. Instead of Gray's stale studio accompaniments, Winehouse has talented musicians playing loose charts behind her with room for a few solos. Instead of a series of vocal mellifluities programmed to digital perfection, Winehouse's record has the feeling of being allowed to grow on its own -- without being meddled with and fussed over (and losing its soul in the process). Simply hearing Winehouse vamp for a few minutes over some Brazilian guitar lines on &quot;You Sent Me Flying&quot; is a rare and immense pleasure. Also, like Nellie McKay (but unlike nearly all of her contemporaries), Winehouse songs like &quot;Fuck Me Pumps,&quot; &quot;Take the Box,&quot; and &quot;I Heard Love Is Blind&quot; cast a cool, critical gaze over the music scene, over the dating scene, and even over the singer herself. With &quot;In My Bed,&quot; she even proves she can do a commercial R&amp;B production, and a club version of &quot;Moody's Mood for Love&quot; not only solidifies her jazz credentials but proves she can survive in the age of Massive Attack. - http://www.allmusic.com/album/frank-r671986/review\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n1-1.1 Intro 3:55\nProducer, Recorded By, Mixed By - Commissioner Gordon\n\n\n1-1.2 Stronger Than Me\nOrgan - Salaam Remi\n\n\n1-2.1 You Sent Me Flying 6:51\nPercussion - Salaam Remi\nPiano, Bass, Keyboards - Luke Smith\nWritten-By - Felix Howard\n\n\n1-2.2 Cherry\nDrum Programming, Mixed By - Salaam Remi\n\n\n1-3 Know You Now 3:03\nDrums - Errol Campbell (2)\nProducer, Recorded By, Programmed By, Mixed By - Commissioner Gordon\nShaker - Rudy Bird\nWritten-By - Astor Campbell , Gordon Williams\nWritten-By, Bass - Delroy &quot;Chris&quot;
