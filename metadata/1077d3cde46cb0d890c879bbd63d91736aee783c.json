YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mesmerizing performance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the Free WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ planted the seeds of a new song in HarperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind, compelling him to go straight back to his room after the show and write ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll Is Free.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The incident is emblematic of the kind of urgency with which the new album was forged.\n\nHarper recorded most of Give Till ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ his first solo record since 2006ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Both Sides of the Gun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at the Los Angeles studio of Jackson Browne, who harmonizes with him on the wistful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPray That Our Love Sees The Dawn.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The album also features two tracks co-written with Ringo Starr ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the exuberant, psychedelic-tinged ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpilling FaithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet There From Here,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ an improvisational instrumental. Starr, who also plays drums on the songs, tapped Harper for his 2010 album, Y Not.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never made a record that was such a timeline,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Harper. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a real extension of the last year and half in my life, and all these sounds are inspired by my experiences. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as honest a musical statement as I could make.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWith Give Till ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gone, Harper examines the disparity between the man he is today and the man he endeavors to become. Reaching deep within, he discovers there are no easy answers, but implores us to go the distance with him on this journey in the moving album opener, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Give Up On Me Now.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ While its songs are highly personal, Give Till ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gone illuminates the universal struggle to find meaning and fully engage with life and one another. We may pass through a dark night of the soul, but giving up is not a viable option, as Harper reminds us with certainty in the transcendent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Will Not Be Broken.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHarper made his debut in 1994 with Welcome to the Cruel World, which was subsequently certified Gold. In 2005, he received GRAMMY awards for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Pop Instrumental PerformanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for his single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ11th CommandmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Traditional Soul Gospel AlbumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for There Will Be A Light, featuring the Blind Boys of Alabama. His three most recent studio albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Both Sides of the Gun (2006), Lifeline (2007) and White Lies for Dark Times (2009) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ debuted in the Top 10 of The Billboard 200.
