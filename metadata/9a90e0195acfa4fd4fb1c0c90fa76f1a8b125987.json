The latest lucky patcher will not patch link2sd correctly.\n\nInstall the latest version of Link2SD from the play store.\n\nLucky Patcher has a working patch for version 3.5.2. Run it, select Link2SD, Patches, Custom Patch. Apply the patch, you should get a 70% patch success. Then launch Link2SD and all features should be unlocked.\n\nNote that on my kitkat phone the function to &quot;Create Link&quot; and selecting to Link App Data, the fourth option, causes some programs to run very slowly. Angry Birds Go works well, with all data linked, but sometimes crashes.
