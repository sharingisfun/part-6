BeksiÃ…â€žski did his paintings and drawings in what he called either a 'Baroque' or a 'Gothic' manner. His creations were made mainly in two periods. The first period of work is generally considered to contain expressionistic color, with a strong style of &quot;utopian realism&quot; and surreal architecture, like a doomsday scenario. The second period contained more abstract style, with the main features of formalism.\n\nBeksinski was murdered in 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f45a7f241224bac06d874826a4787d6c2f1d0f","amp;dn":"Utopian+Art+by+Zdislaw+Beksinski+1929-2005+%28Art+Paintings+nrg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f45a7f241224bac06d874826a4787d6c2f1d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,244,90,127,36,18,36,186,192,109,135,72,38,164,120,125,108,47,29,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
