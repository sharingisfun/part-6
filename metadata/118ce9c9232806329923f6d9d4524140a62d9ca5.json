But after a few more listens, the record Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second LP as a solo artist and 45th (!) as producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ begins to function like his Nashville- based Third Man Records and novelties storefront: with each visit, one notices more strangely enticing details that reveal an understated genius similar to that of some literary treasure like the The Great Gatsby.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost worth breaking the album down line-by-line as you would that novel, because every little detail might be packed with deeper meaning. Consider the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alleged backstory: It was his longest production process to date (1.5 years), he conquered writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s block by pulling characters and lyrics from one-page short stories and plays written after his first brush with love as a 19-year-old (half his current age of 38), and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in true legend-forging fashion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he destroyed the original works afterward.\n\nEven more fascinating are his somewhat cryptic dedications in the liner notes to three women: Florence Green, the last-surviving WWI veteran when she died at 110 years old in 1992, Voltairine de Cleyre, a Michigan-bred anarchist and Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmazingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Grace Hopper, a WWII computer science pioneer who coined the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“debuggingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by literally removing a moth from a computer to make it work. Given those, it would be absurd to assume that opening the disc with the Blind Willie McTell re-work Ã¢â‚¬Å“Three WomenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is just a coincidence.n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118ce9c9232806329923f6d9d4524140a62d9ca5","amp;dn":"Jack+White+-+Lazaretto+%282014%29+%5BEAC%5D+Third+Man+Records+MP3%40320kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118ce9c9232806329923f6d9d4524140a62d9ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,140,233,201,35,40,6,50,153,35,246,217,212,82,65,64,166,45,156,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
