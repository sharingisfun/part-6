Jeannie Gunn leaves her genteel Melbourne\nexistence for a new life on her husband&amp;#039;s isolated cattle station.\nRolling up her sleeves and mucking in, Jeannie soon wins over the misogynistic\nstockmen, but she faces a much tougher challenge in trying to change their racist\ntreatment of the indigenous aboriginal population.\n\nEnjoy the movie!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5f08a6ad284605ff27760033b98624b9a93ecb","amp;dn":"We+Of+The+Never+Never+%5B1982%5D+%5BEng%5D+-Hammer71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5f08a6ad284605ff27760033b98624b9a93ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,95,8,166,173,40,70,5,255,39,118,0,51,185,134,36,185,169,62,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
