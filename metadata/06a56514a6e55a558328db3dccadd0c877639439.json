Impressive even. Definatly worth the download if you havn't heard any of the songs.\n\nIf you have heard is Hard White (the reason I thought he was shit), the rest of the songs are nothing like that.  Most have a little meaning behind it too.  So take a listen atleast, you won't regret it.\n\nEncoding:\nAAC M4A Format\nSource: CD\n256 Kbps\n44100Hz\nCompatible: With Android phones (I have the Samsung Galaxy SII), ofcourse iPods, and any other AAC M4A compatible formats.\n\nTracks:\n1.
