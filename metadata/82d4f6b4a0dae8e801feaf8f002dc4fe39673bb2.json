Their music is generally psychedelic/ stoner-rock with kraut-rock elements.\n\n&quot;Causa Sui is Latin, meaning something that is generated from within itself, it's own cause, and it's mostly applied to the God concept. My midnight guess is that these Danes (3 now, 4 in the beginning of their days together in 2004) apply it to the way they generate music, from deep within themselves both individually and as a group. They've had lots of practice: although they're only in their early and mid-twenties, they've been jamming together since\nbefore they were teens, and it gives them a remarkable maturity for players so young.\n\nCausa Sui is not the hipsterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unintelligent 60ies-look nostagia music, not a scholarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad search for the most complex of compositions, nor a neanderthal take on sludgy riffs. This is free music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all written, shaped, played and produced by the band during 9 months of isolation.\n\nImagine the furious haze of manic Hendrix and Blue Cheer jamming with a young Iggy Pop, recorded and seamlessly layered by krautrockers Can. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untamed music picked up from the late 60s, not looking back at zeitgeists and other limitations, picking up different trails on the way, wrapped in a complex, but soundwise warm and simple jacket.&quot;\n\nBand Members:\n\nJonas Munk - Guitars/Keys/Electronics/Vocals\nJess Kahr - Bass\nJakob SkÃƒÂ¸tt - Drums &amp; Percussion\n\nDiscography:\n\n2005.Causa Sui\n2007.Free Ride\n2008.Summer Sessions Vol.1\n2009.Summer Sessions Vol.2\n2009.Summer Sessions Vol.3\n2011.PewtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢r Sessions 1\n2011.PewtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢r Sessions 2\n2013.Euporie Tide\n2014.Live At Freak Valley\n2014.PewtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢r Sessions 3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d4f6b4a0dae8e801feaf8f002dc4fe39673bb2","amp;dn":"Causa+Sui+-+Pewt.r+Sessions+3++mp3++++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d4f6b4a0dae8e801feaf8f002dc4fe39673bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,212,246,180,160,218,232,232,1,254,175,143,0,45,196,254,57,103,59,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
