In the process of making such an argument, Vonnegut presents the autobiography of a failed abstract expressionist and his spiritual and creative journey out of the darkness and back to the light of the world of human beings and human-based art. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84f1bcb45f9e2e473291434c61b928d00e7dbe9c","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+Bluebeard+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84f1bcb45f9e2e473291434c61b928d00e7dbe9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,241,188,180,95,158,46,71,50,145,67,76,97,185,40,208,14,125,190,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
