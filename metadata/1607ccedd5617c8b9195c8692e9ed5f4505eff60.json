It was actually released on DVD, but with such a small run that it is generally thought that it never was. Even a used original DVD can cost hundreds of dollars.\n \n - Not my rip/encode. I found it elsewhere, but I think it should be here too. It's passable but I would have made the resolution a little higher. I'd re-encode it myself, but see above. ;^)\n\n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1607ccedd5617c8b9195c8692e9ed5f4505eff60","amp;dn":"Black+Like+Me+%281964%29+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1607ccedd5617c8b9195c8692e9ed5f4505eff60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,7,204,237,213,97,124,139,145,149,200,105,46,158,213,244,80,94,255,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
