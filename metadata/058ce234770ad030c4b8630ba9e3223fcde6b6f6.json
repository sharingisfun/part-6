Pretty much the workprint for the 'Incal' saga and Ridley Scotts 'Blade runner'\n\nWorth noting: O'bannon and Moebius, along with Gieger, formed the team Jodorowsky recruited to to realize a movie based on 'Dune'. When the project failed, Gieger and O'Bannon were hired by Riddley Scott to help him realize the first 'Alien' movie, while Moebius and Jodorowsky started working on 'The Incal'.\n\nwiki: &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; is the title of a short story comic written by Dan O'Bannon around 1975 or 76, and illustrated by Moebius. The storytelling of &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; is inspired by film noir and hardboiled crime fiction, but the story is set in a distant, science fiction future, making it one of the first true cyberpunk stories. The comic came to the attention of Ridley Scott and was a key visual reference for Blade Runner.\nIt was originally serialised in two segments in the French magazine Metal Hurlant in 1976 and later by the American magazine Heavy Metal in Vol. 1 No. 4 and Vol. 1 No. 5 published in July 1977 and August 1977 respectively. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tomorrow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058ce234770ad030c4b8630ba9e3223fcde6b6f6","amp;dn":"Dan+O%5C%27Bannon+%26+Moebius+-+The+Long+Tomorrow+%281977%29+%5BCBZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058ce234770ad030c4b8630ba9e3223fcde6b6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,140,226,52,119,10,208,48,196,184,99,11,169,227,34,63,205,230,182,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
