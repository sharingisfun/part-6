Under her guidance, the Eternal Word Television Network grew at a staggering pace, both in viewership and in influence, to where it now reaches over a hundred million viewers in hundreds of countries around the globe.\r\nRaymond Arroyo combines his journalistâ€™s objectivity and eye for detail with more than five years of exclusive interviews with Mother Angelica. He traces Mother Angelicaâ€™s tortured rise to success and exposes for the first time the fierce opposition she faced, both outside and inside of her church.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02941306d199d221e35c2bb16067dc638860363","amp;dn":"Mother+Angelica%3A+The+Remarkable+Story+of+a+Nun%2C+Her+Nerve%2C+and+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02941306d199d221e35c2bb16067dc638860363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,41,65,48,109,25,157,34,30,53,194,187,22,6,125,198,56,134,3,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
