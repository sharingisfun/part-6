Michel went to America seven years ago and promised to return when he became rich. In Michel's absence, Lola is being courted by her childhood friend Roland (Marc Michel) and American sailor Frankie (Allan Scott). At some point, it seems that Lola will settle down with one of them, but her heart still belongs to Michel. The film is dedicated to Max OphÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ls and the film title obviously alludes to OphÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ls' Lola Montes as well as to the heroine of Josef Von Sternberg's The Blue Angel. Marc Michel makes a reference to his unrequited love towards Lola when he reappears in Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964). \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055093/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055093/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-15320&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-15320&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:25\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 672x288  2.33:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1045 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,23 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 74 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8669eb6a8fc7e9e445389be2d31c3cf24c35245c","amp;dn":"Lola+%281961%29+Anouk+Aimee+Fr%2CEngsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8669eb6a8fc7e9e445389be2d31c3cf24c35245c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,105,235,106,143,199,233,228,69,56,155,226,211,28,60,242,76,53,36,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
