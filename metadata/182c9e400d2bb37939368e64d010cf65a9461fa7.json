She's aware of a struggle within herself, an inexplicable pull toward danger, but it isn't until she turns sixteen and meets the alluring Kaidan Rowe that she discovers her terrifying heritage and her willpower is put to the test. He's the boy your daddy warned you about. If only someone had warned Anna.\n\nForced to face her destiny, will Anna embrace her halo or her horns?\n\nBook 2: Sweet Peril (The Sweet Trilogy #2) by Wendy Higgins (April 30th 2013)\n\nAnna Whitt, the daughter of a guardian angel and a demon, promised herself sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never do the work of her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€polluting souls. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been naive to make such a vow. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been naive about a lot of things. \n\nHaunted by demon whisperers, Anna does whatever she can to survive, even if it means embracing her dark side and earning an unwanted reputation as her schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s party girl. Her life has never looked more bleak. And all the while thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kaidan Rowe, son of the Duke of Lust, plaguing her heart and mind.\n\nWhen an unexpected lost message from the angels surfaces, Anna finds herself traveling the globe with Kopano, son of Wrath, in an attempt to gain support of fellow Nephilim and give them hope for the first time. It soon becomes clear that whatever freedoms Anna and the rest of the Neph are hoping to win will not be gained without a fight. Until then, Anna and Kaidan must put aside the issues between them, overcome the steamiest of temptations yet, and face the ultimate question: is loving someone worth risking their life?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182c9e400d2bb37939368e64d010cf65a9461fa7","amp;dn":"The+Sweet+Trilogy+%281-2%29+by+Wendy+Higgins+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182c9e400d2bb37939368e64d010cf65a9461fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,44,158,64,13,43,179,121,57,54,142,100,208,16,207,101,169,70,31,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
