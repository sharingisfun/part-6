He quickly found guitarist ZoltÃƒÂ¡n MarÃƒÂ³thy, T. PÃƒÂ©ter KovÃƒÂ¡cs on bass, and Zsolt GalÃƒÂ¡ntai on drums. The band was fully formed by 1986, and they played their concert on July 13th. They were famous just as much for their insane multi-coloured outfits as for their music, eschewing the traditional chains and leather for harlequin suits.\n\nIn October, 1986, they recorded their first demo, following it up with a second in May, 1987. They opened for international touring acts Pretty Maids, Helloween, and U.D.O. in 1987. In 1988, KovÃƒÂ¡cs was conscripted into the army, and Laci PalvÃƒÂ¶lgyi took over on bass. In 1988, the first album was released, and they opened for none other than Iron Maiden. The ``Heart of Steel`` music video featured a lot of footage of the band hanging out with Iron Maiden, and in fact, in the ``Maiden England`` video, Adrian Smith can be seen wearing an Ossian t-shirt!\n\nAfter the second album, PÃƒÂ¡lvÃƒÂ¶lgyi and GalÃƒÂ¡ntai left, being replaced by GÃƒÂ¡bor VÃƒÂ¶rÃƒÂ¶s on bass and ZoltÃƒÂ¡n Nagyfi on drums. His brother happened to be LÃƒÂ¡szlÃƒÂ³ Nagyfi of PokolgÃƒÂ©p, and in fact Nagyfi left to join his brother in Omen in 1991, and in came Csaba Tobola.\n\nThis lineup recorded five albums, before internal tensions, especially between Paksi and MarÃƒÂ³thy, caused the band to break up. They performed a farewell concert on May 14th, 1994.\n\nMarothy went on to form Fahrenheit, and Paksi formed Wellington, and also wrote some crime novels in English under the pseudonym Paul Trent!\n\nIn 1998, Paksi recruited a new lineup to perform one concert, which was recorded for a live album, and then Ossian decided to call the reformation permanent, and they have released four more full albums and an EP since then.\n\nBand from left to right:\nAttila WÃƒÂ©ber, Viktor Jakab, Endre Paksi, RichÃƒÂ¡rd Rubcsics, PÃƒÂ©ter HornyÃƒÂ¡k\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fa4214f2b0676ce1e0d807e444222bbd5fe954","amp;dn":"OSSIAN%28Hungarian+Heavy+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fa4214f2b0676ce1e0d807e444222bbd5fe954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,250,66,20,242,176,103,108,225,224,216,7,228,68,34,43,189,95,233,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
