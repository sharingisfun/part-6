In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead Americas finest to victory in the West, but also place you in command of German forces charged with repelling the Red Armys seemingly unstoppable offensive in the East. Even the keenest military minds will find that its one thing to make history, but quite another to change it. Do you have what it takes to command.\n\n\nOriginal credit goes to the original uploader and remember to seed...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142a775cbfc5d0456e571dc445fd07594c919ad3","amp;dn":"Order+Of+War+%5BEnglish%5D%5BPCDVD%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142a775cbfc5d0456e571dc445fd07594c919ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,42,119,92,191,197,208,69,110,87,29,196,69,253,7,89,76,145,154,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
