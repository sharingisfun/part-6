Having grown up American with a Tibetan influence, he speaks to Westerners as no one can: relating stories and wisdom from American culture and the great Buddhist teachers in idiomatic English. Strengthening, calming, and stabilizing the mind is the essential first step in accomplishing nearly any goal. Turning the Mind Into an Ally makes it possible for anyone to succeed.
