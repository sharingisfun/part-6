Smart II. (This trio did, indeed, tour under the name Mountain shortly after the album's release, even performing at Woodstock, though Smart was replaced by Corky Laing and Steve Knight was added as keyboard player for the formal recording debut of the group, Mountain Climbing!, released in February 1970.) Pappalardi had been Cream's producer, and that power trio, as well as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, were the models for this rock set, which was dominated by West's throaty roar of a voice and inventive blues-rock guitar playing. Though West had led the Vagrants for years and cut a handful of singles with them, this was his first album release, and it made for an auspicious debut, instantly establishing him as a guitar hero and setting the style of Mountain's subsequent recordings. [Originally released in July 1969 as Windfall 4500, Mountain was reissued on CD on April 16, 1996, as Columbia/Legacy 66439.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:288940b8bd287f41e2547d68f8e8dbe462c8f40e","amp;dn":"Leslie+West+-+Mountain+%5B1969%5D++%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"288940b8bd287f41e2547d68f8e8dbe462c8f40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,137,64,184,189,40,127,65,226,84,125,104,248,232,219,228,98,200,244,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
