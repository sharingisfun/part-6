The band will do anything to make you notice. Steady, consistent drum beats, free of flashy fills, keep you focused on that guitar whirl, and high-pitched sound effects, which sound as if they could have come off a vintage Atari video game, accentuate it.\n\nFAKE CAN BE JUST AS GOOD, the band&amp;#039;s third album, finds Unwound bassist Vern Rumsey filling in for the departed Maki Takahashi, and Rumsey&amp;#039;s deep bellows strike a neat balance with those shrieking guitars. Together, they build jagged rhythms, which they can transform into steady riffs in the blink of an eye.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1968f73977b8f4e14cafd5706d52527158891a4d","amp;dn":"Blonde+Redhead+-+Fake+Can+Be+Just+as+Good","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1968f73977b8f4e14cafd5706d52527158891a4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,104,247,57,119,184,244,225,76,175,213,112,109,82,82,113,88,137,26,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
