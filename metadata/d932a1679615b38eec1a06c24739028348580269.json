The book describes the human brain as a machine that can understand hierarchical concepts ranging from the form of a chair to the nature of humor. His important insights emphasize the key role of learning both in the brain and in AI. He provides a credible road map for achieving the goal of super-human intelligence, which will be necessary to solve the grand challenges of humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d932a1679615b38eec1a06c24739028348580269","amp;dn":"How+to+Create+a+Mind_+The+Secret+of+Human+Thought+Revealed+by+Ra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d932a1679615b38eec1a06c24739028348580269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,50,161,103,150,21,179,142,236,26,6,194,71,57,2,131,72,88,2,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
