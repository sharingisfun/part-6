In addition, as most modern engineers are required to study software, material suitable for Software Engineering - set theory, predicate and prepositional calculus, language and graph theory - is fully integrated into the book.\n\nExcessive technical detail and language are avoided, recognising that the real requirement for practising engineers is the need to understand the applications of mathematics in everyday engineering contexts. Emphasis is given to an appreciation of the fundamental concepts behind the mathematics, for problem solving and undertaking critical analysis of results, whether using a calculator or a computer.\n\nThe text is backed up by numerous exercises and worked examples throughout, firmly rooted in engineering practice, ensuring that all mathematical theory introduced is directly relevant to real-world engineering. The book includes introductions to advanced topics such as Fourier analysis, vector calculus and random processes, also making this a suitable introductory text for second year undergraduates of electrical, electronic and computer engineering, undertaking engineering mathematics courses.\n\nThe book is supported by a comprehensive website at http:www.bh.com/companions/075065855X, featuring:\n* plotXpose software (for equation solving, and drawing graphs of simple functions, their derivatives, integrals and Fourier transforms)\n* over 60 pages of &quot;Background Mathematics&quot; reinforcing introductory material for revision purposes in advance of your first year course\n* problems and projects (linking directly to the software)\n* a complete worked solutions manual (password protected)\n\nDr Attenborough is a former Senior Lecturer in the School of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering at South Bank University. She is currently Technical Director of The Webbery - Internet development company, Co. Donegal, Ireland.\n\n* Fundamental principles of mathematics introduced and applied in engineering practice, reinforced through over 300 examples directly relevant to real-world engineering\n* Over 60 pages of basic revision material available to download in advance of embarking on a first year course\n* Companion website featuring complete solutions manual, plotXpose software, and further problems and projects enabling students to build on the concepts introduced, and put the theory into practice\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56116433bae2caa46e9b2d12ff7709c24c585fa","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+Electrical+Engineering+and+Computing+-+%28Malestro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56116433bae2caa46e9b2d12ff7709c24c585fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,97,22,67,59,174,44,170,70,233,178,209,47,247,112,156,36,197,133,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
