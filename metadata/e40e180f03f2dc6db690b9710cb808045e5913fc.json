Ludwig\n2008 | 144 Pages | ISBN: 1592534260 | PDF | 82 MB\n\nFeaturing the artwork of over 25 leading artists with name recognition\nAs art journaling grows in popularity (even attracting a new breed of scrapbookers who call themselves &quot;life artists&quot;), there is a movement afoot toward creating more authentic, personal, what some people call &quot;raw&quot; journals. These journals are filled with not just attractive, well-composed pages, but pages that are filled with personal, meaningful content.\nTrue Visions is focused on ways to bring authenticity and meaning into one's art journaling. The book will examine themes and topics common to all while offering activities and exercises to create rich meaningful content. Each chapter will highlight familiar subject areas such as life events, spirituality, childhood, and even an artist's favorite writings. Within each topic, readers are given guided activities and exercises for developing content, provided one or two artistic techniques, and are shown inspiring examples of work by a variety of talented art journal artists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40e180f03f2dc6db690b9710cb808045e5913fc","amp;dn":"True+Vision+-+Authentic+Art+Journaling+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40e180f03f2dc6db690b9710cb808045e5913fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,14,24,15,3,242,220,109,182,144,185,113,12,184,8,4,94,89,19,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
