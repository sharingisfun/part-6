He was adopted as an infant;[1] his adoptive father was a firefighter. When he was eight months old, Healey lost his sight to retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eyes. His eyes had to be surgically removed, and he was given artificial replacements.\n\nHealey began playing guitar when he was three, developing his unique style of playing the instrument flat on his lap. When he was 17, he formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece band which primarily played bar-band cover tunes. Among the other musicians were bassist Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and a schoolmate, Rob Quail on second guitar. This band played various local clubs in Toronto, including the Colonial Tavern.\n\nHealey began hosting a jazz and blues show on radio station CIUT-FM where he became known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm gramophone records.[2]\n\nShortly thereafter he was introduced to two musicians, bassist Joe Rockman and drummer Tom Stephen, with whom he formed a trio, &quot;The Jeff Healey Band&quot;. This band made their first public appearance at the Birds Nest, located upstairs at Chicago's Diner on Queen Street West in Toronto. They received a write-up in Toronto's NOW magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman's Tavern and the famed blues club Albert's Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert Collins).\n\nAfter being signed to Arista Records in 1988, the band released the album See the Light, featuring the hit single &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and the song &quot;Hideaway&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. While the band was recording See the Light, they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the Patrick Swayze film Road House.[3] Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the Juno Award for Canadian Entertainer of the Year. The albums Hell to Pay and Feel This gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a cover of The Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps which featured George Harrison and Jeff Lynne on backing vocals and acoustic guitar\n\nBy the release of the 2000 album Get Me Some, Healey began to concentrate his talent in another direction closer to his heart, which was the appreciation for another original American music form, jazz.\n\nHe went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances.\n\nHealey was an avid record collector and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 78 rpm records. He had, from time to time, hosted a CBC Radio program entitled My Kind of Jazz, in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He hosted a program with a similar name on Toronto jazz station CJRT-FM; as of 2010, the latter program continues to air in repeats.\n\nHe had also been touring with his other group, The Jazz Wizards, playing American hot jazz. (At the time of his death, they had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands in April 2008.)\n\nFor many years, Healey performed at his club, &quot;Healey's&quot; on Bathurst Street in Toronto, where he played with &quot;The Healey's House Band&quot; on Thursday nights and with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened &quot;Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.&quot; Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, Road House, in which Healey appeared.)\n\nOver the years, Healey toured and sat-in with many legendary performers, including Dire Straits, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, BB King, ZZ Top, Steve Lukather, Eric Clapton and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan's CD/DVD Gillan's Inn.\n\nHealey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including Terra Hazelton and Amanda Marshall.[5]\n\nIn early 2009, Healey's album Mess of Blues won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, Healey underwent surgery to remove metastatic tissue from both lungs. In the previous eighteen months, he had two sarcomas removed from his legs.[7]\n\nOn March 2, 2008, Healey died of cancer[8] at St. Joseph's Health Centre in his home town of Toronto.[9] He was 41 years old. His death came a month before the release of Mess of Blues, which was his first rock/blues album in eight years.[10]\n\nHealey is survived by his wife, Cristie, and two children.[11] A tribute concert was held on May 3, 2008, to benefit Daisy's Eye Cancer Fund, which, according to Cristie Healey, had helped make major strides in research and future advances for people born with the same genetically inherited retinoblastoma[12] which had plagued her husband since he was one year of age. Cristie and Jeff Healey's son was also born with the same disability.[13]\n\nIn 2009, he was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee The Light 1988\n\n\n\nSee the Light is the debut album by The Jeff Healey Band. It was released on September 13, 1988. It was #50 of the top 100 albums in Canada in 1989.[2] In 1990 it was nominated for an &quot;Album of the Year&quot; Juno Award.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Confidence Man&quot; \n2.\t&quot;My Little Girl&quot; \n3.\t&quot;River of No Return&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Don't Let Your Chance Go By&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Angel Eyes&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Nice Problem to Have&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Someday, Someway&quot; \n8.\t&quot;I Need to Be Loved&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Blue Jean Blues&quot; \n10.\t&quot;That's What They Say&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Hide Away&quot; \n12.\t&quot;See the Light&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad House 1989\n\n\n\nRoad House is a 1989 American action film partially based on the life of Norman &quot;Storm&quot; Cantwell, directed by Rowdy Herrington and starring Patrick Swayze as a bouncer at a newly-refurbished roadside bar who protects a small town in Missouri from a corrupt businessman.[2] Sam Elliot also plays a bouncer, the friend of and foil to Swayze's character. The cast also includes Kelly Lynch as Swayze's love interest, and Ben Gazzara as the main antagonist.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; - The Jeff Healey Band\n2.\t&quot;Blue Monday&quot; - Bob Seger\n3.\t&quot;I'm Tore Down&quot; - The Jeff Healey Band\n4.\t&quot;These Arms of Mine&quot; - Otis Redding\n5.\t&quot;When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky&quot; - The Jeff Healey Band\n6.\t&quot;Rad Gumbo&quot; - Little Feat\n7.\t&quot;Raising Heaven (In Hell Tonight)&quot; - Patrick Swayze\n8.\t&quot;A Good Heart&quot; - Kris McKay\n9.\t&quot;(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; - The Jeff Healey Band\n10.\t&quot;Cliff's Edge&quot; - Patrick Swayze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel This 1992\n\n\n\nFeel This is the third album by The Jeff Healey Band.

It was released in 2008 less than two months after his death and just three weeks shy of his 42nd birthday. Four of the albums tracks were recorded live in front of audiences, two of the live tracks at the Islington Academy in London, and the other two live tracks at Jeff Healey's Roadhouse in Toronto. The other six tracks were recored at Studio 92 in Canada by Norm Barker and Richard Uglow. The whole album features the band which normally accompanied Jeff at his club, Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I'm Torn Down&quot; - 5:23\n2.\t&quot;How Blue Can You Get&quot; - 8:54\n3.\t&quot;Sugar Sweet&quot; - 3:46\n4.\t&quot;Jambalaya&quot; - 4:00\n5.\t&quot;The Weight&quot; - 4:26\n6.\t&quot;Mess O' Blues&quot; - 3:24\n7.\t&quot;It's Only Money&quot; - 3:10\n8.\t&quot;Like A Hurricane&quot; - 6:39\n9.\t&quot;Sittin' On Top Of The World&quot; - 7:07\n10.\t&quot;Shake, Ratte And Roll&quot; - 4:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs From The Road 2009\n\n\n\nSongs from the Road is a posthumous released live blues album by Jeff Healey. It was released in July, 2009. This album was released over a year after his death, and contains hits and covers. As noted by one reviewer, &quot;...the blind musician will be remembered best for playing searing guitar on his lap, looking like a pedal steel guitar man gone mad. Songs from the Road...captures Healey's gift for energizing rock and blues tunes with powerful, sometimes blistering guitar work. It's a talent that occasionally sneaks up on the listener.&quot; \n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Think I Love You Too Much&quot;- 5:40\n2.\t&quot;I'm Ready&quot;- 5:22\n3.\t&quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;- 5:58\n4.\t&quot;Angel Eyes&quot;- 5:55\n5.\t&quot;Come Together&quot;- 5:23\n6.\t&quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;-7:10\n7.\t&quot;White Room&quot;- 5:36\n8.\t&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;- 5:14\n9.\t&quot;Whipping Post&quot;- 5:59\n10.\t&quot;Teach Your Children Well&quot;- 2:49\n11.\t&quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me&quot;- 2:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Call 2010\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n01.
