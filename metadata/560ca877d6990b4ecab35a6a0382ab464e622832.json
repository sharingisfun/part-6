Check. Propulsive percussion? Absolutely. Rally-cry lyrics? Of course. The Hives' signature sound comes to bear in this inspired Nike+ Original Remix.  Pulling elements from The Hives' smash hit The Black and White Album, the production duo, Expensive People, craft a completely new running adventure.  This 45-minute journey begins with a steady warm-up and then allows the runner to find his/her stride before culminating in a fast-paced, high-energy explosion.   The run closes with a restorative cool-down and leaves fans with a newfound appreciation for this iconic Swedish rock band.\n\nRunners take their cues from the changes in tempo, instinctively picking up the pace when the music intensifies, catching a breather as the beats slow down.  You can use Black, White and Run for tempo runs or simply as motivation to add a few bursts of speed to your regular runs.  Elements from &quot;Tick Tick Boom&quot;, &quot;Try It Again&quot;, &quot;Won't Be Long' and others show up in this audio odyssey, delivering the vocals you love remixed to create the ultimate runner's companion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560ca877d6990b4ecab35a6a0382ab464e622832","amp;dn":"Nike+Original+Run-+The+Hives-+Black%2C+White%2C+and+Run+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560ca877d6990b4ecab35a6a0382ab464e622832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,12,168,119,214,153,11,78,202,179,90,106,3,130,171,70,78,98,40,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
