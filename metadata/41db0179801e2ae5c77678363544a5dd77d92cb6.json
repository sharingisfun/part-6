The film is extremely comprehensive and shot in a confrontational, intimate style. Kaye, who made the critically praised, provocative indie feature American History X, doesnÃƒÂ¢??t shy away from his subject or his subjects. Filmed in tight close-ups, individuals on both sides of the issue are given enough time to explain their beliefs. Some of the most compelling commentary comes from clinic workers who found themselves the victims of terrorist acts initiated by the religious right. It also presents Norma McCorvey, the real-life Jane Roe who has had a startling change of heart and now spends her time speaking out against abortion. Explicit in its material, the film contains a short anti-abortion propaganda film in which a young womanÃƒÂ¢??s ten-week-old fetus is aborted, as well as other graphic depictions of the procedure. Be warned that these scenes are quite disturbing, regardless of your feelings about the issue. Lake of Fire demonstrates how Roe v. Wade changed the lives of millions of American women. The tide, it appears, may be turning. This provocative film is sure to stir the fire within anyone who cares about human rights.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41db0179801e2ae5c77678363544a5dd77d92cb6","amp;dn":"Lake+of+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41db0179801e2ae5c77678363544a5dd77d92cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,219,1,121,128,30,42,229,199,118,120,54,53,68,165,221,119,217,44,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
