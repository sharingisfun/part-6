Korn began their existence as the Bakersfield, CA-based metal band LAPD, which included guitarists James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer and Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy Snuts&quot; Arvizu, and drummer David Silveria. After issuing an LP, the members of LAPD in 1993 crossed paths with Jonathan Davis, a mortuary science student moonlighting as the lead vocalist for the local group Sexart. They soon asked Davis to join the band, and upon his arrival the quintet rechristened itself Korn.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Blind\n02.Got The Life\n03.Here To Stay (Clean Version)\n04.Did My Time\n05.Good God (Explicit)\n06.Dead Bodies Everywhere\n07.A.D.I.D.A.S.
