These syndicates have revolutionized how the consumer\ninteracts with the digital world. Since the consumer requires a device to access the world's data\nand control technology, they can do this in the blink of an eye via neural chip implant.\nCivilians flocked to be &quot;Chip'd&quot; and enjoy all that their selected syndicate has to offer: housing,\nmedical, banking, insurance, education, entertainment and jobs. One complete package. One complete\nlifestyle. In return, the syndicates gained unprecedented insights, and control, over the individual\nand their behavior. With little government oversight, business has become war. \nThe syndicates will stop at nothing for ultimate market dominance.\n\nAt the first line of this war are the agents, the syndicate's bio-engineered and chip-augmented enforcers.\nThey can breach anything in the wired dataverse, including their enemies, their weapons and the\nenvironment that surrounds them, making them the most efficient and deadly technological weapons in\nthe world. Take on the role of Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest prototype agent, and embark on a brutal\naction adventure of corruption and revenge.\n\nDeveloper: Starbreeze AB\nPublisher: EA\nGenre: Action-FPS Shooter\nPlatform: PC / Windows\nProtection: EA Core,Securom\nCracked By: 3DM\nGame language: English\n\nMinimum requirements:\n\nIntel Core2 Duo (E4600) at 2.4Ghz or equivalent (Athlon 64 x 2) processor\nATI Radeon 4650 or Nvidia GeForce 8800GT (min. 512mb RAM) or better\nWindows XP SP2 with 2Gb RAM, Vista with 3Gb RAM .7 with 2Gb RAM\nHard drive with 12Gb free space\nDirectX compatible sound card, and microphone for VoIP\nDirectX 9.0c compatible - SHADER 3.0 compliant\n\nInstallation:\n\n1.
