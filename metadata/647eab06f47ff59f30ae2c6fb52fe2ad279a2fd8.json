Plus itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilariously funny, ribald, sexy and brilliant.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Liz Smith\n\nIn The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Hollywood, bestselling author and legendary bad-boy screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tells everything he knows about the industry, its players and screenwriting itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€from the first blank sheet of paper in the Olivetti to the size of the credit on the one-sheet.\n\nOften practical and always entertaining, The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Hollywood distills everything one of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most accomplished screenwriters knows about the business, from writing advice to negotiation tricks, from the wisdom of past players to the feuds of current ones. Eszterhas has selected his personal pantheon of the most loved and loathed players in the business and treats the reader to a treasure trove of stories, quotes and wisdom from those luminaries, who include William Goldman (loathes) and Zsa Zsa Gabor (loves). \n\nThe DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Hollywood could only have been written by someone who loves the business as much as Eszterhas doesÃ¢â‚¬â€but who also has its number.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Eszterhas delivers a dishy, catty mix of reminiscences and Hollywood triviaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦his forte is skewering sycophants and phonies in this opinionated showcase of the underside of Hollywood life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:647eab06f47ff59f30ae2c6fb52fe2ad279a2fd8","amp;dn":"The+Devil%26rsquo%3Bs+Guide+to+Hollywood+-+Joe+Eszterhas+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"647eab06f47ff59f30ae2c6fb52fe2ad279a2fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,126,171,6,244,127,245,159,48,174,44,111,181,47,226,173,39,154,47,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
