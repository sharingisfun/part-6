In a 1999 interview, he described his grandmother as &quot;his greatest love&quot; who &quot;multiplied many things to bring up this responsible individual that I am today.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7e3a26c26bbe83b684b24fc7d8d9589407539d","amp;dn":"Lucky+Dube+-+Father+To+Son+2014+%7Bby+gtyouth%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7e3a26c26bbe83b684b24fc7d8d9589407539d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,126,58,38,194,107,190,131,182,132,178,79,199,216,217,88,148,7,83,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
