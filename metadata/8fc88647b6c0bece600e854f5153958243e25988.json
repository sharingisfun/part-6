Audioslave*\n2. Out Of Exile\n3. Revelations\n\nFour Singles/EPs**\n4. Cochise\n5. Like A Stone EP\n6. Be Yourself (Australian Single)\n7. Doesn't Remind Me\n\nlive albums/EP's\n8. Live In Cuba (audio)\n9. Sessions@AOL***\n10. Live EP****\n\nBootlegs/Unofficial\n11. Civilian Project (Demos)\n12. KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas\n13. Covers &amp; Rare#\n\n*Note1: Bonus track &quot;Give&quot; included. This track was a bonus download, or iTunes \n bonus.\n\n**Note2: Singles include only the content that is unique to the single, in other \n  words, no duplicated tracks. The other tracks are just elsewhere in this discog.\n\n***Note3: Not the 3 track version that was a best buy bonus, but the 5 track version, the 5 include the 3 from Best Buy bonus disc, and is the whole session. The 5 track also came with the deluxe of &quot;Live In Cuba&quot;\n\n****Note4: Not to be confused with the self-titled DVD-EP, the difference is it contained the 3 videos they had made so far, and 2 live tracks, the same 2 live tracks are on this 4 track EP.\n\n#Note5: Only 1 track here, the rest are already here, or not available (at least in my searching)\n\nEnjoy!\nHMD3\n\nPS. Please help seed this well, as some of this came from very poorly seeded/tracked torrents. And while this upload isn't all mine, I believe I'm the 1st to put it all together.\n\nThanks to CanadaJoe for the BBC track that was hard to find.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc88647b6c0bece600e854f5153958243e25988","amp;dn":"Audioslave+Discog+%5B320kbps%5D%5BHMD3%5D+COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc88647b6c0bece600e854f5153958243e25988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,200,134,71,182,192,190,206,96,14,133,79,81,83,149,130,67,226,89,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
