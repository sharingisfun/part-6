It may be that it is actually closer in tone to the 2008 opera, but it contains almost nothing of the Afro-Caribbean/Yoruba angle that works as a sort of &quot;counter-narrator&quot; in the novel and which the opera apparently foregrounded.  It winds up being, as the negative review posted below suggests, a conventional romance. As that reviewer says, Hidalgo's film has some great imagery but it wasn't audacious enough and (in my view) doesn't wind up realizing a sound adaptation of what Gabriel GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rquez was fabricating in his novel. Still, the film has merits as a kind of &quot;show-piece&quot; for what Hidalgo can do with images which isn't negligible.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Del amor y otros demonios.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,097,814,016 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:38:55\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x360 (AR: 1.778)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1278 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.231 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206479/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206479/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Spanish\nSubtitles: Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nThanks to chispawell @ clan-sudamerica.net for the rip!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c7579de67136ebc77ce5b85df1e71d39f1555e0","amp;dn":"Hilda+Hidalgo+-+Del+amor+y+otros+demonios+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c7579de67136ebc77ce5b85df1e71d39f1555e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,117,121,222,103,19,110,188,119,206,91,133,223,30,113,211,159,21,85,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
