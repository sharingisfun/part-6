Godefroy (Jan 24, 2008) \n\nISBN 0090668209  \n\nPDF\n\n1.49 MB \n\n\n\nThe term mind power and the subconscious mind power are described in many different ways. In the psychosomatic sense mind power is labeled as ability to have emotions, imagination, memory, and will; and subconscious mind power is labeled as part of the normal individual?s personality in which mental processes function without consciousness under normal waking conditions. \n\nThe question then arises of what to do when negative thoughts or images about yourself do arise, which they inevitably will. Cybernetics has the answer: a servomechanism will attain its objective both by trying - and failing - to do so. Failures are examined and analyzed, and the necessary corrections are made. Negative past experiences, ingrained in our memory, do not necessarily inhibit the functioning of this servomechanism, but can actually contribute to the process of learning.\n\nErrors should be seen as stages on the road to success. Once they are properly analyzed, mistakes can be used to help us. Once they have served their purpose, you can forget them. The worst thing you can allow yourself to do is think, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI failed in the past, therefore I will fail in the future.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.......................\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ea876081dab4877dfb9793ccf182e7a4b5281a","amp;dn":"Mind+Power%3A+How+To+Use+And+Control+Your+Unlimited+Potentials-Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ea876081dab4877dfb9793ccf182e7a4b5281a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,234,135,96,129,218,180,135,125,251,151,147,204,241,130,231,164,181,40,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
