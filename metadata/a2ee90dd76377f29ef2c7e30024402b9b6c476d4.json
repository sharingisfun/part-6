As the moving spirit of De Stijl, the most austere\nof all abstractionist movements, Mondrian developed and carried out his idea of art almost in isolation ; he owed little to any other artist or school of painting. The pure geometrical works of his mature style, often composed entirely of squares of vivid reds and yellows carefully balanced with areas of white and intersected by vertical or horizontal lines, are the direct expression of his belief in an art freed from subjectivityÃ¢â‚¬â€an art that was the expression of a universal unchangeable truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2ee90dd76377f29ef2c7e30024402b9b6c476d4","amp;dn":"Mondrian+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2ee90dd76377f29ef2c7e30024402b9b6c476d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,238,144,221,118,55,127,41,239,44,126,48,2,68,2,185,182,196,118,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
