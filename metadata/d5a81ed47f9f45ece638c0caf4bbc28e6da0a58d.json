These drawings follow rules laid down in national and international standards. The organisation responsible for the international rules is the International Standards Organisation (ISO). There are hundreds of ISO standards on engineering drawing because drawing is very complicated and accurate transfer of information must be guaranteed. The information contained in an engineering drawing is a legal specification, which contractor and sub-contractor agree to in a binding contract. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a81ed47f9f45ece638c0caf4bbc28e6da0a58d","amp;dn":"Engineering+Drawing+for+Manufacture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a81ed47f9f45ece638c0caf4bbc28e6da0a58d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,168,30,212,127,159,69,236,230,56,192,202,244,187,194,142,109,160,165,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
