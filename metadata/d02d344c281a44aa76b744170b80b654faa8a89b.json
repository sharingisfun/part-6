But secret intelligence is the BureauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first and foremost mission. Enemies is the story of how presidents have used the FBI as the most formidable intelligence force in American history.\n \nHere is the hidden history of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hundred-year war on terror. The FBI has fought against terrorists, spies, anyone it deemed subversiveÃ¢â‚¬â€and sometimes American presidents. The FBIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret intelligence and surveillance techniques have created a tug-of-war between protecting national security and infringing upon civil liberties. It is a tension that strains the very fabric of a free republic.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02d344c281a44aa76b744170b80b654faa8a89b","amp;dn":"Enemies-+A+History+of+the+FBI+-Tim+Weiner+%5Bepub%5D+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02d344c281a44aa76b744170b80b654faa8a89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,45,52,76,40,26,68,170,118,183,68,23,11,128,182,84,250,168,168,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
