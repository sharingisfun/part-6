They've played and recorded together on a number of occasions since then, joined by Ray Brown more often than not, but these live tracks recorded at the Blue Note are among their most satisfying sessions. Peterson continues his strong comeback from the serious stroke that he suffered in 1993, replacing his once ferocious tempos with an uncanny lyricism. Brown's introduction to &quot;Blues for JR&quot; and his bass solo medley are superb, while Jackson remains a master of the blues. The finale of &quot;Caravan&quot; features drummer Karriem Riggins and brings the session to a thunderous climax. Highly recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Ja-da\n02. SKJ\n03. I Remember Clifford\n04. When Summer Comes\n05. Blues for JR\n06. Nature Boy\n07. Sometimes I'm Happy\n08. Bass Solo Medley: Full Moon and Empty Arms / The Very Thought of You / The Work Song\n09. Caravan\n\nPersonnel:\nOscar Peterson - piano\nRay Brown - bass\nMilt Jackson - vibes\nKarriem Riggins - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0911e420d6f9d9c73b321a3e0e6cba889d56b733","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson%2C+Ray+Brown%2C+Milt+Jackson+-+1999+-+The+Very+Tall+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0911e420d6f9d9c73b321a3e0e6cba889d56b733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,17,228,32,214,249,217,199,59,50,26,62,14,108,186,136,157,86,183,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
