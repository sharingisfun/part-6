As part of a marketing test you get to evaluate this killer copywriting system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ free!\n\nNo, this isn't some junk mass-distributed fill-in-the-blank sales letter template masquerading as a copywriting course.\n\nIt's the same step-by-step process one high-paid copywriter turns to when creating sales copy for his clients.\n\nNow you can churn out your own killer web copy and sales letters without the need to pay $15,000, $10,000 or even $5,000 per-project to hire a copywriter to write your next sales letter for you.\n\nHow Is This Course Different?\n\nMost copywriting course fall into one of two categories... both doomed to failure.\n\n\n    The first category of so-called &quot;courses&quot; is nothing more than instructions to walk through a series of steps for  completing a generic pre-written sales letter template. The authors often claim, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjust paste in your name and your product and you're ready to go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (why reinvent the wheel when all the writing has been done for you already?)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n    The problems with this approach are too numerous to list here. For a start, though, the letters always come across as insincere when the receiver reads the letter, and realizes the letter is a template used by many different people. The letter goes into the trash or the net 'surfer' quickly clicks away to another site.\n\n    Generic sales letter templates NEVER work because they are missing the secret &quot;R&quot; ingredient. With your permission I'm going to give you a series of videos that teach how to profit from the secret &quot;R&quot; ingredient other business owners and marketing executives never consider.\n\n\nThe second category of &quot;courses&quot; contain hundreds of pages of 'rules'. Once you read these rules you are left on your own to figure out how to apply those rules to what you are promoting or selling. A big waste of time!\n\nWith our course, &quot;How To Write Sales Copy Like A Pro...' we bridge the gap between those failed approaches. You get exact steps that others pay thousands of dollars to have professional copywriters do for them.\nWhy would a high-paid copywriter give you access to his closely guarded copywriting processes for free?\n\nThe answer is simple.\n\nBecause we are testing a new concept that many people are praising right now... the law of reciprocation. Basically we want to see how well our company increases by helping hundreds of business owners just like you to immediately start increasing your business ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ free.\n\nThe 4-week online copywriting training course will be released to the public on May 02, 2010.
