In the first episode, a new international criminal investigative unit is being formed under Thea Nellemann (Ghita NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rby), and Hallgrimsson (Jens Albinus) is persuaded to take the job as the lead investigator for the unit. He puts together a small team of experts in their fields. Their cases cross the borders between Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Russia and various other countries; and involve biker gangs, former Russian KGB, possible terrorist threats and international fraud. Throughout the series Hallgrimsson deals with recurring flashbacks and possibly post-traumatic stress from a childhood incident.\n\nThere are English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ed3d83bd8a278ff577aa1a770bb6d663cb619d","amp;dn":"The+Eagle+%28Ornen%3A+en+Krimi-Odysse%29+%28Multisub%29+-S1-+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ed3d83bd8a278ff577aa1a770bb6d663cb619d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,237,61,131,189,138,39,143,245,119,170,26,119,11,182,214,99,203,97,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
