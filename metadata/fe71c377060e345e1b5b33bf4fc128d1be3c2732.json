The album was produced by Dan Grech-Marguerat and was inspired in part by his work with New York indie band The Vaccines, with Keane aiming for a more back-to-basics sound based on songwriting rather than production. Strangeland features the single 'Silenced by the Night'.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe71c377060e345e1b5b33bf4fc128d1be3c2732","amp;dn":"Keane+-+Strangeland+%282012%29+%40+320KB%2Fs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe71c377060e345e1b5b33bf4fc128d1be3c2732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,113,195,119,6,14,52,94,27,91,51,191,79,193,40,209,190,60,39,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
