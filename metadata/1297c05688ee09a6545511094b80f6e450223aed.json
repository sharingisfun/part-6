The more that science learns from those events, the more we find that modern climate change resembles them. We seem to be engineering change to our planet potentially as destructive as any in the past.\nYour Life as Planet Earth takes readers on a lighthearted journey through the twists and setbacks of our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution, using the metaphor of a human life to make the story of our world and its climate easily relatable. It shows how the strands of climate, evolution, tectonics and cosmic events tangled through time to drive changes in life and climate to today.\nWe canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully grasp how we came to be without understanding the climate shifts and rocky upheavals that led to us. We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make sense of our future until we make sense of our past.\n\nAbout the Author\nHoward Lee is a freelance Earth Science writer and blogger on past climates. He earned his B.Sc in Geology and his M.Sc in Remote Sensing at the University of London, and he is a Fellow of the Geological Society of London (FGS). Howard draws upon years of experience in diverse Earth Science industries (seismic hazard, geothermal exploration, mining and radioactive waste disposal, oil and gas exploration) for his writing. He decided to write Your Life as Planet Earth after a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon with his son's Boy Scout troop. In explaining the geological wonders that unfolded around them every day, he realized there was a need to present the story of the planet in an approachable way, connecting the past to the world of today, particularly with respect to climate change. His other interest is Ancient Persia, and his first book for children: Jamshid and the Lost Mountain of Light, earned Howard a &quot;Persian Golden Lioness Award&quot; as Best Children's Book. Howard is a Kenya-born British-American who lives in New Jersey with his wife and their two sons.\n\nCONTENTS\nPREFACE\nPART 1: YOUR LIFE AS PLANET EARTH\nAbbreviations\n1. TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD\n2.
