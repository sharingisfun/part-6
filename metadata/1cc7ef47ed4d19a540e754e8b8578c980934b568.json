It was released in 2013 and produced by Charlie Bauerfeind.\nContents\n\n    1 Overview\n    2 Track listing\n        2.1 Regular Album\n        2.2 Limited Edition Bonus Tracks\n        2.3 Japanese Edition Bonus Tracks\n    3 Line-up\n    4 Credits\n    5 Charts\n    6 References\n\nOverview\n\nRegarding the songs, guitarist and founding member Michael Weikath stated:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tStraight Out of Hell is the consequent development of the two albums before. The new songs are a continuation of the 7 Sinners directives, only less doom-bound and noticeably more positive. These songs will kick even the laziest listener's ass. \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAndi Deris confirmed that Straight Out of Hell was intentionally made to be a &quot;happy&quot; Helloween album. This was, according to Deris, partly in response to the band's darker material during the previous 10 years, and partly out of the band's interest in releasing a positive album in light of the failure of the 2012 Doomsday Prediction.\n\nWar and peace are the themes of the first two songs. Opening track, &quot;Nabatea&quot;, refers to the ancient Nabatean Kingdom, which exists in modern Jordan. Andi Deris explained that Nabatea is &quot;a nation which...was probably the only country which never brought war to other countries&quot;. A music video was shot for an edited version of &quot;Nabataea&quot;. By contrast, the acceptance of conflict by the modern world consumes the second track, &quot;World of War&quot;, which explores how contemporary humanity takes war as inevitable and seemingly cares little about the casualties, according to Deris.\n\nFaith is addressed in &quot;Far From the Stars&quot;, with bassist Markus Grosskopf explaining that the strength of one's belief, whether associated with a religion or not, is essential for survival. A different tack is taken on the last track, &quot;Church Breaks Down&quot;, which highlights the Church's actions throughout the centuries such as its refusal to adapt to scientific developments such as the theory of evolution).\n\nSeveral songs deal with the follies and occasionally strange beliefs of humanity. &quot;Burning Sun&quot; is more light-hearted, introducing a protagonist who, according to Weikath, dreams of steering a spaceship into the Sun. A version of the track featuring a Hammond organ (performed by Helloween session keyboardist Matthias Ulmer) was dedicated to the late Deep Purple organist Jon Lord and is included as a bonus track on the limited and Japanese editions of the album. On the other hand, &quot;Waiting for the Thunder&quot; is a piano-driven song about an unrepentant man, after doing wrong, simply awaits the punishment rather than trying to make amends. Deris conceded that, &quot;I know sometimes I'm that guy&quot;.\n\nIn addition to the dedication of the Hammond organ version of &quot;Burning Sun&quot; to Jon Lord, Helloween dedicated &quot;Wanna Be God&quot; to the late Freddie Mercury of Queen due to its affinity to the Queen's stadium rock track, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. Previously on December 12, 2012, Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, compared the drums of this track with a traditional Brazilian folk rhythm and also he wrote &quot;It seems they wanted to wear QUEENÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs shoes, as this track sounds like Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Will Rock YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by QUEEN to me&quot;\n\nThe title track toys with heavy metal clichÃƒÂ©s[18] while &quot;Years&quot; fixates upon life and death, and &quot;Make Fire Catch the Fly&quot; discusses the fear of rejection that may cause a person to never profess love for another.\nTrack listing\nRegular Album\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Nabataea&quot;   \tDeris \t7:03\n2. \t&quot;World of War&quot;   \tGerstner \t4:58\n3. \t&quot;Live Now!&quot;   \tDeris/Gerstner \t3:12\n4. \t&quot;Far From the Stars&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t4:43\n5. \t&quot;Burning Sun&quot;   \tWeikath \t5:35\n6. \t&quot;Waiting for the Thunder&quot;   \tDeris \t3:55\n7. \t&quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;   \tGerstner \t5:12\n8. \t&quot;Wanna Be God&quot; (dedicated to Freddie Mercury) \tDeris \t2:04\n9. \t&quot;Straight Out of Hell&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t4:35\n10. \t&quot;Asshole&quot;   \tGerstner \t4:12\n11. \t&quot;Years&quot;   \tWeikath \t4:24\n12. \t&quot;Make Fire Catch the Fly&quot;   \tDeris \t4:24\n13. \t&quot;Church Breaks Down&quot;   \tGerstner \t6:08\nLimited Edition Bonus Tracks\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n14. \t&quot;Another Shot of Life&quot; (limited edition bonus track) \tGrosskopf \t5:13\n15. \t&quot;Burning Sun (Hammond version)&quot; (limited edition bonus track; dedicated to Jon Lord) \tWeikath \t5:34\nJapanese Edition Bonus Tracks\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n14. \t&quot;No Eternity&quot; (Japanese bonus track) \tGrosskopf \t3:34\n15. \t&quot;Burning Sun (Hammond version)&quot; (Japanese bonus track; dedicated to Jon Lord) \tWeikath \t5:34\nLine-up\n\n    Andi Deris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Michael Weikath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals\n    Sascha Gerstner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals\n    Markus Grosskopf Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    Daniel LÃƒÂ¶ble Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nGuest musicians\n\n    Matthias Ulmer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cc7ef47ed4d19a540e754e8b8578c980934b568","amp;dn":"Helloween+-+Straight+Out+Of+Hell%28Limited+Edition%29+mp3++320k++ak6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cc7ef47ed4d19a540e754e8b8578c980934b568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,199,239,71,237,77,25,165,64,231,84,232,184,87,140,152,9,52,181,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
