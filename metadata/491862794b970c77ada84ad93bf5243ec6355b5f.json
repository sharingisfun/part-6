As a teacher and researcher at a premier engineering school, author Tony Hayter is in touch with engineers daily--and understands their vocabulary. The result of this familiarity with the professional community is a clear and readable writing style that readers understand and appreciate, as well as high-interest, relevant examples and data sets that hold readers' attention. A flexible approach to the use of computer tools includes tips for using various software packages as well as computer output (using MINITAB and other programs) that offers practice in interpreting output. Extensive use of examples and data sets illustrates the importance of statistical data collection and analysis for students in a variety of engineering areas as well as for students in physics, chemistry, computing, biology, management, and mathematics.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface x\nContinuing Case Studies: Microelectronic Solder Joints and Internet Marketing xv\nCHAPTER 1 - PROBABILITY THEORY 1\nCHAPTER 2 - RANDOM VARIABLES 71\nCHAPTER 3 - DISCRETE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS 147\nCHAPTER 4 - CONTINUOU S PROB A B ILITY D I S TRIB U TION S 186\nCHAPTER 5 - THE NORMAL D I S TRIB U TION 216\nCHAPTER 6 - D ES CRIPTIV E S TA TIS TICS 267\nCHAPTER 7 - S TA TIS TICA L ES TIMA TION A N D SAMPLING D I S TRIB U TION S 296\nCHAPTER 8 - IN FEREN CES ON A POPU LA TION MEA N 333\nCHAPTER 9 - COMPARING TWO POPU LA TION MEA N S 389\nCHAPTER 10 - D I S CRETE DATA ANALY S IS 432\nCHAPTER 11 - THE ANALY S IS OF VARIANCE 494\nCHAPTER 12 - S IMPLE LIN EA R REGRES S ION AND CORRELA TION 543\nCHAPTER 13 - MU LTIPLE LIN EA R REGRES S ION AND NONLIN EA R REGRES S ION 608\nCHAPTER 14 - MULTIFACTOR EX PERIMEN TA L D ES IGN A N D ANALY S IS 650\nCHAPTER 15 - NONPA RA METRIC S TA TIS TICA L ANALY S IS 694\nCHAPTER 16 - QUALITY CONTROL METHOD S 736\nCHAPTER 17 - RELIABILITY ANALYSIS AND LIFE TESTING 766\nTables 787\nAnswers to Odd-Numbered Problems 796\nIndex 818","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491862794b970c77ada84ad93bf5243ec6355b5f","amp;dn":"Probability+and+Statistics+for+Engineers+and+Scientists+%284th+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491862794b970c77ada84ad93bf5243ec6355b5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,24,98,121,75,151,12,119,173,168,74,217,59,245,36,62,198,53,91,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
