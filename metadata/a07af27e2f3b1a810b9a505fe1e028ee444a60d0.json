Ray Liotta plays Ford Cole, a big-city district attorney with his eye on the mayor's office and a big problem on his hands. One of his deputies, the beautiful assistant district attorney, Nora Timmer (Jolene Blalock), has just confessed to killing a man in what she claims was self-defense. A bad situation gets worse when an enigmatic stranger named Luther Pinks (James Todd Smith aka LL Cool J) turns up at the police station to contradict Nora's story and paint a very different picture of Ford's talented colleague. With his career and perhaps his life on the line, Ford has a mere handful of hours to sort the truth from the lies in a saga involving Nora, a record store clerk (Mekhi Phifer), and a powerful gang lord. \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJolene Blalock was the vulcan science officer in star trek enterprise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07af27e2f3b1a810b9a505fe1e028ee444a60d0","amp;dn":"Slow+Burn+DVDRip+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07af27e2f3b1a810b9a505fe1e028ee444a60d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,122,242,126,47,59,26,129,11,154,80,95,225,224,40,238,68,74,96,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
