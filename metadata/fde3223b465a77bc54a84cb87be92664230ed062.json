Selected and Introduced by Murray Stein.\n\nISBN: 9781400843091 | 280 pages | EPUB\n\n\nCARL GUSTAV JUNG (1875-1961), son of a Swiss Reformed pastor, used his Christian background throughout his career to illuminate the psychological roots of all religions.  Jung believed religion was a profound, psychological response to the unknown -- both the inner self and the outer worlds -- and he understood Christianity to be a profound meditation on the meaning of the life of Jesus of Nazareth within the context of Hebrew spirituality and the Biblical worldview.\n\nThis volume includes extensive selections from &quot;Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity,&quot; &quot;Christ as a Symbol of the Self,&quot; from Aion, &quot;Answer to Job,&quot; letters to Father Vincent White from Letters, and many more.\n\nMurray Stein's introduction relates Jung's personal relationship with Christianity to his psychological views on religion in general, his hermeneutic of religious thought, and his therapeutic attitude toward Christianity.  \n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Stein provides a good selection of Jung's texts with a clear introduction to his Christian background and theory of Christianity.&quot; -- Diane Jonte-Pace\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde3223b465a77bc54a84cb87be92664230ed062","amp;dn":"Carl+Gustav+Jung+-+On+Christianity+%28Murray+Stein%2C+ed.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde3223b465a77bc54a84cb87be92664230ed062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,227,34,59,70,90,119,188,84,168,76,184,123,233,38,100,35,14,208,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
