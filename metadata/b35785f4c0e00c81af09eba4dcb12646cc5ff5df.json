Having defeated the Chaos invasion of Middenheim, the Empire knows a measure of peace. But in the vast deserts of Nehekhara, another empire is rising. Nagash, the most feared of necromancers, is determined to claim dominance over the Old World, crushing all before him with an unstoppable and nightmarish army. Legions of unnatural creatures swarm the Empire. Sigmar must defend the lands of the living from the hordes of the dead and prevent Nagash's terrible vision of power coming true.\n\nWritten by Graham McNeill, Read by Martyn Ellis\nunabridged,  13Hours\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35785f4c0e00c81af09eba4dcb12646cc5ff5df","amp;dn":"Warhammer+-+Time+of+Legends+-+God+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35785f4c0e00c81af09eba4dcb12646cc5ff5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,87,133,244,192,224,12,129,175,9,235,164,220,177,38,70,204,95,245,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
