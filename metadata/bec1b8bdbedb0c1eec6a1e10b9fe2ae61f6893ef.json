She is desperately searching for a man named Matsunaga (Ryohei Suzuki), whom she met briefly in Tokyo a month earlier, but when they finally reconnect, he claims not to remember her and, after warning her to Ã¢â‚¬Å“never trust people in a foreign country,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ makes an unannounced exit. Akiko soon sees what he means when she is hustled off the street by strange men and ends up in a wasteland in a burlap bag, stripped of all her possessions but a handful of coins. Undeterred in her mission to locate Matsunaga, she finds shelter and a waitressing job at a Japanese restaurant run by a scuffling expat named Saito (Hiroshi Yamamoto) and his leggy Chinese lover (Aissy), who speaks fluent Japanese and is sympathetic to her plight. Then one day Akiko spots a familiar car and runs in pursuit, together with a flustered Saito as her guide. Is Matsunaga inside? \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Seventh Code.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 140 Kbps\nLength            : 924 MiB for 1h 0mn 19s 866ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 650 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 480 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3265404/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3265404/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese, Russian, English\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec1b8bdbedb0c1eec6a1e10b9fe2ae61f6893ef","amp;dn":"Seventh+Code+%28Kiyoshi+Kurosawa%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec1b8bdbedb0c1eec6a1e10b9fe2ae61f6893ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,193,184,189,190,219,12,30,236,106,30,16,185,254,42,230,31,104,147,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
