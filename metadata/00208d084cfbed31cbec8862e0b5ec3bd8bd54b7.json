The books chronicle the adventures of the skeleton detective, Skulduggery Pleasant and a teenage girl, Stephanie Edgley (Valkyrie Cain) along with other friends. The central story arc concerns Valkyrie's struggle to stop evil forces threatening the world, finally find justice for her late uncle's death, and her internal struggle of keeping the darkness within her to stay within.\nSince the release of the first novel, Skulduggery Pleasant, in 2007, the books have achieved immense popularity among teenagers and young adults. The series has been praised by both readers and critics.\n\nWritten by: Derek Landy\nRead by: Rupert Degas (1-4th books), Brian Bowles (5th book), Stephen Hogan (6-7th books)\nGenre: action, comedy, teen horror, young adult fantasy, juvenile fiction, ages 9+\nBitrate: 32-96 kbps\n\nTorrent contains audiobooks:\n01 - Skulduggery Pleasant: Scepter of the Ancients (released: April 16, 2007, listening length: 7h 19min)\n02 - Playing with Fire (released year: May 6, 2008, listening length: 6h 57min)\n03 - The Faceless Ones (released: 2 April 2009, listening length: 7h 46min)\n04 - Dark Days (released: 1 April 2010, listening length: 8h 10min)\n05 - Mortal Coil (released: September 30, 2010, listening length: 12h 23min)\n06 - Death Bringer (released: 1 Sep 2011, listening length: 13h 51min)\n07 - Kingdom of the Wicked (released: August 30, 2012, listening length: 15h 25min)\nThere are planned to be nine books.\nNearly all the books are NOT cut into chapters, I recommend to use free program &quot;Audio Cutter&quot; to cut them into 10 min parts (for example).\n\nTorrent also contains 1-6 books in .pdf format (not very good quality, mostly converted from ebook formats)\n\nPlease seed!
