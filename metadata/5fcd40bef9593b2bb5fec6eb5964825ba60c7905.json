Russia and the west were lovey-dovey until a humble cipher clerk at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa defected and spilled the beans. Igor Gouzenko was his name, and his revelations set off a firestorm. Nobody wanted to believe him at first - they were weary from fighting Hitler, a new round of conflict was too much to handle.\n\nEven if the politics seem dreary, this is a first-rate thriller, very much on the level of Hitchcock - it will keep you on the edge of your seats. There were so many bad red-scare movies, we forget there were also some excellent ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fcd40bef9593b2bb5fec6eb5964825ba60c7905","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Curtain+%281948%29+Gene+Tierney+Dana+Andrews+Gouzenko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fcd40bef9593b2bb5fec6eb5964825ba60c7905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,205,64,190,249,89,59,43,181,254,198,235,89,100,130,91,166,12,121,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
