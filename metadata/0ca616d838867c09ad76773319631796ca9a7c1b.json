Trained in the fighting arts and the laws of Tristia, the Greatcoats are travelling Magisters upholding KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law. They are heroes. Or at least they were, until they stood aside while the Dukes took the kingdom, and impaled their KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head on a spike.\n\nNow Tristia is on the verge of collapse and the barbarians are sniffing at the borders.
