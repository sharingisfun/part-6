From the cleaners and security staff, to air traffic control and the CEO, this series examines the human side of life at one of the world's most famous airports.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nHeavy fog throws Heathrow into turmoil and new terminal manager Callum is faced with hundreds of angry and stranded passengers stuck overnight at the airport, while visibility has dropped to less than 100m on the airfield and safety officer Chris is forced to marshal planes. Manager Nilam reveals the secrets of one of Heathrow's most exclusive first-class lounges and dispatcher James and his team hunt around the terminal for late passengers for a flight to Pakistan.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nAn American airline has one of its busiest days as hundreds of people fly to the USA for Thanksgiving, while Heathrow employee Sunita helps a woman who has lost her two-year old daughter. Ground staff use measures to disperse birds from the runway to prevent any collisions with aircraft, resident paramedic Izzy treats a pregnant passenger suffering from serious abdominal pain who is due to fly to Brazil that day and British Airways employees prepare for the inaugural flight of their new Ã‚Â£185 million aircraft the Dreamliner.\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nStorm Imogen causes chaos on the runways and in the terminals, with airside safety officer Simon keeping his eyes peeled for any potentially dangerous debris that could damage the landing planes. In Terminal 4, manager Sunita looks after dozens of passengers whose flight to Delhi has been cancelled, while trainee engineer Elliot prepares to get his hands dirty as he clears a blocked sewage pit - an essential part of the airport's operations that no passenger normally sees.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/52/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/52/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen11.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen12.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen13.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen14.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Britains-Busiest-Airport-Heathrow-Series-2-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2967 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 46mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 959 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/dm9dtd/heathrow-britains-busiest-airport","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d59f2591543cf736242c2408cf88cc7d25d4ca9","amp;dn":"ITV.Britains.Busiest.Airport.Heathrow.Series.2.1of3.720p.HDTV.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d59f2591543cf736242c2408cf88cc7d25d4ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,89,242,89,21,67,207,115,98,66,194,64,140,248,140,199,210,93,76,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
