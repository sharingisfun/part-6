It is the second of a series of live-action musical feature films, starring Jim Henson's Muppets. This film was produced by Henson Associates, ITC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, and premiered on 26 June 1981. The film was released shortly after the final season of The Muppet Show. It was shot entirely in England.\n\nIn the story, Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo the Great play newspaper reporters for the Daily Chronicle. Kermit and Fozzie, specifically, are playing identical twin reporters, which becomes the source of a running gag - supposedly, nobody can tell they are twins unless Fozzie wears his hat. The two are eventually assigned to investigate the theft of valuable jewels from fashion designer Lady Holliday (Diana Rigg), which they have to beg for after their boss fires them following the Daily Chronicle's headline about the two of them joining the staff (while the other papers report on the jewel heist).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34cb361ae36700330dbabdcf9073f2773e265c49","amp;dn":"The+Great+Muppet+Caper+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34cb361ae36700330dbabdcf9073f2773e265c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,203,54,26,227,103,0,51,13,186,189,207,144,115,242,119,62,38,92,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
