Dickenson\nProduct Description\nOver recent years, a number of significant developments in the application of valves have taken place: the increasing use of actuator devices, the introduction of more valve designs capable of reliable operation in difficult fluid handling situations; low noise technology and most importantly, the increasing attention being paid to product safety and reliability. Digital technology is making an impact on this market with manufacturers developing intelligent (smart) control valves incorporating control functions and interfaces.New metallic materials and coatings available make it possible to improve application ranges and reliability. New and improved polymers, plastic composite materials and ceramics are all playing their part.\nFibre-reinforced plastic pipe systems, glass-reinforced epoxy pipe systems and the traditional low-cost polyester pipe systems have all undergone sophisticated design and manufacturing technology changes. The potential for growth and expansion of the industry is huge.\nThe 3rd Edition of the Valves, Piping and Pipelines Handbook salutes these developments and provides the engineer with a timely first source of reference for the selection and application of Valves and Pipes.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 888 pages\nPublisher: Elsevier Science; 3 edition (November 5, 1999)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 185617252X\nISBN-13: 978-1856172523","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a6de270c41699215fecf4dd535fbdc33ff4b3f6","amp;dn":"Valves%2C+Piping+and+Pipelines+Handbook+3rd+Edition+by+T.C.+Dicken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a6de270c41699215fecf4dd535fbdc33ff4b3f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,109,226,112,196,22,153,33,95,236,244,221,83,95,189,195,63,244,179,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
