Dr.Acland is a professor of surgery in the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. The series was recently re-released on DVD as Acland's DVD Atlas of Human Anatomy\nThe six DVDs in this remarkable and beautifully produced DVD anatomy atlas explore the fundamental structures of the Musculoskeletal System, the Head and Neck, and the Internal Organs.\n\nVolume 1 - The Upper Extremity\nVolume 2 - The Lower Extremity\nVolume 3 - The Trunk (Musculoskeletal System)\nVolume 4 - The Head and Neck: Part 1\nVolume 5 - The Head and Neck: Part 2\nVolume 6 - The Internal Organs and Reproductive System\n\n\n\nThese DVDs show you true images of real, exquisitely dissected human anatomical specimens, in three dimensions. As the camera moves from one viewpoint to another, the specimen appears to rotate in space, letting the viewer experience it as a three-dimensional object. Acland's DVD Atlas uses fresh, un-embalmed specimens that retain the color, texture, mobilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and beautyÃ¢â‚¬â€of the living human body.\n\nA concise synchronized narration runs throughout the program. As each new structure is shown, its name appears on the screen. There is a self-testing feature at the end of each section. Specific content can be accessed through detailed searches of the index and table of contents.\n\nFor students, Acland's DVD Atlas is a time-saving aid to first-time learning, an effective way to relearn anatomy for clinical rotations, and a time-efficient tool for review. For clinicians in training and in practice, it assures a swift renewal of anatomic knowledge. For teachers, Acland's DVD Atlas shortens the time needed to provide immediate, satisfying explanations of three-dimensional structure.\n\n\nMore details\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://aclandanatomy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://aclandanatomy.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nI put Tapescript for All volumes and then begin to creat english subtitles using tapescript but my holiday is end..If someone could creat it please be kind enough to send me too\n\n**** This Acland 6 dvds set is complete and No missing parts...no jaming...Full screen 16:9....No black margins...size is small but Quality and resolution increased \n\nsource - original Acland 6 dvds pack\nGeneral\n\nFormat : Matroska (mkv)\nFile sizes- between 350mb -450mb\n\nVideo\nCodec ID :H.264 (x264)\nWidth : 720\nHeight : 404\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 Full screen \nFrame rate : source fps\n\nAudio\n\nCodec ID : AAC\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nchannels : 2 channels\n\n***** Note that this is not that incomplete skiping missing part collection in every where","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39fe95afbb88164e093ae33f8c2866d8a524e3c9","amp;dn":"Aclands+DVD+Atlas+of+Human+Anatomy+2.25GB+mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39fe95afbb88164e093ae33f8c2866d8a524e3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,254,149,175,187,136,22,78,9,58,227,63,140,40,102,216,165,36,227,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
