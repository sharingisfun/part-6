The bulk of their work is prevention and petty crime, such as pickpockets and purse-snatchers, but of course the more spectacular atypical cases, often one-offs, sometimes even involving the FBI, get extra attention. No less attention is paid to the relationships between all these hotshots (some change during the series), young and ambitious, sexy and horny, so there's lots of temptation, amorous and professional rivalry, conflicting personal and professional interests. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112112/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112112/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy the show, and thanks for choosing cOOt torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1beaaa785b4298398bbd8fe41996af7d70cd80a1","amp;dn":"Pacific+Blue+-+Season+1+%5BDVDRip%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1beaaa785b4298398bbd8fe41996af7d70cd80a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,234,170,120,91,66,152,57,139,189,143,228,25,150,175,125,112,205,128,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
