So it was logical to move this product to FSX. \n\nAs always we done so with care so all the new features of FSX are being used. We also combined both the Seahawks &amp; Boxer and the Coast Guard version and added 4 more highly detailed ships. To make it easy for you we also created a tool that allows you to use Google Earth (!) to place the ships in any location you like. \n\nThe helicopter is easy to fly (as the real one is), you will be in the air in minutes, but it will take many hours before you have mastered all the systems that are simulated in this helicopter. Created with assistance from several Seahawk pilots we are sure the advanced systems work as they are in the real helicopter.\n\nWith many thanks to B-52H","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52a0a5443276466a2ec6212a5a1dbf985c17e93","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Aerosoft+-+Seahawk+%26+Jayhawk+X+v2.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52a0a5443276466a2ec6212a5a1dbf985c17e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,42,10,84,67,39,100,102,162,236,98,18,165,161,219,249,133,193,126,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
