Its origin could be traced back to 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong came to power and vowed to transform China and the world. After the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcentury of humiliationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, China was in constant search of a new identity on the world stage. From alliance with the Soviet Union in the 1950s, China normalized relations with America in the 1970s and embraced the global economy and the international community since the 1980s. This book examines ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing relations with the two superpowers, Asian neighbours, Third World countries, and European powers.\nChina and the World since 1945 offers an overview of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement in the Korean War, the Sino-Soviet split, Sino-American rapprochement, the end of the Cold War, and globalization. It assess the roles of security, ideology, and domestic politics in Chinese foreign policy and provides a synthesis of the latest archival-based research on ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diplomatic history and Cold War international history.\nThis engaging new study examines the rise of China from a long-term historical perspective and will be essential to students of Chinese history and contemporary international relations.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n&quot;this volume offers a clear-cut and persuasive survey of China's post-1949 path toward achieving regional and international recognition. A useful reader for general audiences in the West and for undergraduates everywhere. Highly recommended.&quot; - CHOICE, G.
