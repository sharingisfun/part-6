Minutemen-DarthScanner)\n\nPromotional info - &quot;Written by Greg Rucka, Geoff Johns and Judd Winick Art by Jesus Saiz, Rags Morales, Ed Benes, Phil Jimenez, Ivan Reis, and various Cover by Ladronn Spinning out of IDENTITY CRISIS, COUNTDOWN TO INFINITE CRISIS was a Special that laid the groundwork for events in the DCU for the year to come. Now COUNTDOWN is collected with the hot miniseries that directly spun out of it: THE OMAC PROJECT! This crackerjack thriller by Greg Rucka (ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN, WONDER WOMAN) features the moody, gorgeous art of Jesus Saiz (MANHUNTER). Every hero and villain in the DCU is under the gaze of an unbelievably powerful spy satellite. It's a technological marvel that answers to only one person - and he's got plans for it that are completely unknown to the superspy organization he controls: Checkmate! In a world where men can fly and melt metal with their eyes, there's now an army created specifically as an answer to them: the OMACs Batman and old ally Booster Gold are about to learn the chilling truth behind the OMAC Project - but will they work with or against each other? &quot;\n\nYou can find Infinite Crisis here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10109353/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10109353/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is all six issues of the limited series plus the one-shot special, all scans by Minutemen-DarthScanner.
