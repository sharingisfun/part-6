It is filmed to simplify overdubbing in different languages. For example, the show avoids showing a narrator or host onscreen, does not often have employees of featured companies speak on camera, and keeps human interaction with the manufacturing process to a bare minimum. An off-screen narrator explains each process, almost always making use of puns. Each half hour show usually has three or four main segments, with each product getting a demonstration of about five minutes, with exceptions for more complex products. Usually every show has at least one product with an historic background note preceding it, showing how and where the product originated, and what people used before it. The historic note is shown through different cartoon animations actually being &quot;drawn&quot; on-screen by a computer program.\n\nAdditionally, in June 2008, the Science channel began airing How It's Made: Remix, consisting of previous segments arranged into theme episodes (&quot;Food&quot;, &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, etc.).\n\nTechnical Info:\n\nHow Its Made 101 Aluminum Foil - Snowboards - Contact Lenses - Bread.avi\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 233 MiB\nDuration : 22mn 26s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 451 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC : 3 warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 22mn 26s\nBit rate : 1 313 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.143\nStream size : 211 MiB (90%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.1.0 Beta2 (UTC 2005-04-04)\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 22mn 26s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 19.9 MiB (9%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 536 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.90.\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.6 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f556426ea227f8bde262399f791a316dbe12746b","amp;dn":"How+It%27s+Made+Season+1+to+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f556426ea227f8bde262399f791a316dbe12746b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,86,66,110,162,39,248,189,226,98,57,159,121,26,49,109,190,18,116,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
