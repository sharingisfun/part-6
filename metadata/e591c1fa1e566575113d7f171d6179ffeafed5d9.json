(born Eric Barrier, November 8, 1963)[2] and MC Rakim (born William Michael Griffin Jr., January 28, 1967).\n\nHailing from Long Island, New York, the duo were referred to by the journalist Tom Terrell of NPR as &quot;the most influential DJ/MC combo in contemporary pop music period,&quot;[3] while the editors of About.com ranked them as No. 3 on their list of the 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time.[4] They were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, although they did not make the final selection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Eric B &amp; Rakim :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e591c1fa1e566575113d7f171d6179ffeafed5d9","amp;dn":"Eric+B+and+Rakim+-+Discography+1987+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e591c1fa1e566575113d7f171d6179ffeafed5d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,145,193,250,30,86,101,117,17,61,127,23,29,97,121,255,234,254,213,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
