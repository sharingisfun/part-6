Joao's employees are mostly teenage girls, and he rigorously drills them in proper procedures and encourages a careful regimen of personal hygiene. But the single and rather lonely Joao has an unusual hobby -- he collects women's pubic hair, saving favorite samples in a scrapbook and claiming to have a few stray hairs from Queen Victoria. Eventually, Joao becomes romantically involved with one of the girls working at his shop, but when that relationship goes south, he finds himself attempting to seduce the 14-year-old daughter of the local butcher, which lands him deep in hot water. A Comedia de Deus was successful enough to inspire a 1999 sequel, As Bodas de Deus. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : A Comedia de Deus.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.95 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 42mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 718 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 42mn\n      Bit rate : 1 484 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.625\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.248\n      Stream size : 1.68 GiB (86%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 42mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 260 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0112710\n\nPortuguese audio; English and Portuguese srt subtitles, English, French, spanish ans Portuguese subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab8d09cab125bbc21121242c2fb2b020ddc0045","amp;dn":"Joao+Cesar+Monteiro+-+A+Comedia+de+Deus+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab8d09cab125bbc21121242c2fb2b020ddc0045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,184,208,156,171,18,91,188,33,18,18,66,194,251,43,2,13,220,0,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
