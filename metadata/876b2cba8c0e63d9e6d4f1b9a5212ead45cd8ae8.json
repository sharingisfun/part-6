It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It&amp;#039;s not like today&amp;#039;s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. &quot;Good bye, Maria. I&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ll make a fine nun.&quot; You want to smack her. Thirdly, it&amp;#039;s got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it&amp;#039;s great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it&amp;#039;s got great music. Fifthy, it&amp;#039;s got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song. It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie. For me, no other movie can compare. Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :) \n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876b2cba8c0e63d9e6d4f1b9a5212ead45cd8ae8","amp;dn":"The+Sound+of+Music%5B1965%5DDvDrip%5B720x436%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876b2cba8c0e63d9e6d4f1b9a5212ead45cd8ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,107,44,186,140,14,99,217,230,212,241,185,165,33,46,173,69,205,138,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
