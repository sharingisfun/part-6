He interviews scientists and campaigners from both sides of the climate change debate, and travels to New York to meet Tony, who has HIV but doesn't believe that that the virus is responsible for AIDS. This is a passionate defence of the importance of scientific evidence and the power of experiment, and a look at what scientists themselves need to do to earn trust in controversial areas of science in the 21st century.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.74 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S (BBCHD)\n\nXvid also available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2980a5c22ec8b48c7044e7827fb15ae6add986","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2011+Science+Under+Attack+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2980a5c22ec8b48c7044e7827fb15ae6add986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,41,128,165,194,46,200,180,140,112,68,231,130,127,177,90,230,173,217,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
