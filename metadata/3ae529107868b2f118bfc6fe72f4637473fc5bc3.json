But behind their idiotic facade, this monstrous pair possess a joint intelligence capable of outstripping the most advanced computers...\r\n\r\nManhattan has become the Island of Death. The former President of the United States stands barefoot in a purple toga around a cooking fire in the lobby of the Empire State Building. He is Dr Wilbur Daffodil-II Swain and Slapstick is his story - one of monstrous twins, orgies, revenge, golf, utopian schemes, and very little tooth brushing. In this post-apocalyptic black comedy - dedicated to Laurel and Hardy - Vonnegut is at his most hilarious, grotesque, and personal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Adam Grupper\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 96 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae529107868b2f118bfc6fe72f4637473fc5bc3","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+Slapstick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae529107868b2f118bfc6fe72f4637473fc5bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,229,41,16,120,104,178,241,24,191,198,254,114,244,99,116,115,252,91,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
