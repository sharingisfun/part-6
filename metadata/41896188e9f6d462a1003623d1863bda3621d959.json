In round one, Geoffrey Zakarian's secret love of potato crisps emerges in the form of dance, and Maneet Chauhan and Alex Guarnaschelli's boozy dishes only loosen him up further. In a truly bizarre round two, pork bung inspires Aaron Sanchez's new line of breathing apparatuses and plenty of generous seasoning. Marc Murphy does his best to sabotage others in the last round, but Maneet is determined to make the best dessert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Aug-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41896188e9f6d462a1003623d1863bda3621d959","amp;dn":"Chopped.After.Hours.S02E06.Chocolate.Bizarre.Foods.and.Sweetness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41896188e9f6d462a1003623d1863bda3621d959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,137,97,136,233,246,212,98,161,0,54,35,209,134,59,218,54,33,217,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
