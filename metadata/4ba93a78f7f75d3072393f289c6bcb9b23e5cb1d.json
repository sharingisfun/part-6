That history is far too interestingÃ¢â‚¬â€and far too important to our futureÃ¢â‚¬â€to be dismissed with a few stock explanations.\n\nEach lecture in A History of the U.S. Economy in the 20th Century focuses exclusively on one decade to achieve a clear understanding of economic developments and outside influences on the U.S. economy. In some cases, well-defined events like the creation of the Federal Reserve or war in Vietnam are examined. In other lectures, larger societal shifts are discussed, such as the evolving role of women in the economy and changing consumption patterns. \n\nThe miraculous story of the 20th-century U.S. economy unfolds with remarkable clarity and with valuable guidance for the 21st century.\n\n\n\nLecture 1:  The Curtain Opens on the 20th Century \n\nLecture 2:  Big Government is ConceivedÃ¢â‚¬â€Income Tax, the Federal Reserve, World War I  \n\nLecture 3:  The Roaring 1920s\n\nLecture 4:  The Depression Decade of the 1930s \n\nLecture 5:  The 1940sÃ¢â‚¬â€World War II and its aftermath\n\nLecture 6:  The Quiet Boom of the 1950s \n\nLecture 7:  The 1960s and the End of Certainty  \n\nLecture 8:  Stagflation and the 1970s \n\nLecture 9:  A Decade of DebtÃ¢â‚¬â€The 1980s\n\nLecture 10:  Inequality and Insecurity in the 1990s\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba93a78f7f75d3072393f289c6bcb9b23e5cb1d","amp;dn":"TTC+-+A+History+of+the+U.S.+Economy+in+the+20th+Century+%28Audio%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba93a78f7f75d3072393f289c6bcb9b23e5cb1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,58,120,247,247,93,48,114,57,63,40,156,107,203,155,35,229,203,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
