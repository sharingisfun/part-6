David Eick also serves as executive producer alongside Laeta Kalogridis and Jason Smilovic. Production of the series was halted due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America, and following its failure to be included in the Fall 2008 schedule it was announced that the series was canceled as the result of low ratings.\n\nThe series revolved around bartender Jaime Sommers, who is saved from death after receiving experimental medical implants. While adjusting to her new bionic powers and raising a rebellious younger sister, Jaime agrees to work for the Berkut Group, a quasi-governmental private organization that performed her surgery.\n\nStarring Michelle Ryan, Katee Sackhoff, Lucy Hale.
