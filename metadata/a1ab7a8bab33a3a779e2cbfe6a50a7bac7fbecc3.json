Like any odds'n'sods collection, this is uneven, but that's its charm since it captures Nirvana's character better than any official album. After all, this was a band that was born equally from '70s sludge metal, bubblegum pop, post-punk artiness, and indie rock inclusiveness, each of which are apparent on this collection. There are some non-entities here, particularly on the second side, but the plodding sub-metallic grind was part of their identity, one part of their multi-faceted character. Nirvana meant everything to everyone, from the jangle pop veterans to the garage rock ravers that worshipped the Stooges to stoner metal fetishes and indie rock bed-sits that adopted Sebadoh just as they outgrew Morrissey -- everybody loved Nirvana, and there's something for every kind fan here, thanks to murky sludge, Devo and Vaseline covers, BBC sessions, instrumentals, and limited-edition singles, plus sub-Melvins goop, everything visceral where Bleach was tame. Nevermind doesn't capture this freewheeling indie spirit but Incesticide does, piling on some essentials in the meantime -- the pummeling &quot;Dive,&quot; the childhood snapshot &quot;Sliver,&quot; the terrific forgotten indie pop tune &quot;Been a Son,&quot; and &quot;Aneurysm,&quot; perhaps the greatest single song the group ever recorded. Yeah, there's some filler here, but this is the sound of what Nirvana was actually like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ab7a8bab33a3a779e2cbfe6a50a7bac7fbecc3","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Incesticide+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ab7a8bab33a3a779e2cbfe6a50a7bac7fbecc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,171,122,139,171,51,163,167,121,226,203,254,106,80,167,186,199,251,236,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
