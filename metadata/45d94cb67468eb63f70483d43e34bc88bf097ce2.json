It is the first with drummer Ed Blackwell replacing his \npredecessor Billy Higgins in the Coleman Quartet, and is the only Atlantic album by Coleman to include a \nstandard, in this case a version of &quot;Embraceable You&quot; by George and Ira Gershwin. Two recording sessions for\n the album took place in July and one in August of 1960 at Atlantic Studios in New York City. The seven \nselections for this album were culled from 23 masters recorded over the three sessions.\n\n==============================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 Blues Connotation.flac\nA2 Beauty Is A Rare Thing.flac\nA3 Kaleidoscope.flac\nB1 Embraceable You.flac\nB2 Poise.flac\nB3 Humpty Dumpty.flac\nB4 Folk Tale.flac\n\n==========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 768 MiB\nAlbum                                    : This Is Our Music\nTrack name/Total                         : 7\nPerformer                                : Ornette Coleman Quartet\nComposer                                 : Ornette Coleman\nProducer                                 : Atlantic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SD-1353 (US Reissue Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s).
