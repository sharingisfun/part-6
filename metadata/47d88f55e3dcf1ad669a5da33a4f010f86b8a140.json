The great thing about that is, the original album that brought the Allmans so much acclaim is as notable for its clever studio editing as it is for its performances. It showcases the group&amp;#039;s terrific instrumental interplay, letting each member (but particularly guitarist Duane and keyboardist/vocalist Gregg) shine. Even after the release of the unedited concerts, it remains the pinnacle of the Allmans and Southern rock at its most elastic, bluesy, and jazzy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d88f55e3dcf1ad669a5da33a4f010f86b8a140","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+Live+at+Fillmore+East+-+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d88f55e3dcf1ad669a5da33a4f010f86b8a140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,216,143,85,227,220,241,173,102,154,93,163,58,79,1,15,134,184,161,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
