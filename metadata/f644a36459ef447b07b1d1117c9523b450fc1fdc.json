His artwork-with its simple, bold lines and dynamic figures in motion-filtered in to the world's consciousness and is still instantly recognizable, twenty years after his death. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition features ninety black-and-white images of classic artwork and never-before-published Polaroid images, and is a remarkable glimpse of a man who, in his quest to become an artist, instead became an icon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f644a36459ef447b07b1d1117c9523b450fc1fdc","amp;dn":"Keith+Haring+Journals+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f644a36459ef447b07b1d1117c9523b450fc1fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,68,163,100,89,239,68,123,7,177,209,17,124,149,35,180,80,252,31,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
