It stars Swedish actress Pernilla August and Melinda Kinnaman as Mary, David Threlfall as Joseph (his legal guardian, not father) and Christian Bale as Jesus. The film was produced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver and aired on NBC.\n\nThe film emphasizes Mary's importance in Jesus's life, suggesting that his parables were inspired by stories she told him in his childhood. This, and similar details about Jesus's upbringing, cannot be confirmed, but are certainly not impossible. The resurrected Jesus also appears to his mother privately. This event is not found in the Gospels, but is probably based on an ancient Catholic tradition (not official teaching) that he appeared to her first of all people. The tradition influenced Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises among others. The movie closes with Mary suggesting the disciples should start preaching about her son.\n\nGeneral\nFormat version : Version 2\nFile size : 1.75 GiB\nDuration : 1h 27mn\nOverall bit rate : 2 840 Kbps\nWriting application : libmatroska 1.3.0\nWriting library : SolveigMM Matroska Muxer Version 1.0.1208.20\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0840616f6048443c2638&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 11 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 27mn\nBit rate : 2 336 Kbps\n\nWidth : 716 pixels\nHeight : 574 pixels\n\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.227\nStream size : 1.44 GiB (82%)\nMatrix coefficients : BT.601\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 1h 27mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 282 MiB (16%)\nLanguage : English\n\n\n\n\nthanks to &quot;Wrnr &quot; at rutracker for source file\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a32cf01891de59dc91bed7f5ea7cd3c2857a0da","amp;dn":"1999+Mary%2C+Mother+of+Jesus+cgculpepper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a32cf01891de59dc91bed7f5ea7cd3c2857a0da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,50,207,1,137,29,229,157,201,27,237,127,94,167,205,60,40,87,160,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
