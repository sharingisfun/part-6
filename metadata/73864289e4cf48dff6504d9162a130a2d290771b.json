When she found someone who was, Ham walked out of her life. Three years later, Zara's lost her business, her marriage, and she's barely getting by in a tiny apartment on the wrong side of the tracks. As soon as Ham hears about Zara's plight, he's on her doorstep offering her a lifeline. Now, it will take every ounce of will power she possesses to resist all that he offers.\n\nHam was always a traveling man, never one to settle down in one town, with one woman, for more time than absolutely necessary. But Ham's faced his own demons, and he's learned a lot. About himself, and about the life he knows he's meant to live. So when he hears that Zara's having a rough time, he wants to be the one to help. In fact, he wants to do more than that for Zara. A lot more. But first, he must prove to Zara that he's a changed man.\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73864289e4cf48dff6504d9162a130a2d290771b","amp;dn":"Jagged+-+Kristen+Ashley.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73864289e4cf48dff6504d9162a130a2d290771b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,134,66,137,228,207,72,223,246,80,77,145,98,161,48,162,210,144,119,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
