P. Snow delivered his famous 1959 lecture, &quot;The Two Cultures.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn A Cultural History of Physics, Hungarian scientist and educator KÃ¡roly Simonyi succeeds in bridging this chasm by describing the experimental methods and theoretical interpretations that created scientific knowledge, from ancient times to the present day, within the cultural environment in which it was formed. Unlike any other work of its kind, Simonyiâ€™s seminal opus explores the interplay of science and the humanities to convey the wonder and excitement of scientific development throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nThese pages contain an abundance of excerpts from original resources, a wide array of clear and straightforward explanations, and an astonishing wealth of insight, revealing the historical progress of science and inviting readers into a dialogue with the great scientific minds that shaped our current understanding of physics.\r\n\r\nBeautifully illustrated, accurate in its scientific content and broad in its historical and cultural perspective, this book will be a valuable reference for scholars and an inspiration to aspiring scientists and humanists who believe that science is an integral part of our culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a343d5f859cbb0f2bffa183dd8e728466d5e5bc2","amp;dn":"A+Cultural+History+of+Physics+-+1st+Edition+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a343d5f859cbb0f2bffa183dd8e728466d5e5bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,67,213,248,89,203,176,242,191,250,24,61,216,231,40,70,109,94,91,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
