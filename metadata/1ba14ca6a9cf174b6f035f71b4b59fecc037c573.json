They are best known for their hit song &quot;Flirtin' with Disaster&quot; from the album of the same title. \n\nThe band, founded by Dave Hlubek and Steve Holland, took its name from a prostitute who allegedly mutilated and decapitated her clients. Most of Molly Hatchet album covers feature heroic fantasy inspired art, some of which were painted by artists Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo and Paul R. Gregory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Members:\n\n\nDave Hlubek: guitars, vocals (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987, 2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nJohn Galvin: keyboards (1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991, 1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nBobby Ingram: guitars (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nPhil McCormack: vocals (1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nTim Lindsey: bass (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nShawn Beamer: drums (2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011, 2013-present)\n\n\n\nFormer Members:\n\n\nDuane Roland: guitars (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990; died 2006)\n\nSteve Holland: guitars (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1984)\n\nBruce Crump: drums (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1982, 1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990)\n\nBanner Thomas: bass (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1981)\n\nDanny Joe Brown: vocals (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1980, 1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996; died 2005)\n\nMelvin Powell: keyboards (1978)\n\nJimmy Farrar: vocals (1980Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1982)\n\nRiff West: bass (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990)\n\nB.B.
