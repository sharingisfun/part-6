President Snow visits Katniss and explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince everyone her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol.\nAs the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy, mentor to Katniss and Peeta, warns them that the &quot;show&quot; of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and congratulated by Snow at his mansion in the Capitol.\nReturning home, Katniss warns her friend Gale Hawthorne of Snow's threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12 and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces a special Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, where all tributes will be selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta survives, recruiting Haymitch's help to do so. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katniss and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place.\nAs they prepare, Haymitch reveals that all the tributes are angry at being returned to the Games and advises a reluctant Katniss to make allies. In the pre-Games interviews, Katniss wears her wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay (as punishment, Cinna is later severely beaten by Peacekeepers before a helpless Katniss is sent into the arena). Peeta announces that they are expecting a baby which causes outrage and the audience of Capitol citizens to begin shouting for the Games to be stopped.\nIn the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, from District 4. The arena's outer forcefield shocks Peeta, stopping his heartbeat until Finnick revives him. The group flees a poisonous fog, and Mags sacrifices herself so as to avoid slowing them down. When vicious mandrills attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a tribute from District 6. The group escapes to a beach and meets District 3's Wiress and Beetee, and District 7's Johanna Mason. Wiress discovers the arena is designed like a clock with regular hazards each hour, but is killed soon after in a battle.\nBeetee suggests using one of the hazards, a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, and a coil of wire to electrocute the other remaining tributes. The group separates to prepare the trap, but once alone Johanna appears to attack Katniss Ã¢â‚¬â€ in reality cutting the tracker from Katniss' arm. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee with the wire from the tree attached to a makeshift spear. Unable to find Peeta, Katniss almost attacks Finnick, but Finnick reminds her to consider &quot;who the real enemy is&quot;, as Haymitch had advised her prior to the Games. Katniss attaches the remaining wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena forcefield as the lightning hits, causing a power failure that takes down the dome's forcefield as well as the Capitol's surveillance.\nKatniss awakens in an aircraft to find Haymitch, Beetee, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the new rebellion, and that half the tributes were aware of the plan to escape with Katniss, as a symbol for the growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, who were taken by the Capitol. A distraught Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch. She later awakens to find Gale by her side, who reassures that her family is safe but tells her that there is no District 12 anymore. It was bombed and destroyed by the capitol.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a380c73612dbdc624a9fe6bc9784b0db6e983b","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games+Catching.Fire.2013.IMAX.EDITION.1080p.BluRay.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a380c73612dbdc624a9fe6bc9784b0db6e983b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,163,128,199,54,18,219,220,98,74,159,230,188,151,132,176,219,110,152,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
