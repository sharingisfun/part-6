Thugs became celebrities, responsible authority was rendered impotent. Social mores in place for a century were obliterated. Especially among the young, and most especially among young women, liquor consumption rocketed, propelling the rest of the culture with it: skirts shortened. Music heated up. America's Sweetheart morphed into The Vamp.\n\nProhibition turned law-abiding citizens into criminals, made a mockery of the justice system, caused illicit drinking to seem glamorous and fun, encouraged neighborhood gangs to become national crime syndicates, permitted government officials to bend and sometimes even break the law, and fostered cynicism and hypocrisy that corroded the social contract all across the country. With Prohibition in place, but ineffectively enforced, one observer noted, America had hardly freed itself from the scourge of alcohol abuse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ instead, the &quot;drys&quot; had their law, while the &quot;wets&quot; had their liquor.\n\nThe story of Prohibition's rise and fall is a compelling saga that goes far beyond the oft-told tales of gangsters, rum runners, flappers, and speakeasies, to reveal a complicated and divided nation in the throes of momentous transformation. The film raises vital questions that are as relevant today as they were 100 years ago ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ about means and ends, individual rights and responsibilities, the proper role of government and finally, who is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and who is not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a real American.\n\nEpisode One - A Nation of Drunkards\nOriginally aired October 2, 2011\n\nAmericans have argued over alcohol for centuries. Since the early years of the American Republic, drinking has been at least as American as apple pie. As Episode 1: A Nation of Drunkards begins, clergymen, craftsmen and canal-diggers drink. So do the crowds of men who turn out for barn-raisings and baptisms, funerals, elections and public hangings. Tankards of cider are kept by farmhouses' front doors, and in many places alcohol is considered safer to drink than water. Alcohol, along with its attendant rituals and traditions, is embedded in the fabric of American culture.\n\n\nEpisode Two - A Nation of Scofflaws\nOriginally aired October 3, 2011\n\nOn January 16, 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution goes into effect, making it illegal to manufacture, transport or sell intoxicating liquor. Episode Two, A Nation of Scofflaws, examines the problems of enforcement, as millions of law-abiding Americans become lawbreakers overnight.\n\n\nEpisode Three - A Nation of Hyprocrites\nOriginally aired October 4, 2011\n\nIn the mid 1920s, an unprecedented winning streak continues on Wall Street, and it feels to many like the good times will go on forever. Americans during the Jazz Age, writes F. Scott Fitzgerald, are &quot;a whole race gone hedonistic, deciding on pleasure.&quot; Prohibition, with its moralistic underpinnings, begins to feel anachronistic at best. In Episode 3, A Nation of Hypocrites, support for the law diminishes as the playfulness of sneaking around for a drink gives way to disenchantment with its glaring unintended consequences.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264\nVideo Bitrate: ~2537 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\nAudio Bitrate: ~340 kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: ~1:45:00\nFramerate: 29.97 fps\nSize: ~2.2GB each\nSource: 1080i OTA ATSC\nEncoded by: joeyjoejoe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:540156e5e5096f0cfafd99989f0c9119c156a4a0","amp;dn":"PBS.Prohibition.1of3.A.Nation.of.Drunkards.2011.HDTV.x264.AAC.MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"540156e5e5096f0cfafd99989f0c9119c156a4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,1,86,229,229,9,111,12,250,253,153,152,159,12,145,25,193,86,164,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
