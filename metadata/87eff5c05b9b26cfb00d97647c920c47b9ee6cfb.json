Packed with features across all classical music genres, its globally acclaimed writers inform and entertain you with independent and intelligent editorial and more than 150 reviews in every issue. Gramophone's reputation is founded on its acclaimed critical analyses of the latest CD releases, in-depth features and interviews with classical stars, and its comprehensive coverage of recorded and live music.\n\n\nIN THE FEBRUARY ISSUE:\n\n* We celebrate the legacy and extraordinary musicianship of English cellist Jacqueline du PrÃƒÂ©, 50 years after she made her iconic Elgar Cello Concerto recording;\n\n* there's a fascinating focus on the life and music of Alexander Scriabin, one of Russia's most eccentric composers, in celebration of the centenary of his birth;\n\n* and a Collection on the Franck Violin Sonata and a Specialist's Guide on 20th-century Evensong settings.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: SuprBay, TPB's forum, has now been restored at a new address and I can be contacted there with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc. (you will need to register an account):\n                                                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
