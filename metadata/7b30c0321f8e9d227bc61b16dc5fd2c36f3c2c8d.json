An ambitious couple are about to open the island's most spectacular hotel, where Greek and Turkish Cypriots work in harmony. Two neighbouring families, the Georgious and the Ãƒâ€“zkans, are among many who moved to Famagusta to escape the years of unrest and ethnic violence elsewhere on the island. But beneath the city's faÃƒÂ§ade of glamour and success, tension is building. \n\nWhen a Greek coup plunges the island into chaos, Cyprus faces a disastrous conflict. Turkey invades to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, and Famagusta is shelled. Forty thousand people seize their most precious possessions and flee from the advancing soldiers. In the deserted city, just two families remain. This is their story. \nepub/mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b30c0321f8e9d227bc61b16dc5fd2c36f3c2c8d","amp;dn":"Victoria+Hislop+-+The+Sunrise+%28Sep+25+2014%29Epub%2C+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b30c0321f8e9d227bc61b16dc5fd2c36f3c2c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,48,192,50,31,142,157,34,123,198,27,22,220,95,210,195,111,60,44,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
