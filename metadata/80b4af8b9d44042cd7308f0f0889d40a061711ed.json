Holy smoke lol Big Papi could not be considered a real pirate if he did not rip some good ol' Slick Rick. He was history in the making....A Brit of all things.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n[quote]By Scott D. Gribble \nThis is the kind of album you HAVE to give props to. It is one of the most important albums in Hip-Hop's history, taking in account the lyrical advancements it made. Although the rhymes here are neither as complex as Rakim or Kool Keith's, nor were they as conscious as Chuck D or KRS-One (which all came out in '88), his style was on a different level. Before tracks rarely where held tight to one theme throughout their entire length and never had raps sounded like believable narratives. &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; pretty much set the standard and became the blueprint for story-telling raps for every generation that followed.\n\nLyrically, Rick's raps still hold up well even by today's standards (which ironically seem to have taken a step backwards). His smooth voice &amp; British accent draw the listener in as his flow takes you through a seamless ride. He has one of those voices that people instinctively like. There really is no rapper that can match Slick Rick's style and delivery. Only a young Snoop Dogg could be considered to be on that same level.\n\nI can say that many of these beats do not hold up well over time (and for the casual rap fan, that's probably more than enough to discourage them). The horns and bass on &quot;The Ruler's Back&quot; sound corny, the Casio keys for &quot;Teacher, Teacher&quot; &amp; &quot;Teenage Love&quot; are pretty lame and more often than not do the songs completely rely on Slick Rick to carry them. Fortunately, Rick's one of the best ever and does more than save these tracks - frequently he turns them into classics.\n\nObvious favorites are &quot;Children's Story&quot;, (which shouldn't need explaining since it's the probably the most sampled song both lyric and production wise) &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, (silly and downright stupid at times, yet undeniably fun and catchy) and of course &quot;Indian Girl&quot; (which is hilarious). &quot;Let's Get Crazy&quot; is a solid 80's party jam &amp; battle raps fly on &quot;Lick the Balls&quot;. Other highlights that Rick's storytelling really make worth it are &quot;The Moment I Feared&quot;, &quot;Kit&quot;, &amp; &quot;Treat Her Like a Prostitute&quot;. Without a fail, Rick always manages to engage the listener with his meticulous tales where the rhymes never sound forced, yet are always creative.\n\nIf this where released a bit later, the beats on this album would definitely detract from the quality of the album. But, during this time great beats where really not as prevalent as they were even two years later. &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; is a lyrical masterpiece (by any standards) and its influence can't be measured. For that alone it's considered a classic and should find its way to any rap aficionado's collection.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/qwj63Ux47V.png[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Slick Rick - The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (Def Jam 40513)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Slick Rick\nAlbum................: The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (Def Jam 40513)\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
