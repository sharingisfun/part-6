The original members of The Waifs are Josh Cunningham (guitar, vocals), and sisters Vikki Thorn (harmonica, guitar, vocals) and Donna Simpson (guitar, vocals). Their current tour band also includes Ben Franz (bass) and David Ross MacDonald (drums).\n\nTheir 2003 album Up All Night reached double platinum in Australia and reached the top five of the Australian album charts, and the band won four ARIA Awards in October 2003. The Waifs have enjoyed two top fifty singles in Australia, London Still in 2002 and Bridal Train in 2004. The band so impressed Bob Dylan when they supported him on his 2003 Australian tour that he asked them to join him in his 2003 North American tour, including a gig at the Newport Folk Festival\n\nThe Waifs co-own the independent label Jarrah Records with John Butler, and their records are released in Australia under that label.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e4ddc2d093af0e972a7e39a9dc5a6191a1019c","amp;dn":"The+Waifs+-+Temptation+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e4ddc2d093af0e972a7e39a9dc5a6191a1019c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,228,221,194,208,147,175,14,151,42,126,57,169,220,90,97,145,161,1,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
