This is a live show so the rip is done with gapless playback so each track plays seamlessly into the next track. Not a good idea to shuffle live shows, so please do not shuffle these songs. In some players you can set &quot;Do not shuffle.&quot; in the tags.\n\nMP3 tags have also been edited so Disc 1 and Disc 2 show up under 1 Album in player view.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\nBy Thomas Downey on May 17, 1999\n[quote]There are just some albums that everyone must own. &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; is one of them. This is one of the 3 best live recordings ever (The Who's &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; and &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot; being the others). Now it has become even greater, and all the more essential, in this new version including all the material off of &quot;Budokan II&quot; and re-arrainged in the original set-list from the concert. The sound quality has never been better (even rivaling the gold edition floating around); Columbia/Legacy have built a good reputation in their fine remasters. And this is no exception, especally with the added material. \n\nYou are THERE, in the crowd. Tom's bass sounds positivly chunky, Bun E.'s drums are crisp &amp; deep, Rick's guitar soars &amp; Robin is truly amazing. From the opening scorch of &quot;Hello There&quot; thru the all-out assult on &quot;Clock Strikes Ten&quot;, the crunch of &quot;Auf Vedershen&quot; &amp; &quot;Surrender&quot; and the pop jump of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, it's all here. The defining pop/rock sound that is often imitatded, never been duplicated. \n\nThis is the sound that all of the 90's wanna-be alt-rockers have been trying to emulate (Billy Corigan &amp; Kurt Cobain freely admitted it). If you're a serious rock fan, you need to own this. If you have the original, time to trade up. It all starts here. Truly timeless kickin' rock &amp; roll.[/quote]\n\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/381c43445cef16eccfcb588a4842d78c6fca90d6.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Cheap Trick - At Budokan: The Complete Concert\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Cheap Trick\nAlbum................: At Budokan: The Complete Concert\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1978\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 66 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Disc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
