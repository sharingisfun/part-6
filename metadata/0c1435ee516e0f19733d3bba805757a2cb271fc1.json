The eight months of my life when I was Nick OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢MalleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual submissive. \n\nEight months of the best sex IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever had. Eight months of spankings and nipple clamps, eight months of floggers and whips, eight months of swiftly escalating obedience and submission. \n\nAnd then, things started escalating in a way that I was powerless to resist. \n\nI recognized the look in PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes today because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen it before. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen the same look in NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes for eight months Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a certain focused intensity and a calm control, before he began to steadily strip apart every little bit of who I was, every little spark of personality, to create a sweet, willing submissive instead. \n\nWhen I finally summoned the courage to break my terrible addiction, I made a promise to myself. No more. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d play my spanking games, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d play at submission. But I could sense dominance in men, and I avoided it; I had determined that I was not strong enough to survive again. \n\nThe look in PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes took me back to that dark time. And I was adamant I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go there again. \n\n***Patrick and Lisa continue to see each other, but they are both keeping secrets; secrets that could tear them apart. How long before they find out what the other has been hiding?*** \n\nNote: This novella includes medical play, spankings, domination, graphic sexual scenes, and more. \n\n*** \n\nAn excerpt: \n\nI was a distracted, horny mess. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think about Patrick without thinking about the way he had spanked me; the way he had strapped me down to the examination table and thrust his cock down my throat; the way he had pulled me into his body as he handed me coffee Sunday morning. By the time Wednesday evening came around, I would have spontaneously combusted if he so much as looked at my clitoris. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Miss Preston,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Patrick greeted me at his door. I was dressed casually, since I was aware the clothes werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to stay on for very long; jeans and a t-shirt; a hoodie thrown over it. Even my lingerie underneath was plain; a simple grey cotton bra and panties. Functional clothes; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be taking them off shortly. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dr. Anderson,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I replied. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Go on to the examination room please, and change into the robe,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be along in a minute.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Yes, Doctor,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I said obediently, and made my way upstairs. My hands were shaking; my entire body was tingling in anticipation. Standing in the middle of the examination room, I forced myself to take several deep breaths before I stepped out of my clothing, and into the almost-transparent robe. \n\nHe had warned me when we talked on the phone Monday that today would be intense; he had insisted on a safeword. Red. I kept it simple. He wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell me anything else; laughing and refusing to ruin the surprise. I changed into my robe on autopilot while reliving the memory of our conversation Monday, and I realized I was smiling. Fuck. Three dates, a couple of phone calls, and I was seriously hooked. This was trouble. \n\nI sat down on the stool, the metal cold against my bare ass, and I waited for him. \n\nA knock, and he entered. He looked gorgeous; he was wearing his white lab coat, and under it, a blue shirt and grey slacks; I wanted to rip it all from his body; and take his hard length in me; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been fantasizing about Patrick since Sunday. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Safeword?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he asked, searching my eyes for any hint of unease. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Red,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I replied instantly. I should have been nervous at the need for a safeword; I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used one since Nick, twelve long years ago. But instead, I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to get started. There was an ease here; I felt safe with Patrick. He grinned and nodded. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Miss Preston,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, smiling at me, warmth both in his eyes and in his voice. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I see from my notes here that you are still having trouble achieving orgasm?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00HQ8WLM4\nPublished: January 6, 2014\nLanguage: English\n\n- - -\n\nBook #3 - Diagnosis\n\nMy name is Lisa Preston. \n\nLess than a month ago, I met a gorgeous guy in a bar and went home with him.
