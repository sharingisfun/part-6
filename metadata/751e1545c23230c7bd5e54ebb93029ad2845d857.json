As the Prince's vessel nears the shores of the city, he removes the medallion from his chestplate and drops it into the sea. Upon returning to Babylon, he is horrified to find that the city is currently being ravaged by war. His ship is attacked and he and Kaileena are thrown overboard, with Kaileena taken prisoner after drifting ashore. He then tries to rescue Kaileena , but ultimately, finds the Vizier still alive, and once he finds him, the Vizier kills Kaileena with the Dagger of Time, which contains The Sands of Time now, and after this, the Vizier impales himself with the Dagger, making him immortal. The Prince is also affected, having a whip-like weapon known as a Daggertail embedded in his skin, with the Sands infecting the wound.\t\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nCPU: Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon\nCPU Speed: 1 GHz\nRAM: 256 MB\nOS: Windows 2000/XP (only)\nVideo Card:32 MB DirectX 9.0c compliant video card (NVIDIA GeForce3+ / ATI Radeon 7500+)\nDirectX version: DirectX 9.0c (included on disk)\nSound Card: Yes\nFree Disk Space: 1.5 GB\nCD-ROM: 16x or faster or 4x DVD-ROM\n\nRecommended Requirements:\n\nCPU: Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon XP\nCPU Speed: 1.5 GHz\nRAM: 512 MB\nOS: Windows 2000/XP (only)\nVideo Card: 28 MB DirectX 9.0c compliant video card (NVIDIA GeForce3+ / ATI Radeon 7500+)\nDirectX version: DirectX 9.0c (included on disk)\nSound Card: Yes\nFree Disk Space: 1.5 GB\nCD-ROM: 32x or faster or 4x DVD-ROM\n\nSeed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751e1545c23230c7bd5e54ebb93029ad2845d857","amp;dn":"Prince+Of+Persia+-+The+Two+Thrones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751e1545c23230c7bd5e54ebb93029ad2845d857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,30,21,69,194,50,48,199,189,94,84,235,185,48,41,173,40,69,216,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
