Sling Shot to Heaven is the fifth full-length from the band, put to 2&quot; analog tape over a series of months in the group's home studio. As Edwards and the band neared a decade of touring, recording, and prolific output as a hard-working indie rock outfit, themes of adulthood and reflection fill the album, making it a more mature and patient statement than we've heard from the band previously. The sweetness of long-term partnership and love is touched on in &quot;When You're Gone,&quot; while &quot;Go to Sleep You Little Creep&quot; is a coy but touching dialogue between a rambunctious son avoiding bedtime and a weary father trying to wind down after a hard day of work. Edwards reflects on the restlessness of youth and his history of hard traveling, ruminating on these things as memories of a different time. Musically, the album follows the same stylistic trends of fourth album Rot Gut, Domestic, turning in bright production and thoughtful lighter-toned introspective indie rock modes ÃƒÂ  la Wilco or Ryan Adams. The home-recorded pace of the album comes through in the considered production choices of the songs, with each subtle turn sounding deliberate but not overthought. The result is a relaxed, conversational album with stronger songs than some of the band's earlier efforts, looking over concepts of aging gracefully without succumbing to the clichÃƒÂ©s that often come along with such trains of thought.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af034ac5a3e714888e3010135f4f59a015fa0a64","amp;dn":"Margot+%26+The+Nuclear+So+and+So%27s+-+Slingshot+to+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af034ac5a3e714888e3010135f4f59a015fa0a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,3,74,197,163,231,20,136,142,48,16,19,95,79,89,160,21,250,10,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
