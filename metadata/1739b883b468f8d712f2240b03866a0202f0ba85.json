The Cuban pianist first came to international attention when he achieved the seemingly impossible by successfully taking over from the late and brilliant Ruben Gonzalez in the Buena Vista Social Club, but he has gone on to prove that he is not just a dazzling accompanist but a bravely original composer and performer capable of a startling variety of styles.\n\nHis previous solo sets have shown him moving away from Buena Vista-style material to a more adventurous approach, mixing his Cuban roots with themes from around the world. The trend continues here: he mixes jazz with global influences, especially from Africa, and Yo is remarkable for its variety, its confidence, and its sheer energy. \n\nBy matching tradition with experiment, Fonseca has become one of the most exciting musicians in the new Cuban scene. The rush of rhythm and percussion and Fonseca's piano hits you like an assault. Every track is remarkable for the feel and the emotional intensity of the playing as well as the integrity of the performances. This is modern Cuban music at its absolute best. \nHighly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1739b883b468f8d712f2240b03866a0202f0ba85","amp;dn":"Roberto+Fonseca+-+Yo+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1739b883b468f8d712f2240b03866a0202f0ba85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,57,184,131,180,104,248,215,18,242,36,11,3,134,106,2,2,240,186,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
