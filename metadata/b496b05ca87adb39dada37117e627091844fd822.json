However, the formats vary, or the sizing is a mite large, or they forgot to do the .srt file. Since I have a commercial copy of the disc, I thought IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d offer my own. A few folks might enjoy it.\n\nThe creators of the disc offered a pair of choices ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ either rip each cartoon individually, or put the whole 17 cartoon collection out as a 2 hour film. Since nobody else has ripped it that way and provided the subtitles, I thought I would. Also, there were some requests to up the DVD vob files so people could burn their own copy, so I will do that next, also with subtitles. Thanks to the other folks who have made versions of this available.\n\n-Rambam1776\n\nMovie stills - http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk35/rambam1776/TheAntandtheAardvarkPinkPantherTVSe.jpg\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064033/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064033/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: The Ant and the Aardvark (Pink Panther TV Series).avi\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,016 KB or 734,224,384 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:47:58 (155,316 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 795 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 103 kb/s (51/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 416x320 (1.30:1) [=13:10] \n\nHere is the Wikipedia info:\n\nThe Ant and the Aardvark was a series of theatrical short cartoons produced at DePatie-Freleng Enterprises from 1969 to 1971.\n\nProduction\n\nThe cartoons were released by United Artists. Directors included Friz Freleng, George Gordon, Gerry Chiniquy, Hawley Pratt and Art Davis. 17 theatrical shorts were produced in the original series, these were subsequently featured in various television syndication packages, usually shown with DFE&amp;#039;s other characters such as the Pink Panther and the Inspector. The shorts were also reissued on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2007.\n\nPlot\n\nThe cartoon follows attempts of an unnamed blue aardvark (John Byner impersonating Jackie Mason) to catch and eat a red ant named Charlie (John Byner impersonating Dean Martin). However, in Rough Brunch, the aardvark states his name is indeed Aardvark. The ant has given him names as well, always beginning with &quot;Old&quot; (&quot;Old Sam,&quot; &quot;Old Ben,&quot;...etc.). In The Ant From Uncle, Charlie calls Aardvark &quot;Dad&quot; the entire episode. The Ant and the Aardvark was also the name of the first cartoon in the series. Like most DePatie-Freleng shorts, it contained a laugh track, a practice rarely used in theatrical short cartoons.\n\nIn the episodes I&amp;#039;ve Got Ants in My Plans and Odd Ant Out, the Aardvark tussled against a rival green aardvark, similar to the way Sylvester fought other cats over Tweety in a few of Freleng&amp;#039;s earlier shorts at Warner Brothers. Because many Warner alumni worked for DFE, a lot of familiar plots were recycled in the latter studio&amp;#039;s cartoons. In Technology, Phooey, the Aardvark utilizes a computer to help think up ideas to catch the ant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ very similar in concept to a Chuck Jones short with Wile E. Coyote. This cartoon also features yet another vocal impersonation from Byner, as the Paul Lynde-esque computer. Also, the last short ever made, From Bed to Worse, borrowed heavily from the Looney Tunes short, Greedy for Tweety.\nThere were many minor characters in the series. Among them was Cousin Term the Termite, the unnamed cousin ant, Aunt Minerva (Charlie&amp;#039;s Aunt), Tiny the Elephant, Tiger (voiced by Marvin Miller), the faceless scientist, the green aardvark, the unnamed nurse, the mischievous dog, the anteater-eating shark, the lifeguard who mistook Aardvark for a dog (he always said, &quot;OFF THE BEACH!&quot;), and an unnamed bear that always hurts Aardvark.\n\nFilmography\n\n1969\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Ant and the Aardvark (Friz Freleng) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tHasty But Tasty (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Ant From Uncle (George Gordon) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tI&amp;#039;ve Got Ants in My Plans (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tTechnology, Phooey (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tNever Bug an Ant (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDune Bug (Art Davis) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIsle of Caprice (Gerry Chiniquy) \n1970\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tScratch a Tiger (Hawley Pratt) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tOdd Ant Out (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAnts in the Pantry (Hawley Pratt) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tScience Friction (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMumbo Jumbo (Art Davis) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Froze Nose Knows (Gerry Chiniquy) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDon&amp;#039;t Hustle an Ant with Muscle (Art Davis) \n1971\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRough Brunch (Art Davis) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tFrom Bed to Worse (Art Davis) \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Aardvark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Aardvark&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b496b05ca87adb39dada37117e627091844fd822","amp;dn":"The+Ant+and+the+Aardvark+%28Pink+Panther+TV+Cartoon+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b496b05ca87adb39dada37117e627091844fd822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,150,176,92,168,122,219,57,218,218,55,17,126,98,112,145,132,79,216,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
