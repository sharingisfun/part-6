W. Tozer was well known in evangelical circles both for his long and fruitful editorship of the Alliance Witness as well as his pastorate of one of the largest Alliance churches in the Chicago area. He came to be known as the Prophet of Today because of his penetrating books on the deeper spiritual life.\n\nThe books\n\nThe Knowledge of the Holy: The Attributes of God: Their Meaning in the Christian Life\nThe Knowledge of the Holy by popular evangelical author and Christian mystic A.W. Tozer illuminates GodÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attributesÃ¢â‚¬â€from wisdom, to grace, to mercyÃ¢â‚¬â€and in doing so, attempts to restore the majesty and wonder of God in the hearts and minds of all Christians. A modern classic of Christian testimony and devotion, The Knowledge of the Holy shows us how we can rejuvenate our prayer life, meditate more reverently, understand God more deeply, and experience GodÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s presence in our daily lives.\n\nThe Pursuit of God: The Human Thirst for the Divine \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This thirst for an intimate relationship with God, claims A.W. Tozer, is not for a select few, but should be the experience of every follower of Christ. But, he asserts, it is all too rare when believers have become conditioned by tradition to accept standards of mediocrity, and the church struggles with formality and worldliness. Using examples from Scripture and from the lives of saints who lived with this thirst for God, Tozer sheds light on the path to a closer walk with God.\n\nGod's Pursuit of Man\nSalvation is from our side a choice, from the divine side [Ã¢â‚¬Â¦] a conquest of the Most High God. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A. W. Tozer\nWith words like these, Tozer shakes the soul. He crumbles the lies we believe and calls us to the more sure way.\nIn these pages, Tozer says what it means to truly be saved. It is not merely to assent to Jesus and go on our same old way, but to be conquered by the Almighty God and invaded by his Spirit. A saved person is a transformed person. Let Tozer upend you in this moving prequel to The Pursuit of God. And being upended, may you be found standing upright in an upside-down world.\n\nMan: The Dwelling Place of God\n&quot;As God's self-knowledge lies in the eternal Spirit, so man's self-knowledge is by his own spirit, and his knowledge of God is by the direct impression of the Spirit of God upon the spirit of man.&quot;\nIn the heart of every Christian is the dwelling place where the Triune God desires to fellowship with his people. Tozer explores this truth with brilliant insight and care for God's people. It is no wonder that this book has provided encouragement and comfort to Christians for over a century!\n\nThe Crucified Life: How To Live Out A Deeper Christian Experience\nDuring his lifetime, renowned teacher A.W. Tozer was often invited to speak at seminaries, churches, and Bible conferences on the topic of the cross and its meaning for the Christian life. Now, in this never-before-published distillation of his best teaching on the subject, you will gain a fresh understanding of the cross's centrality to your walk of faith in Christ.\nThe apostle Paul declared in his letter to the Galatians that he had been &quot;crucified with Christ.&quot; But what does this mean? Is this a claim every believer can and should make? The Crucified Life is a comprehensive examination of these questions, answered with the deep, biblical thinking for which Tozer was revered. &quot;God is ingenious in developing crosses for His followers,&quot; Tozer was fond of saying. At the heart of this book, you will find a call to follow Christ to the cross and be raised to new life--a call to live the crucified life.\n\nThe Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ\nThe Radical Cross is a thought-provoking book that will challenge you to make the cross your own and live the passion of Christ! This collection of Tozer's essays on the cross of Jesus Christ gives an in-depth look at the many meanings of the cross: Its Promise Its Price Its Purpose Its Pain Its Provisions Its Paradox\n\nMy Daily Pursuit: Devotions for Every Day\nOne of the 20th century's most inspiring writers has become a powerful voice for 21st-century Christians. Thanks to a treasure trove of never-before-published teachings from A.W. Tozer, author of the spiritual classic The Pursuit of God, you can spend an entire year strengthening your daily walk with God.

My Daily Pursuit is an invitation to spend a few minutes every day in the presence of Jesus, guided by one of His most trustworthy servants.\n\nExperiencing the Presence of God: Teachings from the Book of Hebrews\nDeep in the soul of every person on earth is a longing for the presence of God. But how do we get there?\nExperiencing the Presence of God is a never-before-published collection of teachings from A.W. Tozer on the book of Hebrews that shows us the way. Tozer, the renowned pastor and theologian, challenges our status quo, invites us to explore a fresh understanding of what it means to dwell in God's presence, and leads us to experience the divine fulfillment for which we were created!\nAs Tozer says, &quot;We should come to church not anticipating entertainment but expecting the high and holy manifestation of God's presence. . . . Worship is not some performance we do, but a presence we experience.&quot; Come alongside Tozer and enter into God's presence right now.\n\nMornings with Tozer: A 366 Day Devotional\nGrab your cup of coffee, find your favorite chair and begin your day with the wisdom of A.W.
