At present, there are four regional organizations or initiatives: the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral-Economic Cooperation, the Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation and the Mekong Ganga Cooperation Initiative. Arndt Michael examines the genesis and evolution of these organizations by using the theoretical perspective of norm localization. The study focuses especially on India Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a founding member in all four organizations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and traces the impact of India's foreign policy on the discourse, the development and the institutional designs of regional multilateralism.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f079c84e3e6266a3d9675c78577f1a0226e49f67","amp;dn":"India%27s+Foreign+Policy+and+Regional+Multilateralism+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f079c84e3e6266a3d9675c78577f1a0226e49f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,121,200,78,62,98,102,163,217,103,92,120,87,127,26,2,38,228,159,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
