Mathematical Methods and Statistical Tools for Finance, part of the Frank J. Fabozzi Series, has been created with this in mind. Designed to provide the tools needed to apply finance theory to real world financial markets, this book offers a wealth of insights and guidance in practical applications.\n\nIt contains applications that are broader in scope from what is covered in a typical book on mathematical techniques. Most books focus almost exclusively on derivatives pricing, the applications in this book cover not only derivatives and asset pricing but also risk managementÃ¢â‚¬â€including credit risk managementÃ¢â‚¬â€and portfolio management.\n\n-Includes an overview of the essential math and statistical skills required to succeed in quantitative finance\n-Offers the basic mathematical concepts that apply to the field of quantitative finance, from sets and distances to functions and variables\n-The book also includes information on calculus, matrix algebra, differential equations, stochastic integrals, and much more\n-Written by Sergio Focardi, one of the world's leading authors in high-level finance\n-Drawing on the author's perspectives as a practitioner and academic, each chapter of this book offers a solid foundation in the mathematical tools and techniques need to succeed in today's dynamic world of finance.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface xi\n\nAbout the Authors
