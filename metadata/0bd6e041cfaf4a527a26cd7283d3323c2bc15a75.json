In recent years, the band has been reconstituted at various points, and continues to perform occasionally.\n\nCrucial to their sound was their instrumentation; they were one of the relatively few rock acts of the time to adopt the twin keyboard approach (both an organ and a piano player).\n\nThey formed in October 1967, when Gary Wright joined the band Art. The band name Art only existed from April to October 1967. Art was renamed from The V.I.P.'s, as the name fitted better to the new musical direction taken on the album Supernatural Fairy Tales. Gary Wright held a significant role from the start. He wrote the majority of the first Spooky Tooth album, some even with record producer Jimmy Miller instead of band members.\n\nThe line-up changed several times, but typically was:\n\nMike Harrison (born Michael Harrison, 3 September 1945, Carlisle, Cumbria) (keyboards/vocals)\nGreg Ridley (born Alfred Gregory Ridley, 23 October 1947, Aspatria, Cumbria Ã¢â‚¬â€ died 19 November 2003, in Alicante, Spain) (bass guitar/vocals)\nLuther (Luke) Grosvenor (born Luther James Grosvenor, 23 December 1946, Evesham, Worcestershire) (guitar/vocals)\nMike Kellie, (born Michael Alexander Kellie, 24 March 1947, Birmingham, Warwickshire) (drums)\nGary Wright, (born Gary Malcolm Wright, 26 April 1943, Cresskill, New Jersey, U.S.) (organ/vocals)\n\nGary Wright was introduced to the members of Art by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.\n\n1969's Spooky Two LP was the last album release by the original lineup. It included the song &quot;Better By You, Better Than Me&quot;, which was covered by Judas Priest on their 1978 release Stained Class.\n\nRidley joined Humble Pie in 1969 and was replaced by Andy Leigh (in time for 1970's album Ceremony) who went on to Matthews Southern Comfort with ex-Fairport Convention vocalist Ian Matthews. The experimental nature of Ceremony received mixed reviews and following its release Wright also bowed out. The core of Harrison, Grosvenor and Kellie struggled on for one more album, The Last Puff, completed with friends from Joe Cocker's Grease Band, after which the band appeared in print ads for Birds Eye Pennsylvania Dutch style vegetables.\n\nThey broke up after a European tour in the autumn of 1970 that was undertaken with a lineup of Harrison, Grosvenor, Kellie, keyboardist John Hawken (ex-Nashville Teens) and bassist Steve Thompson. However, after recording solo efforts, Harrison and Wright decided to reform Spooky Tooth in September 1972 with a different line-up. The best known member of these line-ups (from March 1973 to September 1974) was Mick Jones (guitar / vocals), later in Foreigner. From February Ã¢â‚¬â€ May 1974, Mike Patto (vocals) replaced Harrison for the 1974 release The Mirror. The group then split again in November 1974","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd6e041cfaf4a527a26cd7283d3323c2bc15a75","amp;dn":"Spooky+Tooth%2FThe+Island+Years+%5B9CD%5D%5B1967-1974%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd6e041cfaf4a527a26cd7283d3323c2bc15a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,214,224,65,207,175,74,82,122,38,205,114,131,211,50,60,43,193,90,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
