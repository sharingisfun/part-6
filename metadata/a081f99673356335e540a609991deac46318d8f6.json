Follow the steps of Tarnum, a barbarian who, upon hearing from a bard about a tale that barbarians were once ruled the continent of Antagarich, unites the savage tribes and wages war on everyone. This renegade has to serve the ancient Ancestors (the Barbarian gods) to redeem his soul in order to be permitted into the Paradise, the barbarian Valhalla.\nVisit a plethora of places ranging from barren caves to lush jungles over the course of hundreds of centuries and several worlds. In the Elemental Plane, subjugate the Elemental Lords that want to conquer the real world. In the Underworld, deal with various powerful demons to retrieve a heroes soul--and more! Guide Tarnum through an epic story of struggle, success, defeat, and redemption, all in the awesome Heroes of Might and Magic universe.\n\nWhat's cool about it:\nSpinoff of the classic Heroes of Might and Magic series - 8 games, each a chapter of the immortal hero's story.\nDifferent atmosphere in each campaign - from arid, deserted wastelands to beautiful and lush forests.\nA fun, extensive, and addictive turn-based strategy experience that will keep you hooked up for many hours.\n\nOverview:\nEight titles featuring the gameplay you know and love from Heroes of Might and Magic III. Eight chapters that tell the story of Tarnum, a barbarian hero and liberator of his kinsmen.
