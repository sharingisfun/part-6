Sized to fit on a single DVD-R. The original 4-hour miniseries pilot is NOT included since that would've taken up too much space on the DVD-R.\n\nVideo: XviD, two pass VBR at 1000 kbps overall. 720x404, the highest non-anamorphic resolution possible for a 16x9 DVD rip.\nAudio: LAME 3.97b1, VBR preset Medium, downmixed to stereo from the 5.1 AC3 original.\n\nIn the interests of saving space, I cut out the &quot;previously on Battlestar Galactica&quot; retrospective at the beginning of each episode. I figure it's mainly there because you have a week between episodes on TV, you don't really have that problem here.\n\nCommentaries 9-13 are the original &quot;podcasts&quot; available on the Sci-Fi Channel web site, but there are a few DVD-only commentaries in there as well.\n\nHave fun waiting for the conclusion to &quot;Pegasus.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54804046ada9f359a0b33378617e6189e242c882","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+Season+1+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54804046ada9f359a0b33378617e6189e242c882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,128,64,70,173,169,243,89,160,179,51,120,97,126,97,137,226,66,200,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
