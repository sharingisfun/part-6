The plot\ninvolves a family wedding in working class Liverpool just after the second world war\nand the various episodes in the family's past dealing with their sometimes brutal\nand disturbed father. The beauty of the film lies in the deeply artistic composition\nof various shots, coupled with Davis' enduring compassion and understanding for the\ncharacters, especially the father played brilliantly by Pete Postlethwaite. It is an\nincredible evocation of family life and even though at times it makes for hard\nviewing, this is a film that must be seen. - (Dominic Maitland)\n\nEnglish subs (srt) included\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
