Perhaps even the best - although I have\nsome Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.\n\nI have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - \noften found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting their performance\nof this great work for you in this video and will have for you as well the mp3\noffering too. They seem always supremely competent with whatever material\nthey bring to us in the Classical genre.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0598081d9c6aec50cf3fc85146b92e9d74ce354c","amp;dn":"Vivaldi+The+Four+Seasons+I.+Musici+720p+HD+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0598081d9c6aec50cf3fc85146b92e9d74ce354c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,152,8,29,156,106,236,80,207,63,200,81,70,185,46,157,116,206,53,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
