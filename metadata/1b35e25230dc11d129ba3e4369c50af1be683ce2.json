This latest edition (SimPlates 2000 and 2004 came before) features over 30,000 REAL WORLD IFR PLATES - far more plates and at a higher quality than ever before. \n\nTake your flight simulator experience to the next level! \n\nOver 30,000 real-world IFR plates, including approach plates, SIDs/STARs, Airport Diagrams, and more. Approach types include ILS, VOR, VOR/DME, NDB, LLZ, SDF, GPS, TACAN, Helicopter, Visual, and more.  \n\nSuperb coverage: includes virtually every IFR plate for the USA and plates for hundreds of countries worldwide. [see complete list of included airports]  \n\nComplete, Integrated WORLDWIDE Airport/Facilities directory. Features useful information on the vast majority of the world&amp;#039;s airports, including many tens of thousands without instrument approaches. Also included as part of this is a fairly comprehensive worldwide directory of NAVAIDs (Navigational Aids) such as VORs and NDBs.  \n\nFor the USA, a complete list of preferred routing tables is included, so you can plan your virtual flights just like the pros do!  \n\nThis is a massive collection of data, totaling over 6gb - which is actually too much for a &amp;#039;standard&amp;#039; DVD. In fact, we&amp;#039;ve had to go to a special larger-capacity DVD format to fit it all on!  \n\nSimplates&amp;#039; friendly interface makes it easy to find exactly the plate or information you are looking for quickly, print it out, and have it ready for your virtual flight. Yes, SimPlates are meant to be printed, not viewed on screen (though it is theoretically possible to view them on-screen as well, as they come as PDF files, you will in practice find it easier to do as real pilots do and print them out to reference while you are simming).  \n\nSimPlates X is available now via download - both as a demo and the whole thing for purchase. Additionally, if you don&amp;#039;t think you want want to download around 6gb, you can pre-order the DVD, which we expect to ship (worldwide!) around the end of September.  \n\nRemember, SimPlates are ACTUAL IFR PLATES! However, pilots, please avoid all temptation and DO NOT USE THEM FOR REAL WORLD FLIGHT. This is because actual IFR plates have relatively short life spans, and thus the plates in SimPlates should be considered expired. However, they are still more than perfectly valid for simulator flying. \n\n\n============\nINSTALLATION\n============\n\n\n1.
