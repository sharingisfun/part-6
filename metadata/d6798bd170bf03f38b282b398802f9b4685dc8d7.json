Of these, only a tiny number could have pulled this recording off\nand none better than Keith Jarrett, one of the finest pianists we have working in any genre or idiom.\nThis isn&amp;#039;t jazz at all, but rather piano transcriptions of one man&amp;#039;s memories of central Asian Christian music.\nThe transcriptions are not artful, but this doesn&amp;#039;t stop them from shining like uncut gems.\nIf you can connect with these minor melodies, then you&amp;#039;ll find this recording exceptionally beautiful, as I do.\n\nTracklist:\n1.  Reading Of Sacred Books\t\t\n2.  Prayer And Despair\t\t\n3.  Religious Ceremony\t\t\n4.  Hymn\t\t\n5.  Orthodox Hymn From Asia Minor\t\t\n6.  Hymn For Good Friday\t\t\n7.  Hymn\t\t\n8.  Hymn For Easter Thursday\t\t\n9.  Hymn To The Endless Creator\t\t\n10. Hymn From A Great Temple\t\t\n11. The Story Of The Resurrection Of Christ\t\t\n12. Holy Affirming - Holy Denying - Holy Reconciling\t\t\n13. Easter Night Procession\t\t\n14. Easter Hymn\t\t\n15. Meditation\n\n\n\nEnjoy It!!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6798bd170bf03f38b282b398802f9b4685dc8d7","amp;dn":"Keith+Jarrett+-+G.I.Gurdjieff+-+Sacred+Hymns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6798bd170bf03f38b282b398802f9b4685dc8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,121,139,209,112,191,3,243,139,40,43,57,136,2,249,180,104,93,200,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
