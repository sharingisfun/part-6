She is a mystery that faithful Christians seek to understand more fully, an ocean full of grace still awaiting deeper exploration.\r\n\r\nIn A Year with Mary: Daily Meditations on the Mother of God, best-selling Catholic author Paul Thigpen sets sail on that ocean, using as his map the profound insights of saints and other spiritual writers. These 365 reflections, drawn from their writings, reveal Mary s role in God s plan, the virtues she so perfectly models, and the rich benefits of Marian devotion.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nPaul Thigpen, Ph.D., is the editor of TAN Books and the best-selling author, co-author or compiler of forty-three titles. Among his most popular books are Manual for Spiritual Warfare, The Burden: A Warning of Things to Come, and The Rapture Trap: A Catholic Response to â€œEnd Timesâ€ Fever. A convert to the Catholic faith, Paul has served the Church as an award-winning journalist, historian, apologist, catechist, and member of the National Advisory Council of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. His work has been circulated worldwide and translated into twelve languages. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d50ad9cbb9d818fa335d81c1988a5e8f27aab51","amp;dn":"A+Year+with+Mary%3A+Daily+Meditations+on+the+Mother+of+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d50ad9cbb9d818fa335d81c1988a5e8f27aab51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,80,173,156,187,157,129,143,163,53,216,28,25,136,165,232,242,122,171,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
