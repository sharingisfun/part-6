At the very least it makes for some nice background music.\n\n- Big Papi\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/haq8ptWFkX.jpg[/img]\n[quote]By &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;57323a3e3b2e2424173a32333e3638393279393223&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&quot;\n\nI take back everything I ever said about Nanci's MCA era records being worse than her Philo or Elektra recordings. This is not just the best Nanci cd, it's among the best live concert recordings ever made.\n\nFrom a &quot;little song written by Mister Patrick Alger&quot; (&quot;Once in a Very Blue Moon&quot;) to the red brick floor that came &quot;straight from the streets of Houston, swiped one night in a pickup truck...&quot; there's not a false note on this album.\n\nHer live versions of favorites like &quot;Working in Corners&quot; and &quot;Trouble in the Fields&quot; take the songs so far beyond what we ever knew they could be on the studio versions -- and they weren't half bad to begin with. The live version of &quot;Working in Corners&quot; is possibly my favorite song of all time.\n\nAny true Nanci fan will tell you, though, that the best part of this cd is the patter -- classic Nanci stories, from the tale of Great Uncle Tootie in the intro to &quot;Trouble in the Fields&quot; to the traveler's guide to Woolworth's stores that leads in to &quot;Love at the Five and Dime&quot; -- &quot;we were driving through central London and we came around the corner and by golly there was a Woolworth's store! And I wanted them to stop the car and let me out so I could go fill up my suitcase with unnecessary plastic objects!&quot; -- this is about as close as you can come to seeing Nanci in concert yourself. Better, even, sometimes, because she plays all the old hits, tracks like &quot;Roseville Fair&quot; and &quot;Deadwood, South Dakota&quot; (a really marvelous Eric Taylor tune) that you almost never hear in shows these days.\n\nThere's not much to say, except that this is truly brilliant. If you own one Nanci cd, it should be this one. But then, if you own this cd, it won't be your last Nanci cd, I'd wager. ;) There's no reason not to own this cd. It's among the must-haves for any lover of folk music -- of good music! -- of the latter part of the 20th century.\n[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/vpf3JxUPkW.jpg[/img]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Nanci Griffith - One Fair Summer Evening (MCAD 42255)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Nanci Griffith\nAlbum................: One Fair Summer Evening (MCAD 42255)\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988 11\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
