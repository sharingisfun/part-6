I wanted to begin sharing the workouts I used when I first began working out--workouts many other people swear by--Leslie Sansone&amp;#039;s Walk Away The Pounds series. \n\nThis DVD contains two workouts. The first is a 1-mile walk called Get Up and Get Started. The second is called High Calorie Burn 2 Miles. \n\nHere is an excellent description/review I found of the DVD on Amazon: \n\nLeslie Sansone won herself a whole new audience with the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs. These workouts are a wonderful way to get fit for people of all ages and fitness levels. This DVD features the 1-mile walk and the 2-mile walk. This DVD is the perfect introduction to Leslie&amp;#039;s walking workouts. \n\nThe moves are very simple: \n- knee lifts \n- kick backs \n- side steps \n- kicks \n- and of course, walking \n\nThe 1-mile walk runs 20 minutes. The 2-mile walk runs 31 minutes. If you&amp;#039;re just getting started, these workouts will fit into anyone&amp;#039;s schedule! \n\nOnce you&amp;#039;ve mastered the basic steps, she helps to create more intensity by stepping out further, squatting into the moves, and using light weights. While she promotes the &quot;Walk Away Weights&quot; in the DVD, light hand weights (2 - 3 pounds) can be substituted, just be sure to watch your form. \n\nA helpful meter appears along the way, to show you just far you&amp;#039;ve walked. Leslie&amp;#039;s warm demeanor and encouragement really keep you motivated to make it to that 1 mile or 2 mile marker. The other outstanding motivator in these workouts is her walking group: real people! Deb is in her 50&amp;#039;s, Randy is an older man, a new mother, and women in their 20&amp;#039;s and 30&amp;#039;s round out the walkers. \n\nThe workout can be customized to fit your lifestyle, and that is one of it&amp;#039;s greatest features. When you&amp;#039;re looking to work harder, squat down, push yourself, and use the weights. On days that you&amp;#039;re just not feeling 100%, skip the weights and still get a great cardio workout. \n\nIf you enjoy working out at home, this is a must-have workout. Thank you Leslie! \n\nI have six Leslie Sansone DVDs I plan on uploading. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f612742d076239db524e6743a859b2e53399ba14","amp;dn":"Leslie+Sansone--Walk+Away+The+Pounds+%28workout%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f612742d076239db524e6743a859b2e53399ba14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,18,116,45,7,98,57,219,82,78,103,67,168,89,178,229,51,153,186,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
