If Pavement's Brighten the Corners were coming out soon, I had to wait till release day to hear it. I would record a set of songs that I would want the Pavement album to sound like. Some of those songs ended up becoming Atlas Sound and Deerhunter songs years later.\n\nMy advice to those who are so desperate for AC's album to leak is to pick up instruments and make your own version of what you would want it to sound like. Respect the BANDS wishes and wait till release day. Then you can compare your new songs with theirs. Who knows. Maybe your album will be the one people are wanting to leak next year.&quot;\n\nTHIMK!\n\nI'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound\nSomeone's always yelling turn it down\nFeel like I'm drifting\nDrifting from scene to scene\nI'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87776dcfef80023aab580ca6587b74f30e5ab35f","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective+-+Merriweather+Post+Pavilion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87776dcfef80023aab580ca6587b74f30e5ab35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,119,109,207,239,128,2,58,171,88,12,166,88,123,116,243,14,90,179,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
