In this DVD a culmination of workshops recorded in Mexico, Florida, and Massachusetts plant specialist Eric Toensmeier introduces gardeners to more than 100 species of little-known, underappreciated plants. Ranging beyond the usual suspects (asparagus, rhubarb, and artichoke) to include such delights as ground cherry, ramps, air potatoes, the fragrant spring tree, and the much-sought-after, antioxidant-rich wolfberry (also known as the goji berry), Toensmeier explains how to raise, tend, harvest, and cook with plants that yield great crops and culinary satisfaction. Toensmeier also takes viewers on a plant-by-plant tour of his garden in Massachusetts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41956d3941874274f6fd3c47f3e90887aee92e96","amp;dn":"Perennial+Vegetable+Gardening+with+Eric+Toensmeier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41956d3941874274f6fd3c47f3e90887aee92e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,149,109,57,65,135,66,116,246,253,60,71,243,233,8,135,174,233,46,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
