The game definitely plays up its comic book roots, \ncomplete with readable sound effects and comic-book-like panels that pop up \nwhile you're playing. While it definitely has a certain sense of style to it, \nthe game itself misses its mark, and the total package isn't one that will hold \nthe interest of most first-person shooter players. \n\nXIII, or &quot;Thirteen,&quot; is both the name of the game and the name of the character \nyou'll play as, though there's definitely some question about your character's \nidentity. The game opens with you waking up with a gunshot wound after washing \nup on a beach, unable to remember anything at all. As you proceed through the \ngame, you'll begin to piece together your past, which is an interesting one, to \nsay the least. As it happens, you have the face of a man accused of \nassassinating the president with a sniper rifle. But are you, in fact, that \nman? Or are you an agent given a new face in an attempt to get to the bottom \nof the assassination conspiracy? The game attempts to answer these questions \nwith prerendered and in-engine cutscenes, as well as slightly interactive \nflashbacks that occasionally burst out in the middle of a level. While none of \nthese devices are particularly effective storytellers, the story has enough to \nit that you'll at least be interested in seeing it through, even in the face of \nXIII's rather rudimentary gameplay. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tMinimum Requirements:\n\n\n\tOs: \t\tWindows 98/ME/2000/XP\n\t\t\t(Operating System must be up to date with the \n                        latest patches)\n\tCPU: \t\tPentium 3 @ 800 MHz\n\tRAM: \t\t128 MB\n\tGPU: \t\t32 MB or better\n\tHDD: \t\t1.2 GB Free\n\tSound Card: \tDirectX 9.0c compliant soundcard, plus          \n                        speakers \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow to Install:\n\n\n\tSTEP 1:\t\tExtract file with 7z to anywhere you like.\n\t\t\t(note: Game will install to 'OS': Games XIII)\n\n\n\tSTEP 2:\t\tDouble click 'setup.exe' in 'Freeman' folder.\n\n\n\tSTEP 3:\t\tFollow on screen instructions!\n\t\t\t*DO NOT INTERRUPT PROCESS ONCE EXTRACTION HAS BEGUN*\n\n\t\n\tSTEP 4:\t\tStart game from Desktop. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tN'Joy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeman G Ripper\n\n\n\nI highly recommend you go check out the following sites: \n\n\twww.davidicke.com\n\twww.cuttingthroughthematrix.com\n\ttracker.conspiracycentral.net\n\n\ncheck out the forums!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment, play and leave feedback!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68adf136a76088d3d803a856de8bf0fd0283c10","amp;dn":"XIII+%28Thirteen%29+-+PC+Rip+by+Freeman+G+Ripper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68adf136a76088d3d803a856de8bf0fd0283c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,138,223,19,106,118,8,141,61,128,58,133,109,232,191,15,208,40,60,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
