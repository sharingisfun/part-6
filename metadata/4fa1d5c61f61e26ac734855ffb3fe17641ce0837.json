The desire to become the best actors bring teenagers to the darkest sides and go far beyond what is permissible ...\n\nReview: Matias Lira offers the viewer quite difficult for the film, if only because that theory kryuoticheskogo theater is not included in the compulsory program of cultural education. It is advisable to study it in advance because &quot;Drama&quot; - is both a self-contained story of the life of &quot;the three children, who think that life is theater,&quot; and filmed the transformation model of personality under the influence of dangerous techniques Artaud. It is quite familiar with another teensploitation flick called Kids\n\nInterestingly enough, as the director himself refers to &quot;kryuoticheskomu theater&quot; as &quot;Drama&quot; seems to give him a rather skeptical assessment. Structurally, the film is a disjointed stories of real life heroes, and the translation of these stories on stage. Lear succeeds in erasing the boundaries between theater and the street, and the blurring of the boundaries of personality, bringing to the fore not only provocative visual component of the film as a tragic psychological. Not everyone is able to destroy their identity completely, as required by the &quot;theater of cruelty.&quot; Someone in the Dionysian Sabbath reveal his true face, the other will hide behind masks all possible, and not feeling for it is the &quot;something&quot;, and the only one who reached the top kryuoticheskogo art and turned himself into a &quot;character&quot;, it risks being umervschlennym experience, can not survive it.\n\nNot only is the &quot;Drama&quot; is a complex theoretical construct and is made in a beautiful, but dark &quot;art-house&quot; style, so also the producing country is Chile, even very infrequent guest at international festivals. And yet, if you hit the movie, be sure to see, perhaps, of Mathias Lear once we hear more, as the next Latin star. The potential of it, I think there is.\n\normat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 746 MiB\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 311 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nBit rate : 1 176 Kbps\nWidth : 656 pixels\nHeight : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.203\nStream size : 670 MiB (90%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 72.9 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 83 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration : 504 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\nLanguage : Espanol","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa1d5c61f61e26ac734855ffb3fe17641ce0837","amp;dn":"DRAMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa1d5c61f61e26ac734855ffb3fe17641ce0837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,161,213,198,31,97,226,106,199,52,133,95,251,63,225,118,65,206,8,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
