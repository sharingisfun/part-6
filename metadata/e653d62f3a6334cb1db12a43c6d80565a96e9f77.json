Bird of paradise (2000 Re-Mix)------------------------------------------Terence Charles &quot;Snowy&quot; White (born 3 March 1948, in Barnstaple, Devon) is an English guitarist, mostly known for having played for Thin Lizzy (permanent member from 1979 to 1981) and for Pink Floyd (as a back-up player; he was first invited to join the band through Europe and the United States, in 1977) and, more recently, for Roger Waters' band. The collaboration with these two bands was very complicated; the invitation to rehearse the live show of The Wall for Pink Floyd happened at the same time he was invited to become a full-time member of Thin Lizzy, with whom he recorded/co-wrote their Chinatown and Renegade albums. Before his involvement in the Wall rehearsals and performances, he had played material for the guitar bridge between the two halves of &quot;Pigs On The Wing&quot; which only appeared on the 8-track tape version of Pink Floyd's 1977 Animals album (appearing as two separate tracks without the bridge on the vinyl LP and cassette versions), as well as playing with them during the 1977 In the Flesh tour.\n\nWhite's connection to Pink Floyd continued in later decades. White was invited by the then former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters to perform in another take of The Wall, in 1990, by the ruins of the Berlin Wall, along with other guest artists. Also in 1991 for the 'Guitar Legends' concert, in Seville, and with David Gilmour as the guest on Snowy's 1994 album Highway to the Sun, appearing on the track &quot;Love, Pain and Sorrow&quot;, with Gilmour playing his whammy-pedal induced Fender Stratocaster which was recorded at Gilmour's houseboat studio The Astoria.\n\nApart from guest appearances by Chris Rea, David Gilmour and Gary Moore, it also introduced two new Dutch-Indonesian musicians, Juan van Emmerloot (drums) and Walter Latupeirissa (bass and rhythm guitar). Kuma Harada also played bass and rhythm.\n\nWhite's next album project was entitled Gold Top, after his well-known Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Standard guitar. It features material in which White has been involved from as far back as 1974 right up to 1996, including two tracks from Thin Lizzy, jams from the Peter Green In the Skies session (with Peter on 2nd guitar), Al Stewart Live in Philadelphia (1974), and the only complete version of the Pink Floyd song &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; featuring White's original guitar solo.\n\nWhite has recorded five albums with his White Flames band. The first three were No Faith Required in 1996, Little Wing in 1998 and Keep Out: We Are Toxic in 1999 (see discography below).\n\nIn 1999 White joined Roger Waters for his band's In the Flesh U.S. tour, which was so successful that, in the Summer of 2000, Waters again toured the U.S., this time recording a live album and making a film of the show. Once again, from February to July 2002 White toured the world with Roger Waters.\n\nAnother White Flames album (as a three-piece), entitled Restless, was released in May 2002.\n\nSpring 2005 saw the release of a new White Flames album, entitled The Way It Is, with a basic four-piece outfit consisting of Richard Bailey (drums/percussion), Walter Latupeirissa (bass) and Max Middleton (keyboards). A DVD, 'The Way It Is...Live!' has been completed of the promotional tour.\n\nWhite is touring with Roger Waters in the current The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour since June 2006, having played in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South America. He also performed with Waters at Live Earth.
