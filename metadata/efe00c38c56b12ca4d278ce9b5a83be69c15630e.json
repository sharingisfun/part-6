Drunken loser Cahit (Birol Unel) drives his car into a wall; Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) slashes her wrists because she can't stand living with her traditional Muslim family. The two meet in the hospital and decide to join in a marriage of convenience in which he can get himself a cute young housekeeper and she can finally move away from home. They live together in Hamburg, where she begins to sleep around dangerously and he grows surprisingly jealous, leading to tragedy. Set to a soundtrack of 1980s music (Depeche Mode, Talk Talk, Sisters of Mercy), their lives continue to fall apart, lost to a world of lies and deception, drugs and violence, and emotional pain. Filmed on location in Germany and Turkey, HEAD-ON is an intense look at two lost souls who can't stand life as they know it. They spend a lot of time in clubs, trying to drink and dance away their troubles, but they seem doomed to constant failure and unhappiness. \n\nCast (Credited cast)\nBirol ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nel\t... \tCahit Tomruk\nSibel Kekilli\t... \tSibel\nCatrin Striebeck\t... \tMaren\nMeltem Cumbul\t... \tSelma (Cousine)\nStefan Gebelhoff\t... \tNico\nFrancesco Fiannaca\t... \tMann am Tresen\nMona Mur\t... \tStammkundin Zoe Bar\nRalph Misske\t... \tPatient 1 (Psychiatrie)\nPhilipp Baltus\t... \tPatient 2 (Psychiatrie)\nHermann Lause\t... \tDr. Schiller\nKarin Niwiger\t... \tKassiererin (Psychiatrie)\nDemir GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶kgÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶l\t... \tYunus GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ner (Vater)\nCem Akin\t... \tYilmaz GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ner (Bruder)\nAysel Iscan\t... \tBirsen GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ner (Mutter)\n\n************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
