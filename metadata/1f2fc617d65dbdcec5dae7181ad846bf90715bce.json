Starting with the first session in which the Ellington Orchestra sounds distinctive (&quot;East St. Louis Toodle-oo&quot; and &quot;Birmingham Breakdown&quot; from November 29, 1926) and progressing through the Cotton Club years, this essential release (which contains 67 performances) adds a few &quot;new&quot; alternate takes and rare items (&quot;Soliloquy&quot; and a few titles by the &quot;Six Jolly Jesters&quot;) to make this collection truly complete, at least for MCA's holdings (since Ellington also recorded for Columbia- and Victor-owned labels during the same period). With such major soloists as trumpeters Bubber Miley (and his replacement Cootie Williams), Freddy Jenkins, and Arthur Whetsol, trombonist Tricky Sam Nanton, clarinetist Barney Bigard, altoist Johnny Hodges, baritonist Harry Carney, and the pianist/leader, along with the classic arrangements/compositions, this set is essential for all serious jazz collections. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide \n\nTracklist:\n\n   DISC 1: 1926-28: \n\n  1.
