A young boy and his sister spend a summer at their grandparents' house in the country while their mother recuperates from an illness; they while away the hours climbing trees, swimming in a stream, searching for missing cattle, and coming to uneasy grips with the enigmatic and sometimes threatening realities of adult life. The fine, unsentimental attention to childhood incident, as well as the vignettish formal structure, recalls the work of Japan's Hiroshi Shimizu, a child-genre specialist of the 30s and 40s whose Four Seasons of Children this film closely resembles, though Hou's social concerns run deeper, and his spare, contemplative styling--the precise formal center around which a world accumulates--sets him squarely among the modernists. There's a slight sense of drift toward the end, as if Hou's personal, long-take certainty had momentarily deserted him, but otherwise it's a remarkably assured effort.&quot;\n\n-- Pat Graham, The Chicago Reader\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nDVD Rip\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.37 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 000 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate                         : 1 737 Kbps\nWidth                            : 608 pixels\nHeight                           : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.355\nStream size                      : 1.19 GiB (87%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nFormat profile                   : Dolby Digital\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 179 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 96 ms\nLanguage                         : Chinese\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d967f5c5e21d614a6fab0655180d04f6156bb8af","amp;dn":"A+Summer+at+Grandpa%5C%27s+%28Hsiao-hsien+Hou%2C+1984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d967f5c5e21d614a6fab0655180d04f6156bb8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,103,245,197,226,29,97,74,111,171,6,85,24,13,4,246,21,107,184,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
