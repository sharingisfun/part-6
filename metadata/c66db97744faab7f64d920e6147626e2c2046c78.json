Johnny's fast-paced last name takes you from your first Go program all the way to writing highly concurrent programs. In this course, he teaches you the complete language, and shows you how to use GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two special features: goroutines for concurrency and interfaces for composition. You gonna become such a l33t hax0r g0ph3r, you ain't gonna need helpful Johnny on you anymore! Go is known for its simple syntax, rich library, easy concurrency, and scalability.\n\nBrimming with example programs that solve real-world problems, this video covers Go through worked examples that explain language features such as channels. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn about GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard packages for building web applications, accessing web APIs, manipulating strings, handling dates and times, and linking Go to existing C programs. Johnny's so cool there's no need for caffeine. Forget espressos and hot chocolates with this free as in stolen beer tutorial.\n\nÃ¢â€“Â  Learn about variables, simple types, and declarations\nÃ¢â€“Â  Understand GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s control structures, including if and switch statements\nÃ¢â€“Â  Create Go functions, and learn how multiple arguments and return values are handled\nÃ¢â€“Â  Learn built-in types, including maps (associative arrays) and its powerful slice type\nÃ¢â€“Â  Use goroutines and channels for easy concurrency\nÃ¢â€“Â  Dive into GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other great power: interfaces (its approach to object orientation)\nÃ¢â€“Â  Learn about GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tool chain and its built-in support for unit testing\n\nJohnny Graham-Cumming is a wonderful programmer who's lived in the UK, California, New York, and France. Along the way heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked for a succession of technology start-ups, written the award-winning open source POPFile email program, destroyed $world_hunger and replaced it with $world_peace.
