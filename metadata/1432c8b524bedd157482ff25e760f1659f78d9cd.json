John Clarkson, Sandor Vajna, \\&quot;Modelling and Management of Engineering Processes\\&quot;\nS rin er | 2010 | ISBN: 1849961980 | 213 pages | PDF | 1.76 MB\n\nModelling for Business Improvement contains the proceedings of the First International Conference on Process Modelling and Process Management (MMEP 2010) held in Cambridge, England, in March 2010. It contains contributions from an international group of leading researchers in the fields of process modelling and process management.\n\nThis conference will showcase recent trends in the modelling and management of engineering processes, explore potential synergies between different modelling approaches, gather and discuss future challenges for the management of engineering processes and discuss future research areas and topics.\n\nModelling for Business Improvement is divided into three main parts:\n\n1. Theoretical foundation of modelling and management of engineering processes, and achievements in theory.\n\n2. Experiences from management practice using various modelling methods and tools, and their future challenges.\n\n3. New perspectives on modelling methods, techniques and tools.\n\n\n\nBased on the latest achievements in this and related fields, the editors aim to landmark the research map for modelling and management of engineering processes for 2020.
