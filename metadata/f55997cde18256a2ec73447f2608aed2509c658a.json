Whether the reader is in research, technology, business, or educationÃ¢â‚¬â€œthis book will show them how to take what could look like a really dry presenation and reinvigorate the material in totally fresh (and sometimes interactive!) ways that will make it memorable and resonate with the audience.\nStaying true to the mission of the first), Garr combines solid principles of design with the tenets of Zen simplicity to help readers along the path to simpler, more effective presentations that will be appreciated, remembered, and best of all, acted upon.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/3b/30/9bf651c88da08e5e4503d110.L._V192257244_SX200_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/3b/30/9bf651c88da08e5e4503d110.L._V192257244_SX200_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nGarr Reynolds is an internationally acclaimed communications expert, and the creator of the most popular Web site on presentation design and delivery on the net: presentationzen.com.Garr Reynolds is the best-selling author of Presentation Zen, Presentation Zen Design, and The Naked Presenter, and a leading authority on presentation design and delivery.
