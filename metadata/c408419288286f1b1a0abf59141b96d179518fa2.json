It engages students in:\n\nStarting analyses from fundamental principles rather than from secondary formulas.\nMaking macro-micro connections, based on the atomic nature of matter.\nModeling physical systems: making idealizations, simplifying assumptions, estimates. \nConstructing computational models to predict the time evolution of system behavior.\n\n20th century physics and a contemporary perspective are integrated throughout the curriculum.\n\nVolume 1: Modern Mechanics\nModern Mechanics emphasizes the atomic nature of matter and integrates traditional mechanics with thermal physics to provide a more coherent and contemporary perspective on the subject. There is strong emphasis on a small number of fundamental principles: the Momentum Principle (Newton's form of Newton's second law), the Energy Principle (which subsumes the first law of thermodynamics), the Angular Momentum Principle, and the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics, which leads to the second law of thermodynamics. The ball-and-spring model of solids plays a crucial role. Photon emission and absorption in quantized systems is included.\n\nVolume 2: Electric &amp; Magnetic Interactions\nElectric and Magnetic Interactions builds on the atomic nature of matter and the treatment of electric force and energy in Modern Mechanics with the addition of the field concept, Maxwell's equations, and the role of electrons in conductors and insulators. A thorough treatment of the effects of fields on atomic matter makes it possible to unify the analysis of electrostatics and circuits. The climax is the classical interaction of light and matter, followed by a discussion of the contrast between this wave picture and the photon picture developed in Modern Mechanics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c408419288286f1b1a0abf59141b96d179518fa2","amp;dn":"Matter+and+Interactions%2C+3rd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c408419288286f1b1a0abf59141b96d179518fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,8,65,146,136,40,111,27,26,10,191,89,20,27,150,209,121,81,143,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
