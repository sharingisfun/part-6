ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fulfilling and immensely economical process, one perfectly suited for our timesÃ¢â‚¬â€although, as Jones points out, cooking for one also means we can occasionally indulge ourselves in a favorite treat.\n\nThroughout, Jones is both our instructor and our mentor, suggesting basic recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as tomato sauce, preserved lemons, pesto, and homemade stockÃ¢â‚¬â€that all cooks should have on hand; teaching us how to improvise using an ingenious strategy of building meals through the week; and supplying us with a lifetimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of tips and shortcuts. From ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice for buying fresh meat to BeardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge to beginning crÃƒÂªpe-makers and Lidia BastianichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tips for cooking perfectly sauced pasta, JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book presents a wealth of acquired knowledge from our finest cooks.\n\nThe Pleasures of Cooking for One is a vibrant, wise celebration of food and enjoying our own company from one of our most treasured cooking experts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28afcd7f8eafc7a333f3f0769a75eb72994a4fb4","amp;dn":"The+Pleasures+of+Cooking+for+One%5Bmyebookshelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28afcd7f8eafc7a333f3f0769a75eb72994a4fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,175,205,127,142,175,199,163,51,243,240,118,154,117,235,114,153,74,79,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
