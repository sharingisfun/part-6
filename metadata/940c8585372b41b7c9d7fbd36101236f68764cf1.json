In the U.S. they had success in the early '70s with &quot;Sakura-Sakura,&quot; and their biggest hit was the fox trot &quot;Maria Helena,&quot; which won second place at the American charts and sold over one-and-a-half million copies. Their 48 LPs also sold millions of copies worldwide, and they toured South, Central, and North America, Asia, and Europe before settling in the U.S. Their eclectic act gathered Rimsky-Korsakoff, Chopin, De Falla, and Villa-Lobos with folk tunes and originals, performed in tuxedo and also half-naked with Indian ornaments. In the '60s, they also performed successfully at the San Remo Festival (Italy). Both self-taught musicians, they took their first contact with the violÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o (guitar) during their journey through the hinterlands of Cariri, CearÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, but had to give it away for a pound of beans. Having both studied music later, MuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§aperÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª was accompanied in the recording of his &quot;Their Very Special Touch&quot; by a full symphonic orchestra and vocal choir. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweamp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/11/los-indios-tabajaras/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/11/los-indios-tabajaras/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940c8585372b41b7c9d7fbd36101236f68764cf1","amp;dn":"Los+Indios+Tabajaras...20+Grandes+Exitos%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940c8585372b41b7c9d7fbd36101236f68764cf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,12,133,133,55,43,65,183,201,215,251,211,97,1,35,111,104,118,76,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
