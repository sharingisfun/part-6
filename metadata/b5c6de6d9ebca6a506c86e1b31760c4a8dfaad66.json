And there too are the Reverend Whoopsie (TIM CURRY), the incomprehensible Scottish Inspector McGuffin (BILLY CONNOLLY) and Sergeant Ken Russell (JIM PIDDOCK) and the case of the Houndsditch Mutilator.\n\nIdle calls What About Dick &quot;a hybrid.&quot; Its got elements of a musical - we have songs. Its got elements of a play, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a play that you have to take completely seriously because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sort of a send up. It has bits of stand up and improv and these hilarious comedians are playing multiple roles and doing impersonations&quot;.\n\n&quot;A comic free-for-all.&quot;\nTIM CURRY\n\n&quot;It's a huge laugh. It could rip your lungs out. People could watch this and laugh too much and die, so that's, that's the danger. It's actually dangerous to watch this...&quot;\nEDDIE IZZARD\n\n&quot;These people are people that live for laughter! They're dangerous people to be around. They'll do anything!&quot;\nRUSSELL BRAND\n\n&quot;The audience loves hearing those Python rhythms and that Python language... but we're adding ourselves to it too and going off in riffs of madness...&quot;\nTRACEY ULLMAN\n\n&quot;This cast is unique. You'll never see this cast together again doing something like this.&quot;\nERIC IDLE\n\n&quot;Everyone who watches it gets free glue for life!&quot;\nEDDIE IZZARD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c6de6d9ebca6a506c86e1b31760c4a8dfaad66","amp;dn":"Eric+Idle%27s+What+About+Dick+%282012%29+%5B192+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c6de6d9ebca6a506c86e1b31760c4a8dfaad66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,198,222,109,158,188,166,165,6,200,110,27,49,118,12,74,141,250,173,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
