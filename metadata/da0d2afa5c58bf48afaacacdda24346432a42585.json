Now in this two hour History Channel TV Special, his former student Wade Davis, follows in his footsteps to experience the discoveries that Schultes brought to the western world. Shot around the planet, from Canada to the Amazon, we experience rarely seen native hallucinogenic ceremonies and find out the true events leading up to the Psychedelic Sixties. Featuring author/adventurer Wade Davis (&quot;Serpent and the Rainbow&quot;), Dr. Andrew Weil, the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and many others, this program tells the story of the discovery of peyote, magic mushrooms and beyond: one man's little known quest to classify the Plants of the Gods. Richard Evans Schultes revolutionized science and spawned another revolution he never imagined.\n\n2 - One Step Beyond - the Sacred Mushroom - 1961\n\nJohn Newland along with doctors, and scientists took along a camera crew into the mountains of Mexico in search of the Sacred Mushroom. In one scene, a few Ã¢â‚¬Å“brujosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (native shaman) are encountered and agree to guide the party in a mushroom ceremony. In the next scene, John Newland is back in the states, and along with Dr. Andrija Puharich, several ESP tests are conducted on John before and after injesting the mushroom they call Ã¢â‚¬Å“XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This really is a facinating thing to watch considering this was series television (ABC) broadcast nationally in 1961Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ possibly one of the only times a psychedelic substance was injested and broadcasted.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0d2afa5c58bf48afaacacdda24346432a42585","amp;dn":"Drugs+Collection+-+Peyote+to+LSD+-+Sacred+Mushrooms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0d2afa5c58bf48afaacacdda24346432a42585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,13,42,250,92,88,191,72,175,170,202,205,218,36,52,100,50,164,37,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
