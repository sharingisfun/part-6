It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a mole ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam, Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiascoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nGenre: Thriller\nIMDB rating: 7.7/10 from 9,017 users\nDirected by: Tomas Alfredson\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Tom Hardy\n\nRelease Name: The.Girl.with.the.Dragon.Tattoo.2011.CAM.READNFO.Xvid-DTRG\nSize: 879 MiB\nVideo: XViD | 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272 | 871 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 2 hours 2 minutes\nSubtitle: English subs when and if required","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9729ac1ac069494ebd9d9f5f415265f62224f8","amp;dn":"Tinker+Tailor+Soldier+Spy+2011+DVDRIP+Xvid-BHRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9729ac1ac069494ebd9d9f5f415265f62224f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,151,41,172,26,192,105,73,78,189,157,159,95,65,82,101,246,34,36,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
