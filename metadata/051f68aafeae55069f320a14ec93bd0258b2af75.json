Each episode typically intertwined\n\nseveral plots involving an ensemble cast.\n\nThe show was created by Steven Bochco and David Milch and was inspired by Milch's relationship with Bill\n\nClark, a former member of the New York City Police Department who eventually became one of the show's\n\nproducers. The series was originally broadcast on the ABC network, debuted on September 21, 1993Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ and\n\naired its final episode on March 1, 2005. It remains ABC's longest-running primetime one-hour drama\n\n\nThis gritty, acclaimed crime drama from Steven Bochco elevated the genre and altered the boundaries of\n\nwhat network censors would allow. The series initially caused controversy with its frank language,\n\nrealistic violence and nudity, but it became a critical darling, garnering 27 Emmy nominations in its\n\nfirst year alone. There were many awards (and cast changes) through the years, but Andy Sipowicz\n\nremained its haunted soul for the show's unforgettable 12-year run.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne television show defined the police series genre in the Nineties: NYPD Blue, which first aired on\n\nSeptember 21, 1993, and ran until March 2005.\n\nMost television that is two decades old looks rather worn but NYPD Blue was such a strong programme that\n\nit has stood the test of time; it's still clear why it won nine Emmys, four Golden Globes and three\n\nScreen Actors Guild Awards. It ran for 12 seasons, and all are now available on DVD after a long-running\n\ndispute over rights was finally settled this year.\n\nThe series was created by David Milch and Steven Bochco and although the show was initially a vehicle\n\nfor David Caruso (as the main character, Detective John Kelly), he lasted only one full season after\n\nfalling out with his bosses. His replacement, Jimmy Smits (as Bobby Simone) was infinitely preferable.\n\nYet standing as the colossus throughout was Dennis Franz, as Andy Sipowicz (below), who dominated a\n\nshifting cast and was the only actor to appear in all 261 episodes. Franz, who had previously starred as\n\nboth Lt Norman Buntz and Detective Sal Benedetto on Bochco's Eighties cop show Hill Street Blues, plays\n\none of the best television detectives ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYPD Blue Cast\n\n\nName (Sort) Character (Sort)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Dennis Franz played Det./Sgt.
