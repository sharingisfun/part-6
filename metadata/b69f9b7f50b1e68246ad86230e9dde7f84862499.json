While there are still a handful of metallic rockers, III is built on a folky, acoustic foundation that gives the music extra depth. And even the rockers aren't as straightforward as before: the galloping &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is powered by Robert Plant's banshee wail, &quot;Celebration Day&quot; turns blues-rock inside out with a warped slide guitar riff, and &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; lumbers along with a tricky, multi-part riff. Nevertheless, the heart of the album lies on the second side, when the band delve deeply into English folk. &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; updates a traditional tune with a menacing flair, and &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; is an infectious acoustic romp, while &quot;That's the Way&quot; and &quot;Tangerine&quot; are shimmering songs with graceful country flourishes. The band hasn't left the blues behind, but the twisted bottleneck blues of &quot;Hats off to (Roy) Harper&quot; actually outstrips the epic &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; which is the only time Zeppelin sound a bit set in their ways.\n\n\nThe double vinyl version of Led Zeppelin III includes the original album (remastered) on one record with a second album of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcompanion audioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which features seven previously unreleased studio outtakes from the album as well as three previously unheard compositions: Jennings Farm Blues (an instrumental forerunner of Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp), Bathroom Sound (an instrumental version of Out On The Tiles), and their take on the blues classics Keys To The Highway/Trouble In Mind. Both records will be pressed on 180g vinyl and will come in a tri-fold sleeve that includes the wheel and die-cut holes from the original LP sleeve. The 2CD edition contains the same bonus audio as the deluxe vinyl and also has a sleeve with the wheel and the die-cuts\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69f9b7f50b1e68246ad86230e9dde7f84862499","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Led+Zeppelin+III+%282014%29+Deluxe+Edition+%5BIMAGE+SCA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69f9b7f50b1e68246ad86230e9dde7f84862499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,159,155,127,80,177,230,130,70,173,134,35,14,157,222,127,132,134,36,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
