Tracing the development of tactics, equipment and training, this book will give the reader an accessible yet detailed insight into the military force that enabled Rome to become the greatest empire the world has ever seen. Each of the four historical sections will focus on the changes in the army, but will also look at the talented men who transformed and led the army, such as Scipio Africanus, Caesar and Marcus Aurelius, and the momentous battles fought, including Cannae, Pharsalus, and Adrianople.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03717e68fabac5512ad1ce466119bda43faaad99","amp;dn":"The+Roman+Army+-+The+Greatest+War+Machine+of+the+Ancient+World+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03717e68fabac5512ad1ce466119bda43faaad99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,113,126,104,250,186,197,81,42,209,206,70,97,25,189,164,63,170,173,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
