The album covers were replaced with photographs of tape boxes and log sheet. The original album covers were included in a booklet which also featured a certificate of authenticity as this was a limited edition collection. Missing from this collection was all of the Beatles' singles that did not appear on their original UK albums.\n\nReleased with much anticipation in early October 1982, The Collection was lauded by critics and fans worldwide for the superb sound, and sold-out completely within the first year. MFSL repressed a second run of the Beatles Box Set for a total production run of 25,000 over the next two years or until October 1985. [2] Today, The Collection fetches up to $1,000.00 for a mint condition set on online auctions.\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_The_Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_The_Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nContents:\n\n   1.
