They knit while traveling or commuting, while waiting for their kids, while socializing. Times like these call for projects that are easily transportable and have stitch patterns that are simple to memorize. VÃ¯Â¿Â½ronik Avery has created 30 such projects for Knitting 24/7, a collection of stylish clothing and accessories that make use of those Ã¯Â¿Â½in-betweenÃ¯Â¿Â½ times when weÃ¯Â¿Â½re busy, yet our hands are free. Ranging from sweaters, scarves, and shrugs to hats and mitts, the projects represent both what women want to wear and what they actually have time to knit. The bookÃ¯Â¿Â½s gorgeous color photographs capture women in a range of settingsÃ¯Â¿Â½a morning at work, a dinner with friends, a relaxing weekend afternoonÃ¯Â¿Â½evoking the time of day when each wardrobe item might be worn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4991c989312c92dd354f160732b37e2b84d0a220","amp;dn":"Knitting+24%2F7%3A+30+Projects+to+Knit%2C+Wear%2C+and+Enjoy%2C+On+the+Go+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4991c989312c92dd354f160732b37e2b84d0a220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,145,201,137,49,44,146,221,53,79,22,7,50,179,126,43,132,208,162,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
