Abdelnour argues that the political and financial elites have done nothing to fix the structural problems and instead have worsened the situation. By creating more market bubbles, they are actually waging a war on the most productive members of society.\n\nFor investors, business people, and entrepreneurs that need to navigate the troubled geopolitical waters of the post-crisis world, Abdelnour offers several solutions, including looking at the world anew and understanding that the federal government's primary objective is to promote the creation of an environment conducive to the creation of wealth not job creation, not bailouts, not subsidies, not expansion of the federal bureaucracy, and not providing lifetime support to those who choose not to take advantage of the innumerable opportunities that exist in this nation for them to create a better, more productive life for themselves.\n\nWritten for investors that need to navigate the troubled geopolitical waters of the post-crisis world\n\nÃ‚Â· Offers &quot;out of the box&quot; investment tactics and strategies to outsmart the system\n\nÃ‚Â· Describes political and business solutions that anyone can engage in to restore freedom and prosperity\n\nThe author is President and CEO of Blackhawk Partners, Inc., a private family office that has two major lines of business, private equity investments and advisory services, and physical commodities trading\n\nCompelling and persuasive, Economic Warfare reveals that wealth can be created in the new, post-crisis world, but investors need to understand that the rules of the game have changed.\n\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\nAmerica was created to be a land of opportunity, where the individual could take an idea, develop it, and create wealth in the process. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with this notion. An enemy has arisen in our midst, one who has single-mindedly worked to subvert and even destroy this opportunity.\n\nSurprisingly, it is those we have elected and entrusted with managing our federal government and its burgeoningbureaucracies who are running the country into the ground. Operating under the arrogant delusion that theory is wiser than experience, they have given us an endless stream of programs. Instead of correcting our social ills, these programs have only exacerbated the problems and actually createdmore challenges due to the unintended consequences of incompetence, mismanagement, and corruption.\n\nAuthor Ziad Abdelnour, a financial veteran who's made acareer of empowering entrepreneurs and creating opportunities, has been on the front line of battle in this economic warÃ¢â‚¬â€a war between those who create wealth and those who believe they have some sort of divine mandate to appropriate it. Now, in Economic Warfare, Abdelnour lays out a plan for restoring economic freedom in the United States and around the world. Along the way, he reveals the true nature of the enemy that threatens to destroy the free market capitalist system that has made this nation great. He also shows where the weakening of our system began, how it was accomplished, and by whom. But unlike many books out there, Economic Warfare actually provides some strong and serious solutions for overcoming the forces against wealth creation, and lays out a strategy fornot only surviving in today's turbulent financial environment,but regaining the economic freedom that has marked American exceptionalism. For nearly one hundred years, we have allowed our public servants to operate based upon the theory that bigger government is better government, no matter the cost. That theory has nearly destroyed us.\n\nPage by page, Economic Warfare\n\nStrips away the veneer to reveal the true agenda behind our expanding central government\nDescribes the damage that has been inflicted upon the American economy in the last few years, making the case for the indisputable charge that we are involved inan economic war for survival\nDetails Abdelnour's personal strategies and vehicles for wealth creation, and outlines tools that can be used on a global scale\nGives a rundown of areas in which we, the people, can and must demand accountability and fundamental change from the next administration that moves intothe White House\nAnd much more\n\nArmed with the insights found here, you'll discoverwhy engaging in the wealth creation process, insteadof relying on big government and big business, is the best path to prosperity.\nFrom the Back Cover\nPraise For Economic Warfare\n\n&quot;Economic Warfare is a handy guide to global business practices. Just as politics is often war byanother name, global business is cut-throat competition by another name. This remarkable book offers insight, guidance, and a totally out-of-the-box way to think about international business competitiveness.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Herb London, President Emeritus, Hudson Institute\n\n&quot;This is a must-read book. Ziad simply and clearly emphasizes the crucial free marketprinciples that must be adopted by the United States if we are to avoid the coming requiem. The reader receives an education second to none explaining what success andthe creation of wealth truly derive from. The result of this counsel is prosperity.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Victor Sperandeo (Trader Vic), CEO and President, Alpha Financial Technologies, LLC\n\n&quot;Ziad Abdelnour is an independent thinking libertarian who applies Milton FriedmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike concepts in this book to his daily life. The man embodies the American Spirit and in this masterpiece he explains very complex financial concepts in an easy-to-read and understandable language. As the founder of the worldwide CEO Clubs and author of twenty-six books . . .when I say 'read this book'Ã¢â‚¬â€DO IT. It is impactful and a must-read.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Joe Mancuso, founder and President, CEO Clubs\n\n&quot;The words that come to mind after reading this book are courage and truth. The question is, do you have the courage to hear the truth? Economic Warfare rips the lid off the story of the centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€that our country has been embezzled and defrauded by a cabal of Ivy League gangsters, greedy bankers, financial terrorists, and vulture capitalists. They managed to turn Wall Street and the banking system into a combined craps game, shell game, and Ponzi schemeÃ¢â‚¬â€all set up for the benefit of the few (bankers), to be subsidized by the many (taxpayers). Bernanke, Rubin, Paulson, SummersÃ¢â‚¬â€all the star swindlersÃ¢â‚¬â€are exposed in Economic Warfare. This is the book the bankers, hedge fund managers, and D.C. political insiders fear.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Wayne Allyn Root, CEO, entrepreneur, and bestselling author ofThe Conscience of a Libertarian, former vice presidential candidate andChairman of the Libertarian National Congressional Committee\n\n&quot;Economic Warfare: Secrets of Wealth Creation in the Age of Welfare Politics isthe new bible of how to make a ton of doughÃ¢â‚¬â€even in these difficult times.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€John LeBoutillier, former U.S. Congressman (RÃ¢â‚¬â€œNY) and author of Harvard Hates America\n\n&quot;In his eye-opening book Economic Warfare: Secrets of Wealth Creation in the Age of Welfare Politics, Ziad Abdelnour exposes the massive fraud being perpetrated on the American people by Wall Street insiders. And, as a libertarian and true believer in free markets, he offers solutions for both the United States and individual citizens when it comes to real wealth creation.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Robert Ringer, Publisher of A Voice of Sanity and author of Restoring the American Dream: The Defining Voice in the Movement for Liberty\nAbout the Author\nZiad K.
