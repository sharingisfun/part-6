A. Mansuelli\n\n57 illustrations in full color, 15 illustrations in black and white\n\nWhat substance is there in the famous, almost legendary &quot;originality&quot; of Etruscan art? The question has been discussed for years. In this book Professor Mansuelli recognizes the &quot;Villanova geometric style&quot; as the matrix from which all subsequent Etruscan art was drawn. He emphasizes the importance of Greek influences, with the proviso that too close a relationship must not be looked for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f68605c28a16a543d082862af5edf7b754487c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Etruria+and+early+Rome+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f68605c28a16a543d082862af5edf7b754487c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,246,134,5,194,138,22,165,67,208,130,134,42,245,237,247,183,84,72,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
