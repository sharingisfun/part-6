This stunning exposÃ© reveals for the first time how Bill and Hillary Clinton systematically abused women and othersâ€”sexually, physically, and psychologicallyâ€”in their scramble for power and wealth.\r\n\r\nIn this groundbreaking book, New York Times bestselling author Roger Stone and researcher and alternative historian Robert Morrow map the arc of Bill and Hillaryâ€™s crimes and cover-ups. They reveal details about their actions in Arkansas, during Bill Clintonâ€™s time in the White House, about who really ordered the deadly attack on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, during Hillaryâ€™s tenure as secretary of state, about their time at the Clinton Foundation, and during Hillaryâ€™s current campaign for president.\r\n\r\nThis is the first book to shed light on the coupleâ€™s deeply personal violations of the people they crushed in their obsessive quest for power. Along the way, Stone and Morrow reveal the familyâ€™s darkest secrets, including a Clinton family memberâ€™s drug rehab treatment that was never reported by the press, Hillary Clintonâ€™s unusually close relationship with a top female aide, and a stunning revelation of such impact that it could strip Bill Clinton of his current popularity and derail Hillaryâ€™s push to be the second Clinton in the White House.\r\n\r\nAnyone who cares about the future of the United States will want to read this tell-all, exposing the appalling, unvarnished, and ugly truth about the Clintons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a597f3a793a5f72aab9c5bb2398e5754a69875cb","amp;dn":"Roger+Stone+-+The+Clintons%27+War+on+Women+2015+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a597f3a793a5f72aab9c5bb2398e5754a69875cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,151,243,167,147,165,247,42,171,156,91,178,57,142,87,84,166,152,117,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
