The group began at least as a tribute to the playful yet heavy psychedelic pop scene that flourished in Cambodia before Pol Pot came to power and silenced countless suspected dissidents in that country's infamous killing fields in the mid-1970s. Like the Cambodian pop music that so enamored them, Dengue Fever began by revitalizing strong elements of '60s surf and garage rock in their sound. Over time, they've expanded their influences to Ethiopian funk and modern dance-rock. Once a multi-culti California band with a Cambodian-born singer paying homage to the past, Dengue Fever now plays original, swirling, psychedelic pop. With Western audiences ever more open to hybrid sounds, it will be a huge surprise if Venus on Earth doesn't allow Dengue Fever to quit their day jobs for good, especially after the film about their trip to Cambodia, Sleepwalking through the Mekong, hits the festival circuit in 2008\n-- amazon.com\n\nSexy and eclectic, it's world music for the cool kids.\n-- LA Times\n\nThis transcends the sometimes dubious genre of world music in every sense.\n-- PopMatters\n\nVenus on Earth feels impulsive and rich, rippling with surf psychedelia and exultant brass swing.\n-- Spin\n\nTracks\n01- Seeing Hands\n02- Clipped Wings\n03- Tiger Phone Card\n04- Woman in the Shoes\n05- Sober Driver\n06- Monsoon of Perfume\n07- Integration\n08- Oceans of Venus\n09- Laugh Track\n10- Tooth and Nail\n11- Mr. Orange\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c248e06952b3678c9d47d53a96e7dd0eebde9f8c","amp;dn":"Dengue+Fever+-+Venus+on+Earth+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c248e06952b3678c9d47d53a96e7dd0eebde9f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,72,224,105,82,179,103,140,157,71,213,58,150,231,221,14,235,222,159,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
