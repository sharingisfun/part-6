On I Feel Cream she does it again, this time producing, along with the likes of Simian Mobile Disco, Soulwax, Digitalism, and Drums Of Death, her most pop-sounding album to date. The beats remain as harsh and uncompromising as ever, but with a new found melodic groove that has only been previously hinted at.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aff9b467784bf3729cd82d75a40ddc49d181953","amp;dn":"Peaches+-+I+Feel+Cream+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aff9b467784bf3729cd82d75a40ddc49d181953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,255,155,70,119,132,191,55,41,205,130,215,90,64,221,196,157,24,25,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
