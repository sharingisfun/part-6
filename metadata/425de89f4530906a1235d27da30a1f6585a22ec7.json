But the mastermind behind this job is none other than Popeye's old partner Macau Park, who escaped with 68kg of gold several years ago on their last job together. Macau Park brought Chinese thieves as well but little did they know what Macau Park planned for each one of them. His plan takes an unexpected turn when Popeye brings Pepsi, a genius safe-cracker and old flame of Macau Park, to settle the old score. The thieves' target is a $20 million diamond known as 'Tear of the Sun', kept safely away in a casino, brought there to be sold by a notorious Chinese fence. While working together to steal this fabled diamond, they all have their own agenda to keep the diamond for themselves. But who will succeed and live to see another day?\n\n\nGeneral\n\n       \nFormat.......: Matroska\nFile Size....: 3.04 GiB\nDuration.....: 2h 15mn\nBitrate......: 3 199 Kbps\nSubtitles....: English\nEncoder&quot;.......JYK\nSource.......: BluRay\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2330866/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2330866/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nVideo Format......: AVC\nVideo Codec.......: x264 core 129 r2230 1cffe9f        \nBitrate...........: 2 750 Kbps\nFrame Rate........: 24.000 fps\nWidth.............: 1 280 pixels\nHeight............: 544 pixels\naspect ratio......: 2.35:1\n\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat..........: AC-3\nBitrate.........: 448 Kbps\nChannels........: 6 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Korean\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8635/thethieves2012720pbrrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425de89f4530906a1235d27da30a1f6585a22ec7","amp;dn":"The.Thieves.2012.720p.BRRip.x264.AC3-JYK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425de89f4530906a1235d27da30a1f6585a22ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,93,232,159,69,48,144,106,18,53,210,125,163,10,31,101,133,162,46,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
