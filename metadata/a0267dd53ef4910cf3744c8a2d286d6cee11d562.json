Field trips to hot-air balloon events, symphony concerts, bicycle shops, and other locales make complex concepts more accessible. Inventive computer graphics illustrate abstract concepts such as time, force, and capacitance, while historical re-enactments of the studies of Newton, Leibniz, Maxwell, and others trace the evolution of theories. The Mechanical Universe helps meet different students' needs, from the basic requirements of liberal arts students to the rigorous demands of science and engineering majors. This series is also valuable for teacher professional development.\n\n\n\n\n5)  Vectors \nPhysics must explain not only why and how much, but also where and which way. Physicists and mathematicians invented a way of describing quantities that have direction as well as magnitude. Laws that deal with such phenomena as distance and speed are universal. And vectors, which describe quantities such as displacement and velocity, universally express the law of physics in a way that is the same for all coordinate systems.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1607 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 528\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (4:3)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 52\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mechanical_Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mechanical_Universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0267dd53ef4910cf3744c8a2d286d6cee11d562","amp;dn":"The+Mechanical+Universe+and+Beyond+05of52+Vectors+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0267dd53ef4910cf3744c8a2d286d6cee11d562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,38,125,213,62,244,145,12,243,116,76,138,45,40,109,108,238,17,213,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
