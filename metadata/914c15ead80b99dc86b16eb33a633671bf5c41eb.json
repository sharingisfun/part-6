What does this unavoidable fact mean?\n\n For future generations, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean anything very obvious. They will be so immersed in online life that questions about the InternetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic purpose or meaning will vanish.\n\n But those of us who have lived both with and without the crowded connectivity of online life have a rare opportunity. We can still recognize the difference between Before and After. We catch ourselves idly reaching for our phones at the bus stop. Or we notice how, mid-conversation, a fumbling friend dives into the perfect recall of Google.\n\n In this eloquent and thought-provoking book, Michael Harris argues that amid all the changes weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re experiencing, the most interesting is the one that future generations will find hardest to grasp. That is the end of absenceÃ¢â‚¬â€the loss of lack. The daydreaming silences in our lives are filled; the burning solitudes are extinguished. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no true Ã¢â‚¬Å“free timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when you carry a smartphone. TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rarest commodity is the chance to be alone with your own thoughts.\n\n To understand our predicament, and what we should do about it, Harris explores this Ã¢â‚¬Å“loss of lackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in chapters devoted to every corner of our lives, from sex and commerce to memory and attention span. His book is a kind of witness for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“straddle generationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€a burst of empathy for those of us who suspect that our technologies use us as much as we use them.\n\n By placing our situation in a rich historical context, Harris helps us remember which parts of that earlier world we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to lose forever. He urges us to look upÃ¢â‚¬â€even brieflyÃ¢â‚¬â€from our screens. To remain awake to what came before. To again take pleasure in absence.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:914c15ead80b99dc86b16eb33a633671bf5c41eb","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Absence%3A+Reclaiming+What+We%26rsquo%3Bve+Lost+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"914c15ead80b99dc86b16eb33a633671bf5c41eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,76,21,234,216,11,153,220,134,177,110,179,58,99,54,113,191,92,65,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
