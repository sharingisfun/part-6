The text provides undergraduate students with a broad foundation for more detailed study of the subdisciplines of human movement and for cross-disciplinary studies. Readers will learn the multi-dimensional changes in movement and movement potential that occur throughout the life span as well as those changes that occur as adaptations to training, practice, and other lifestyle factors.\n\nThis third edition includes the latest research and improved presentation to address areas of growth and change in the fields of human movement. The following are important updates to this edition:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A new chapter on historical origins of human movement science provides students with an appreciation of the development of the field as well as its future directions.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Content regarding exercise physiology has been reorganized to provide more discrete coverage of key concepts in nutrition.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A new concluding section focuses on applications in the areas of prevention and management of chronic disease, prevention and management of injury, and performance enhancement in sport and the workplace, as well as the benefits of sport and exercise science to work, sport, and everyday living.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ancillary materials support instructors in teaching across disciplines as they assist students in understanding the breadth of content in this comprehensive text.\n\nThe third edition offers a comprehensive introduction for students, scientists, and practitioners involved in the many professions grounded in or related to human movement, kinesiology, and sport and exercise science. By considering the effect of adaptations in each of the biophysical subdisciplines of human movement, Biophysical Foundations of Human Movement also illustrates the important role physical activity plays in the maintenance of health throughout the life span. \n\nAbout the Authors\nBruce Abernethy, PhD, is professor of human movement science in the School of Human Movement Studies and deputy executive dean and associate dean (research) in the faculty of health sciences at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.\nStephanie J. Hanrahan, PhD, is a registered sport psychologist and an associate professor in the Schools of Human Movement Studies and Psychology at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.
