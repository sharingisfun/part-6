Niets is te gek. Er gebeurt altijd van alles in de familie van vader Peter Griffin. Maar het is voornamelijk chaos en wanorde die heersen. De jongste van de drie kinderen in de familie, Stewie, is een duivels mannetje die een moordaanslag niet uit de weg gaat als ie zijn zin niet krijgt. De hond Brian mengt zich in de conversaties want hij kan praten, rookt sigaretjes en drinkt een martini op zijn tijd. En moeder is de enige stabiele factor in het gezin en daarom vaak het middelpunt van spot en grappen. Eigenlijk heeft Family Guy geen vaste verhaallijn behalve dat er altijd bizarre en enorm lachwekkende situaties zijn. Die doorgaans beginnen met een mooi plan van vader Peter wat bijna altijd desastreus uitpakt voor hem en zijn familie. Family Guy is inmiddels een klassieke comedy serie die elke keer weer verrast met bizarre wendingen en de meest originele grappen.\n\n\nSeizoen 8:\n\n\n\nSeizoen 8 Aflevering 1: Road to the Multiverse\nStewie and Brian explore a series of alternate universes.\n\n\n\t\nSeizoen 8 Aflevering 2: Family Goy\nWhen Peter and Lois find out that Lois' mother was a Holocaust survivor, Peter decides that the Griffins will adopt the Jewish faith, until a vision of his dead father changes his mind.\n\n\n\t\nSeizoen 8 Aflevering 3: Spies Reminiscent of Us\nWith the help of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, Stewie and Brian discover that mayor Adam West is a Cold War sleeper agent.
