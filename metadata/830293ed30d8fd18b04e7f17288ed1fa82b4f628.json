This is Terry Gilliam's satirical dry-run for Brazil (1985), and even more bluntly political.\n\nThis should be the theme-short of The Pirate Bay. A team of geriatric accountants, mistreated by their new bosses, revolt and turn pirate, sailing their office building out into the metropolis and raiding banks etc; filing cabinets are used as cannons. Great fun, and with a real bite.\n\nimdb tt0215685","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830293ed30d8fd18b04e7f17288ed1fa82b4f628","amp;dn":"The+Crimson+Permanent+Assurance+%281982%29+Terry+Gilliam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830293ed30d8fd18b04e7f17288ed1fa82b4f628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,2,147,237,48,216,253,24,176,78,127,23,40,142,209,250,130,180,246,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
