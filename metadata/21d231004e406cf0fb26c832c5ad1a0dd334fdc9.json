The place is aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz, America's mightiest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly, a freak electrical storm engulfs the ship and triggers the impossible: The Nimitz is hurtled back in time to December 6, 1941, mere hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAs the enemy fleet speeds towards Hawaii, the warship's Captain, a Defense Department expert, a maverick Air Wing Commander and a desperate Senator in the Roosevelt administration must choose between the unthinkable.
