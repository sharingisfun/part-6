Formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1988 following the demise of Green River, Mudhoney's members are vocalist and rhythm guitarist Mark Arm, lead guitarist Steve Turner, bassist Guy Maddison, and drummer Dan Peters. Original bassist Matt Lukin left the band in 1999 but briefly returned in December 2000 to complete touring obligations. Mudhoney's early releases on Sub Pop, particularly debut single &quot;Touch Me I'm Sick&quot; and the Superfuzz Bigmuff EP, were massively influential on the Seattle music scene, helping more than almost any other releases of the era to inspire the dirty, high-distortion sound that would become grunge. Mudhoney was also notable for its mixing of heavy blues rock and punk rock. Although the band has found little commercial success during its long career, which has yielded 10 studio albums, it nonetheless inspired many grunge and alternative rock musicians. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Mudhoney :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65a5bad42271fa51e87733f8af7735136e35e2c","amp;dn":"Mudhoney+-+5+Albums+1988+-+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65a5bad42271fa51e87733f8af7735136e35e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,90,91,173,66,39,31,165,30,135,115,63,138,247,115,81,54,227,94,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
