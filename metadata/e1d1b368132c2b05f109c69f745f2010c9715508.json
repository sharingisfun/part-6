Hinduism does not lend itself easily to a strictly chronological account. Many of its central texts cannot be reliably dated within a century; its central tenets arise at particular moments in Indian history and often differ according to gender or caste; and the differences between groups of Hindus far outnumber the commonalities. Yet the greatness of Hinduism lies precisely in many of these idiosyncratic qualities that continues to inspire debate today. This groundbreaking work elucidates the relationship between recorded history and imaginary worlds, the inner life and the social history of Hindus.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;Don't miss this equivalent of a brilliant graduate course froma feisty and exhilarating teacher.&quot;\n-The Washington Post \n\nThe torrent folder contains the original retail quality EPUB and MOBI copies of the paperback edition, as well as conversions into LIT, AZW3 and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
