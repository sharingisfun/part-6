That Mancuso is distantly related to vice cop Joe Morelli - who is trying to beat Stephanie to the punch - only makes the hunt more thrilling...\r\n\r\nTaking pointers from her bounty hunter pal, Ranger, and using her pistol packing Grandma Mazur as a decoy, Stephanie is soon closing in on her mark. But Morelli and his libido are worthy foes. And a more sinister kind of enemy has made his first move... and his next move might be Stephanie's last","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ba5d0fa270f82b8c4fc558f5ea69c5a74ba9eb","amp;dn":"Janet+Evanovich-Two+for+the+Dough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ba5d0fa270f82b8c4fc558f5ea69c5a74ba9eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,186,93,15,162,112,248,43,140,79,197,88,245,234,105,197,167,75,169,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
