In ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Superbank, Bloomberg authors Michael Forsythe and Henry Sanderson outline how the bank is at the center of China's domestic economic growth and how it is helping to expand China's influence in strategically important overseas markets.\n\n100 percent owned by the Chinese government, the CDB holds the key to understanding the inner workings of China's state-led economic development model, and its most glaring flaws. The bank is at the center of the country's efforts to build a world-class network of highways, railroads, and power grids, pioneering a lending scheme to local governments that threatens to spawn trillions of yuan in bad loans. It is doling out credit lines by the billions to Chinese solar and wind power makers, threatening to bury global competitors with a flood of cheap products. Another $45 billion in credit has been given to the country's two biggest telecom equipment makers who are using the money to win contracts around the globe, helping fulfill the goal of China's leaders for its leading companies to &quot;go global.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:928c398935b9b294c68b6a57fd603a151b20d1be","amp;dn":"China%27s+Superbank%3A+How+China+Development+Bank+is+Rewriting+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"928c398935b9b294c68b6a57fd603a151b20d1be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,140,57,137,53,185,178,148,198,139,106,87,253,96,58,21,27,32,209,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
