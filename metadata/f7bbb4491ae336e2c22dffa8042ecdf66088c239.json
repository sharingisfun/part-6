So whereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that leave Dean Martin? Who knows? Who cares? The manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in American popular culture is forever secure. Rat Pack. Handsome. Martin and Lewis. Golf. TV. The whole 18 holes. So, the double disc Dino: The Essential Dean Martin and its more compact companion, Classic Dino: The Best of Dean Martin, are probably not going to offer you anything you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expecting. Martin was a charming guy with a good voice who recorded some memorable songs, and attempts at deeper analysis seem almost heretical for a man who made his name in an era where the illusion of glamour, immortality, and star power (read: the superficiality of celebrity) reigned supreme.\n\nThe stuff the casual listenerÃ¢â‚¬â€the dame or dude who, like me, wants to have some Dino on hand for holidays and dinner partiesÃ¢â‚¬â€really wants what occupies the single disc Classic Dino set. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all thereÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AmoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t That a Kick in the HeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Volare (Nel Blu Di Pinto Di Blue)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Nobody Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil Somebody Loves YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€and each reveals MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncanny ability to lend warmth to a simple melody and make us unashamed to embrace lyrics that ask us to believe in the impossible and smile all the while. \n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/ffa8/21d839ab0.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7bbb4491ae336e2c22dffa8042ecdf66088c239","amp;dn":"Dean+Martin+-+The+Best+Of+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7bbb4491ae336e2c22dffa8042ecdf66088c239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,187,180,73,26,227,54,226,194,45,255,168,4,46,205,246,96,136,194,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
