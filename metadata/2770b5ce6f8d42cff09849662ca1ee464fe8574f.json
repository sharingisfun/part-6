Their sound is diverse as their members, ranging from soaring worship anthems to powerful ballads, mixed in with folk influences and even a bit of gospel soul. What started as a dream, now has found its expression in a destiny-driven group of friends spanning this nation. Band member Nathan Fray states their purpose clearly: &quot;Our mission is to create a culture of worship and of hosting God's presence, all centered around community living. It's in this place of God's life-giving presence that our songs are born and we pray will stir the heart of a generation to love Jesus and pursue Him with everything. This is our united pursuit.&quot;\n\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - June 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2770b5ce6f8d42cff09849662ca1ee464fe8574f","amp;dn":"United+Pursuit+Band+Discography+2008-2011+%285+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2770b5ce6f8d42cff09849662ca1ee464fe8574f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,112,181,206,111,141,66,207,240,152,73,102,44,161,238,70,79,232,87,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
