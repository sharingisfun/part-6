And there's more to recommend it than simply the lovely lo-fi production (Jack White eat yer heart out) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there's conviction in the performance and strong songs to back it up. In a genre that, these days, has a tendency to slip into dreary clichÃƒÂ©, The Black Keys should be applauded for keeping things interesting.\n\nSo this is a blues album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to dress it up as anything else would be to miss its point. But that shouldn't put off the casual listener. As well as the more trad-sounding opener, and tracks such as &amp;quot;Stack Shot Billy&amp;quot; (whose guitar wouldn't sound out of place on a John Lee Hooker record), you get the beautiful, mournful &amp;quot;The Lengths&amp;quot; and rockers such as &amp;quot;All Hands Against His Own&amp;quot; and the album's rousing closer, &amp;quot;Till I Get My Way&amp;quot;. All in all, proof that the blues can still be relevant today, even if a sizeable proportion of its originators are now no longer with us. --Marc Bloomfield\n\nAlbum Description\nRubber Factory is the second album from the acclaimed guitar and drum, delta blues-infused rock duo from Akron, Ohio, The Black Keys. Their first release, Thickfreakness, was a massive hit in the UK and got great reviews in the music press. \n\n58MB, mp3@192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d514cdc69e9bd092fbf719fc6a577a8fb717d4d2","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Rubber+Factory+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d514cdc69e9bd092fbf719fc6a577a8fb717d4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,20,205,198,158,155,208,146,251,247,25,252,106,87,122,143,183,23,212,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
