Installing LAV Filters may help. Google is your best friend.\n\nIf you want to read more about the codec, check this out:\n                                                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis new technique is not something you can compare with x264 releases.\nDon't let the filesize fool or scare you. \nSmall sized files in this format, doesn't mean LOW QUALITIES. \nThis is the best you can get in this size.\n\nWe'll let you decide for yourself.
