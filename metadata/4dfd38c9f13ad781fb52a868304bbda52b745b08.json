Australia - Season 7, Episode 7\n\n\n\n\nGreig Pickhaver\n\nIconic entertainer Greig Pickhaver, known for his comedic alter ego HG Nelson, investigates the leading characters in his family history. His search uncovers a great-grandfather, Samuel Rinder, who in the late 19th century, made his fortune as a sheep trader in Bendigo. As a wealthy man Rinder spent much of his time and money at the racetrack, but as the economic recession loomed he resorted to fraud and became a wanted man. Greig also investigates a family secret that's much closer to home. His childhood was dominated by his parents' troubled marriage and a mother devoid of affection. For the first time, Greig investigates the events which shaped his mother's life -- discovering a woman he never knew.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 15-Sep-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dfd38c9f13ad781fb52a868304bbda52b745b08","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.AU.S07E07.Greig.Pickhaver.HDTV.x264-Sam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dfd38c9f13ad781fb52a868304bbda52b745b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,253,56,201,241,58,215,129,251,82,168,104,48,75,189,165,43,116,91,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
