YEARS\nLabel:Liberty\nCD Released: 1989\nFormat:Mp3@320\n\nDr. Feelgood are a British pub rock band, formed in 1971. The classic line-up included Lee Brilleaux (b. 1953, d. 7 April 1994; vocals/harmonica), Wilko Johnson (b. John Wilkinson, 1947; guitar), John B. Sparks (b. 1953; bass) and John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Big FigureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Martin (drums). \n\nInitially based in Canvey Island, Essex, on the Thames estuary, Dr. Feelgood broke into the London circuit in 1974. BrilleauxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s menacing personality complemented JohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s propulsive, jerky stage manner, while the guitaristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s staccato style dominated the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s idiosyncratic brand of angular rhythm and blues. \n\nTheir debut album, Down By The Jetty, was released in 1974, but despite critical approbation, it was not until the following year that the quartet secured due commercial success with Stupidity. Recorded live in concert, this raw, compulsive set topped the UK charts and the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s status seemed assured. However, internal friction led to JohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s departure during sessions for a projected fourth album and although his replacement, John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GypieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Mayo, was an accomplished guitarist, he lacked the striking visual image of his predecessor. Dr. Feelgood then embarked on a more mainstream direction which was only intermittently successful. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Milk And AlcoholÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (1978 ) gave them their sole UK Top 10 hit. After the punk explosion their raw, jerky sound and clean-cut image provided inspiration to the post-punk generation (John Lydon being a big fan).\n\nMayo left the band in 1981. Despite this, and various subsequent line-up changes, Dr. Feelgood continued touring and recording, although the band then suffered an almost career-finishing blow, when their frontman, Brilleaux, died of cancer on 7 April 1994. But, as Brilleaux had insisted prior to his demise, Dr. Feelgood reunited, initially with vocalist Pete Gage, and recommenced touring in 1996. Gage was replaced by Robert Kane who, celebrated his 1000th gig as the frontman of Dr. Feelgood in April 2007.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Roxette\n02. She Does It Right\n03. Back In The Night\n04.
