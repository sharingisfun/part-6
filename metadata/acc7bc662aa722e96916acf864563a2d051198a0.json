She strikes a perfect balance between emotional encouragement and practical advice: Hating your job intensely, she writes, is not a business plan. What's here is: the nitty-gritty of getting a business off the ground, legal considerations, making the best use of social networking sites, the components of a business model, organized creative brainstorming, financial advice, shopping for self-paid insurance and benefits, and helpful anecdotes of real-life entrepreneurship. With her humorous insights into corporate life and an appealing no-nonsense yet empathic tone, Slim deals swiftly and incisively with anxiety, fear and hesitation. Readers will cheer as she teaches the tricks behind finding what makes you purrÃ¢â‚¬â€what people will pay you to do, what you have a great passion for and what you are genetically encoded to do. This is a standout in the start-your-own business genre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc7bc662aa722e96916acf864563a2d051198a0","amp;dn":"Escape+from+Cubicle+Nation+From+Corporate+Prisoner+to+Thriving+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc7bc662aa722e96916acf864563a2d051198a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,199,188,102,42,167,34,233,105,22,172,248,100,86,58,45,5,17,152,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
