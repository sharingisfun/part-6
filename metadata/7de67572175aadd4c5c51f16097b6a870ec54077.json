The core combo features Pastorius on some really incredible bass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that re-worked approach to the electric instrument in jazz that went onto inform many generations of players Ã¢â‚¬â€œ matched with the core energy of Randy Brecker on trumpet, Bob Mintzer on tenor and soprano sax, Peter Erskine on drums, Don Alias on percussion, and the surprising addition of Othello Moineaux on steel drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which makes for some very interesting moments. Toots Theielmans joins the sextet at one point Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the larger group features Jon Faddis on trumpet, Wayne Andre on trombone, and Mari Cruz on tenor and soprano sax. \nTitles include &quot;Reza&quot;, &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, &quot;Twins&quot;, &quot;Eleven&quot;, &quot;Okonkole Y Trompa&quot;, and &quot;Amerika&quot;.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Amerika\n02 - Okonkole Y Trompa\n03 - Reza - Giant Steps - Reza (reprizse)\n04 - Elegant People\n05 - Twins\n06 - Pac-man Blues (Fannie Mae)\n07 - Eleven\n\n*2013 Warner Japan / Rhino | WPCR-27457 | Jazz Best Collection 1000 Series\n {2013 Japan 24-bit Remaster}\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJaco Pastorius - bass\nDon Alias - percussion\nRandy Brecker - trumpet\nPeter Erskine - drums\nBobby Mintzer - tenor and soprano saxophone, bass clarinet\nOthello Molineaux - steel drums\n\n\n\n\nJaco Pastorius Big Band - Twins I (1982) [EAC-FLAC] :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10262762/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_I_(1982)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10262762/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_I_(1982)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
