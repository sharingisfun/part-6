Images were scanned at 150 dpi and saved in .gif form. They can be reprinted without quality loss at 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;. Good for teachers who are doing animal-themed units or for parents on a rainy day. Note: Unlike in the &quot;Cool Creatures&quot; and &quot;Awesome Animals&quot; coloring books, a number of the animals in this version were drawn so large that they spanned both coloring-book pages. They were scanned as separate images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7bc051dfa666473db89b9e2fdee907fc415d9ee","amp;dn":"Coloring+Book+-+Planet+Earth+-+Wildlife+Wonders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7bc051dfa666473db89b9e2fdee907fc415d9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,188,5,29,250,102,100,115,219,137,185,226,253,238,144,127,196,21,217,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
