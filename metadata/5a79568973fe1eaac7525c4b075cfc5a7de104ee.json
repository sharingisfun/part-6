The two bind themselves to one another, becoming intimate friends \nand agreeing &quot;there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places \ndo seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty \nfree and easy and comfortable on a raft.&quot; \n\nAs Huck learns about love, responsibility, and morality, the trip \nbecomes a metaphoric voyage through his own soul, culminating in the \nglorious moment when he decides to &quot;go to hell&quot; rather than return Jim \nto slavery. \n\nMark Twain defined classic as &quot;a book which people praise and don't \nread&quot;; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a happy exception to his \nown rule. Twain's mastery of dialect, coupled with his famous wit, has \nmade Huckleberry Finn one of the most loved and distinctly American \nclassics ever written.\n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published \nin England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. \nCommonly recognized as one of the Great American Novels, the work is \namong the first in major American literature to be written in the \nvernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the \nfirst person by Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer.\n\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places \nalong the Mississippi River. Satirizing a Southern antebellum society \nthat was already out of date by the time the work was published, \nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing look at entrenched \nattitudes, particularly racism.\n\nThe work has been popular with readers since its publication and is \ntaken as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It has also been the \ncontinued object of study by serious literary critics. It was criticized \nupon release because of its coarse language and became even more \ncontroversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial \nstereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a79568973fe1eaac7525c4b075cfc5a7de104ee","amp;dn":"HUCKLEBERRY+FINN+-+Mark+Twain.+Read+by+William+Dufris+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a79568973fe1eaac7525c4b075cfc5a7de104ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,121,86,137,115,254,30,170,199,82,92,75,7,92,252,90,125,225,4,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
