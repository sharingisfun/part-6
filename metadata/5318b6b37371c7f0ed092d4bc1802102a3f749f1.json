This second edition of a comprehensive reference in glass science, points out the correlation between the performance of industrial processes and practice-relevant properties, such as strength and optical properties. Interdisciplinary in his approach, the author discusses both the science and technology, starting with an outline of history and applications, glass structure, and rheology.\r\nThe sections on properties include mechanical strength and contact resistance, ageing, mechanics of glass processes, the production and control of residual stresses, high-tech products, and current research and development. Applications include glazing, packaging, optical glass, glass fibers for reinforcement, and abrasive tools. The development of touchscreen technology showed how important were the design and resistance of thin flexible glass and these new thin aluminosilicate glasses are also discussed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5318b6b37371c7f0ed092d4bc1802102a3f749f1","amp;dn":"Glass+-+Mechanics+and+Technology+2nd+ed+-+Eric+Le+Bourhis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5318b6b37371c7f0ed092d4bc1802102a3f749f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,24,182,179,115,113,199,240,237,9,45,75,193,128,33,2,163,247,73,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
