It starred Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden as two spirited residents of a retirement home who spend their time running rings around the home's oppressive management and their own families. It was written by Michael Aitkens.\n\nThe programme is still repeated in the UK on various channels. Seasons 1 through 5 have run (and in some cases continue to run) on PBS in the United States, and in New Zealand the show has aired various times since 2002.\n\nDiana Trent (Stephanie Cole) - Diana is a curmudgeonly old woman who is constantly complaining about the state of the world. She is an atheist and often irritates Tom, who does believe in God. Trent used to be a photojournalist, specialising in combat zones.\n\nTom Ballard (Graham Crowden) - Tom is an optimistic, jolly old man who is new to the home. He suffers from mild dementia but he always tries to make the best of things. It is possible that his life prior to retirement was boring for Tom; to make up for this shortcoming he frequently takes imaginary trips to other places (mentally checking out of the retirement home). Sometimes, however, he goes against certain people such as Harvey Bains, who he often campaigns against and insults. He is visited often by his 'dull' son Geoffrey and Geoffrey's annoying, offensive wife Marion.\n\nJane Edwards (Janine Duvitski) - Jane is Harvey's prudish, homely and devout assistant who always looks on the bright side of life and is thinking up new ideas, which are often backed up by Tom. She secretly fancies and admires Harvey, whom she often touches on the shoulder, to which Harvey replies disgustedly, 'Jane...you're touching me' and she says 'Sorry, Harvey!' She is often shocked by what Diana says and then exclaims 'Oh Diana!!'\n\nHarvey Bains (Daniel Hill) - The greedy, vain manager of the care home who secretly wishes to get rid of all of the residents. He tries to reduce expenses (saying that the &quot;oldies&quot; aren't &quot;efficient units&quot;) and keep on top of things but is constantly distracted by Jane, Diana, Tom, Marion and Geoffrey. His life is always made difficult by the residents, or 'inmates'. His father, whom he never knew, was an American gangster.\n\nOther cast\nGeoffrey Ballard, played by Andrew Tourell\nMarion Ballard, played by Sandra Payne\nBasil Makepeace, played by Michael Bilton\nAntonio, the Portuguese gardener, played by Chico Andrade\nJenny, played by Dawn Hope","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26cd86e8e1c94ecdddec5fd66c315e746575ccd","amp;dn":"BBC+Comedy+-+Waiting+for+God+-+Complete+%28x.264%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26cd86e8e1c94ecdddec5fd66c315e746575ccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,108,216,110,142,28,148,236,221,222,197,253,102,195,21,231,70,87,92,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
