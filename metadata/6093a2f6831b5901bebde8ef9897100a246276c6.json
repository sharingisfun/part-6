The use of light and shadow is spectacular, the music is divine, and the camera is constantly seeking and finding beauty in every shot.\n\nLooking at the postings so far it seems everyone has a different explanation, so I might as well throw mine into the mix. To me Veronique/Weronika are twin angels being manipulated (guided might be a better choice of word) by God (or an abstract Divine) for some unfathomable purpose. Consider the use of the puppeteer as a metaphor for the condition, look at how he says he makes two because they are fragile and break easily (just as Weronika breaks in her concert). Veronique speaks of how she always knows what to do in every situation as if her life is leading up to something. Theres a telling scene about midway through the film where Veronique walks between shadows through a slender path of light her face gazing rapturously at the the sun. Both V\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s appreciate and reflect the beauty around them: light, shadows, the falling rain, ... highly reminiscent to me of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;fallen\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; angels in Wings of Desire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6093a2f6831b5901bebde8ef9897100a246276c6","amp;dn":"The+Double+Life+of+Veronique+%28K.+Kieslowski%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6093a2f6831b5901bebde8ef9897100a246276c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,147,162,246,131,27,89,1,190,189,232,239,152,151,16,10,36,98,118,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
