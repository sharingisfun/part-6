In order to restore land communication with Leningrad the Soviet command was preparing an operation &quot;Spark&quot;. Scheduling of operations and the breakthrough would have been impossible without the active work of the division and regimental artillery and aerial reconnaissance. It became one of the scouts missions to break the blockade. Everyone could not become a scout. Volunteer training lasted from weeks to months, and only after that they went on a mission. To oversee the defense of the enemy, the forefront of infantry units were equipped with a network of observation points, where scouts watched the terrain shifts, recording every detail. Before the advent of reconnaissance mission came the order to get information on the German defenses in the hallway on a plot of 12 km, called &quot;bottle neck&quot;. A job in the usual form, without insignia, documents and awards went three groups of scouts - reconnaissance, capture and cover. With a sample only necessary weapons - a knife, PCA or MR-40. In the night of January 12, using survey data, consolidated group of night bombers from Volkhov Front bombed artillery positions and control points of the enemy breakthrough band. Between Leningrad and the &quot;main land&quot; a narrow corridor formed through which the city has become possible to deliver food and fuel. Special story - about SMGs designer Alexei Sudaeva, and a separate chapter is devoted to a series of award - the countries highest medal &quot;For Valour&quot;.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1839/jivhq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1839/jivhq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8523/4s9x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8523/4s9x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9394/co4l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9394/co4l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2393/m8ab.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2393/m8ab.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9059/ehsn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9059/ehsn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1809/roz6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1809/roz6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5374/iv2d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5374/iv2d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/7017/e7oa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/7017/e7oa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6025/r2uc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6025/r2uc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6360/n9qpk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6360/n9qpk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8382/z9vz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8382/z9vz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3564/jrbt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3564/jrbt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1872/lmih.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1872/lmih.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3690/fjio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3690/fjio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/815/zpwj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/815/zpwj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/2597/f1oc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/2597/f1oc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2045 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.875:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:23.400\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 705 MB / average\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Liberators:_The_Soldiers_of_the_Red_Army&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Liberators:_The_Soldiers_of_the_Red_Army&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6692da64f88289a640196bac330ee889da5ddd8b","amp;dn":"TV+Rossiya+Liberators+The+Soldiers+of+the+Red+Army+05of12+The+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6692da64f88289a640196bac330ee889da5ddd8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,146,218,100,248,130,137,166,64,25,107,172,51,14,232,137,218,93,221,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
