From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that devastated waterfront communities, reshaped manufacturing, destroyed centuries-old ports, and created massive new ports where there were none before. The Box tells the dramatic story of how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur, Malcom McLean, turned containerization from an impractical idea into a phenomenon that slashed transportation costs and made the boom in global trade possible.\n\nMarc Levinson is an economist in New York and author of three previous books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f17195023b50555ff797add5774d2e634254124","amp;dn":"The+Box+By+Marc+Levinson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f17195023b50555ff797add5774d2e634254124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,23,25,80,35,181,5,85,255,121,122,221,87,116,210,230,52,37,65,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
