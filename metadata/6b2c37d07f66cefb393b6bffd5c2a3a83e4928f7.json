In the Ninth Edition, College Algebra has evolved to meet todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s course needs, building on these hallmarks by integrating projects and other interactive learning tools for use in the classroom or online.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMichael Sullivan, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Chicago State University, received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
