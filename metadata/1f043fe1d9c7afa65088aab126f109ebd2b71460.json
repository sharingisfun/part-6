The collection is spread across two discs, encompassing the years of their greatest commercial success.  The songs are presented chronologically, and the performances also hew to the material released near the time of recordings: tracks from 1983 such as &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot; are culled from 1983 concerts and sound very similar to their studio-recorded versions despite the availability of later performances in which the songs are performed in an acoustic style or with a rock band.  A limited three-disc version provides the exception. The third disc contains six songs drawn from a short acoustic set performed during the Revival Tour from 1989. Songs such as 1983's &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot; and &quot;Right By Your Side&quot; are included along with more recent fare, &quot;You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart&quot;.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Never Gonna Cry Again\n[02] Love Is A Stranger\n[03] Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\n[04] This City Never Sleeps\n[05] Somebody Told Me\n[06] Who's That Girl\n[07] Right By Your Side\n[08] Here Comes The Rain Again\n[09] Sex Crime (1984)\n[10] I Love You Like A Ball And Chain\n[11] Would I Lie To You\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:49m:11s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)\n[02] Thorn In My Side\n[03] Let's Go\n[04] Missionary Man\n[05] The Last Time\n[06] Miracle Of Love\n[07] I Need a Man\n[08] We Two Are One\n[09] (My My) Baby's Gonna Cry\n[10] Don't Ask Me Why\n[11] Angel\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:57m:21s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:46m:32s\nTotal File Size....................... 251mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
