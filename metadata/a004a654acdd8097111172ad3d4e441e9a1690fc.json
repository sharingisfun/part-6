Pretty heady company! Allingham has, for the most part, a lighter style than the others. Her hero, Campion has much in common with Lord Peter, but he lacks Wimsey's total perfection and flaunts his heritage (and education) a bit less. Initially cast as a 'zany', he has a great deal of fun in him. In later novels he will gradually mature into a genuinely remarkable character - [Marc Ruby]\n\n#1. The Crime At Black Dudley [7 hours 16 mins] 1929\nThe gaiety of a weekend party in rural Suffolk is shattered when the host's uncle is murdered and a document is taken from the body. The house guests are held hostage until the paper is found. Dr George Abbershaw uncovers the killer, but even he is nonplussed by the mysterious young man - friend or enemy? - who calls himself Albert Campion. 'The Crime at Black Dudley' is not Allingham's best, but it foreshadows many of the novels to come. In her early work Allingham has a bright and distinctive approach to the problems and pleasures of the young men and women of post-war Britain. This gave her a tremendous and well deserved readership that grew up along with her and her erratic hero. She is still wonderful entertainment! (MR)\n\n#2.
