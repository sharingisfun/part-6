From the quiet city of Lancaster, PA, the three members of the Innocence Mission made their music, all of it exalting love and friendship, peace and joy. Here, group founders and songwriters Don Peris (guitar/vocals) and Karen Peris (vocals/guitar/piano), along with Mike Bitts (bass), handcrafted their fourth album, Birds of My Neighborhood. Peris was also featured on Natalie Merchant's album Ophelia, adding her mystical voice on a few tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205c60ad4098cc26efb8cb1ef214de31d6f587a2","amp;dn":"The+Innocence+Mission+-+Birds+of+My+Neighborhood+%5B1999%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205c60ad4098cc26efb8cb1ef214de31d6f587a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,92,96,173,64,152,204,38,239,184,203,30,242,20,222,49,214,245,135,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
