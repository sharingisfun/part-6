The piece consists of a single six-part suite performed by an eleven-piece band. An intensely emotional work, it displays Mingus&amp;#039; skill as composer, orchestrator, and technician.\n\nWritten as a ballet, the work borrows from Ellingtonian and Latin sources, but creates a unique orchestral style that Mingus called &quot;ethnic folk-dance music&quot;. The orchestrations (described as &quot;one of the greatest achievements [...] by any composer in jazz history&quot; by the All Music Guide) are rich and multi-layered. Mingus&amp;#039; perfectionism led to extensive use of studio overdubbing techniques, the first for a jazz album.The track A features the virtuoso Don Butterfield (Normaly a tuba performer) playing a contrabass trombone\n\nThe album liner notes were provided by Mingus&amp;#039; psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock.\n\nTrack listing:\n--------------\n\n   1. &quot;Track A - Solo Dancer&quot; -6:20\n      &quot;Stop!
