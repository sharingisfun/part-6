While other programs limit you to two players with a Cross-Fader, Virtual DJ Studio provides you with an entire studio.\r\n\r\nExclusive app-based control and customer song requests make Virtual DJ Studio stand out above the rest! Click here for more details about this exclusive feature.\r\n\r\nVirtual DJ Studio gives you a mixer-board interface. Each line offers things you would expect from a typical mixer -- volume fader, mute, crossfader assignment, etc. Additionally, each line contains an MP3/WAV/Karaoke player, with all of the controls you might expect -- including a Pitch/Tempo control. If you have two or more sound cards/audio devices, you can route any line to your secondary device, for headphone preview or beat-matching. Alternatively, you might use this feature to simply allow more control with your external mixer.\r\n\r\nPlaylist Support\r\nYou can load up a playlist full of music, set the Auto-Crossfade button, and simply let VDJ mix your music.\r\n\r\nFull Karaoke Support\r\nThe days of hunting down a Karaoke CD, finding the right track, and having only one or two singers queue'd up are gone! With a Laptop, you can replace not only your CD players; you can eliminate the need for cases of CDs, and take up less space than you ever imagined!\r\n\r\nSupported Karaoke Formats\r\nYou can either play an MP3 that has a corresponding .CDG file, or you can play directly from a ZIP file. VDJ does this directly, with no need to create temporary files (like most other programs do). VDJ is the only Karaoke system that lets you seek while directly playing a ZIP or MP3 file, without ever losing sync!\r\n\r\nNo other Karaoke package delivers this many features.\r\nSingers List\r\nEven though VDJ looks different from other Karaoke programs, it still contains a Singer's List feature. When enabled, you can queue up any number of songs, along with the name of the person who wishes to sing it. From there, you can drag a song into a line in VDJ, or simply double-click to launch the file in the first line. VDJ will also display a list of singers/songs in the CDG window when no karaoke file is being played (for example, if your CDG window is connected to a second monitor, television, or multiple TVs, your patrons will know who's up next, and when their song will be up).\r\n\r\nEasy to Use\r\nDon't be intimidated by the number of buttons you see in the picture. If you have a knack for audio equipment, you will quickly pick up on VDJs use. VDJ comes with a complete Help file, including a Getting Started guide that will have you mixing MP3s in no time!\r\n\r\nHeadphone Support\r\nVDJ allows you to use an extra sound card for CUEing, or Previewing, a sound file. You can use this feature to assist with beat-mixing (fading two songs together on-beat), or for simply previewing a song before playing it live. Many DJs use their laptop's built-in sound for previewing (since the quality of the internal sound chip is often lacking), and an external USB audio device for their main mix. This configuration allows you the flexibility you are used to with dual CD decks and an external mixer; just like a real mixer, enabling the CUE button routes that line to the headphone output (eg, to your Secondary Sound Card).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 7.2.4\r\nReleased: September 29th, 2015\r\n\r\nWe have fixed a few very minor bugs, and added one new feature: You can now select certain folders that will automatically reindex every time you start VDJ.\r\n\r\nThis is handy for a Downloads or New Songs folder, so that you don't have to reindex your entire library when you add new songs.\r\n\r\nSee the Options dialog from the Search window for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements: WIN ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INSTALLATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Unrar\r\n\r\n2) Install\r\n\r\n3) copy cracked .exe to installation dir.\r\n\r\n4) double-click on the .reg file.\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Thats it!
