Records. It is Seal's second compilation album following 2004's Best 1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004. The album was released on two formats, a 1-disc standard edition which featured 19 tracks and a 2-disc deluxe edition which featured 34 tracks. Both versions of the album included two new songs &quot;I Am Your Man&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;.  The cover also serves as the artwork for the 2008 single &quot;It's a Man's Man's Man's World&quot;.  The single disc edition tends to include many of the single versions of the songs, whereas the deluxe edition replaces them with the album versions, or as in &quot;The Beginning&quot;'s case, a remix.\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] I Am Your Man\n[02] Kiss From A Rose\n[03] Crazy\n[04] Fly Like An Eagle\n[05] Love's Divine\n[06] A Change Is Gonna Come\n[07] Amazing\n[08] Get It Together\n[09] My Vision\n[10] Prayer For The Dying\n[11] I Can't Stand The Rain\n[12] Waiting For You\n[13] The Beginning\n[14] The Right Life\n[15] Don't Cry\n[16] Rolling\n[17] If You Don't Know Me By Now\n[18] Violet\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:19m:09s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Killer\n[02] Future Love Paradise\n[03] Human Beings\n[04] A Father's Way\n[05] I'm Alive\n[06] Colour\n[07] Free\n[08] Latest Craze\n[09] System\n[10] Newborn Friend\n[11] Lips Like Sugar - - - Seal Featuring Mikey Dread\n[12] This Could Be Heaven\n[13] Les Mots - - - Seal Duet With MylÃƒÂ¨ne Farmer\n[14] It's A Man's Man's Man's World\n[15] Soul Medley Live (Get It Together - Here I Am - Knock On Wood)\n[16] Thank You\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:16m:40s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 02h:35m:49s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.02GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
