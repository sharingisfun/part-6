As a successful surgeon until she lost a patient and her license three years ago, Watson views her current job as another opportunity to help people, as well as paying a penance. However, the restless Sherlock is nothing like her previous clients. He informs her that none of her expertise as an addiction specialist applies to him and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devised his own post-rehab regimen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ resuming his work as a police consultant in New York City. Watson has no choice but to accompany her irascible new charge on his jobs. But, Sherlock finds her medical background helpful, and Watson realizes she has a knack for playing investigator. SherlockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s police contact, Captain Thomas Gregson, knows from previous experience working with Scotland Yard that Sherlock is brilliant at closing cases, and welcomes him as part of the team, which includes Detective Marcus Bell. Bell is an investigator with sharp intuition and formidable interrogation skills. Although initially skeptical of Holmes and his unorthodox methods, Bell begins to recognize Sherlock as an asset in their investigations. With the mischievous Sherlock Holmes now running free in New York solving crime, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple deduction that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to need someone to keep him grounded, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elementary that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a job for Watson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3862ec69dff8d7e636c28b3d829b45297f57f356","amp;dn":"Elementary+Season+2+episode+1+-+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3862ec69dff8d7e636c28b3d829b45297f57f356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,98,236,105,223,248,215,230,54,194,139,61,130,155,69,41,127,87,243,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
