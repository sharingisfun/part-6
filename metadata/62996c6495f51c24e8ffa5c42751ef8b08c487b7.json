But the closer they get, the less Mary is willing to trust a woman who by her own admission will do anything to finish the DeceiverÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means killing Michael and Mary to try again in another life. As they face their final battle, Michael's loyalties are tested, making him vulnerable just when Mary needs him most.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62996c6495f51c24e8ffa5c42751ef8b08c487b7","amp;dn":"Falling+Light+by+Thea+Harrison+%28ePUB%29+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62996c6495f51c24e8ffa5c42751ef8b08c487b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,153,108,100,149,245,28,36,232,255,165,196,39,81,239,139,8,196,135,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
