The last two decades were dominated by revelations of wide-spread abuses committed by the clergy in USA, Africa, Ireland, India and Australia. Now the news are dominated by similar abuses committed in Brazil, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, the Netherland and other European countries.\n\nGermany's sex abuse scandal has now reached Pope Benedict XVI: His former archdiocese disclosed that while he was archbishop a suspected pedophile priest was transferred to a job where he later abused children. The pontiff is also under increasing fire for a 2001 Vatican document he later penned instructing bishops to keep such cases secret. The revelations may lead to further questions about what the pontiff knew about the scope of abuse in his native Germany, when he knew it and what he did about it during his archbishop tenure in Munich.\n\nAlso, the news this week is dominated by the letter of the Pope to the people of Ireland apologizing for the sex abuses against them. He expressed his &quot;shame and remorse&quot; for the &quot;sinful and criminal acts&quot; suffered by the Irish victims. The letter, however, lacked any accountability and what actions are to be taken against the complicit bishops. The Pope's letter is included in this UL.  Included also in separate subdirectories are the official reports about the sexual child abuse in Ireland.\n\n\nThis upload contains 10 titles in the main directory:\n\n1- Galasso ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Crosses: Portraits of Clergy Abuse (2007).
