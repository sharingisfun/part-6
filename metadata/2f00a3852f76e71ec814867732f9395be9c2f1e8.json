But now it's summer break and she has nowhere else to go but home. \n\nElla fears everything she worked so hard to bury might resurface, especially with Micha living right next door. If Micha tries to tempt the old her back, she knows that it will be hard to resist.\n\nMicha is sexy, smart, confident, and can get under EllaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skin like no one else can. He knows everything about her, including her darkest secrets.

But with her father in and out of rehab, she's having a hard time making it through the days. All she wants is Micha by her side, but she refuses to let her problems get in the way of his dreams.\n\nMicha spends his days touring the country with his band, but deep down he knows something is missing. Being away from Ella is harder than he thought it would be. He wants her closer to him-needs her with him. But he won't ask her to leave college, just to be with him.\n\nThe few moments they do spend together are intense and passionate, but it only makes it more difficult when they have to part.
