One of the band's most famous songs is &quot;Gott sein&quot; (&quot;To be God&quot;) on their first full album Wer Bist Du? (&quot;Who Are You?&quot;). Megaherz has gone through many changes in musical style since their founding. Their early works are a fairly dark alternative metal, comparable to 1990s American bands such as Faith No More, whereas recent works are comparable to bands such as Oomph! and Rammstein. Their early albums all include at least one song based on a classic German fairy tale, including &quot;Rapunzel&quot; on Kopfschuss, &quot;Windkind&quot; (&quot;Wind child&quot;) on Himmelfahrt and &quot;I.M Rumpelstilzchen&quot; on Herzwerk II.\n\nDiscography Part 2 - ID3 Tagged - Album Art Included\n1995 - Herzwerk (Not On Label) (RE 2002) 320kbps\n1997 - Gott Sein (CD Single) 320kbps\n1998 - LiebestÃƒÂ¶ter (CD Single) 320kbps\n1998 - Rock Me Amadeus (CD Single) 256kbps\n1999 - Frieflung (CD Single) 320kbps\n2008 - Heuchler (Studio Album) 320kbps\n2010 - Loblieder (Remix Album) 320kbps\n2011 - Jagzeit (CD Single) 320kbps\n2012 - Gotterdammerung (Studio Album) 320kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f731e6994473680625fb74bdb0de203e275c47","amp;dn":"Megaherz+Discography+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f731e6994473680625fb74bdb0de203e275c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,247,49,230,153,68,115,104,6,37,251,116,189,176,222,32,62,39,92,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
