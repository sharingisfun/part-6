It draws on research on the biological foundations of personality and trait-based research including investigations of neural mechanisms in defensive information processing as well as brain systems critical to self-concept. The text introduces questions of personality-and-brain along with biological foundations. It explores each of various theoretical issues at a new level of investigation, that of brain research to provide a more up-to-date look at the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2248a6c0ec5fded799760855e374ce1bbaf38e75","amp;dn":"Personality%3A+Theory+and+Research%2C+12E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D+%28Working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2248a6c0ec5fded799760855e374ce1bbaf38e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,72,166,192,236,95,222,215,153,118,8,85,227,116,206,27,186,243,142,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
