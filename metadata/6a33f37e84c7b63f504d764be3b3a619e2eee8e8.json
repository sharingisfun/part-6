The music is best described as alternative rock, with heavy druggy blues leanings and obvious influences from the seventies; Black Sabbath, Velvet Underground, Rolling Stones, Blue Cheer, Led Zeppelin, Can, Pink Floyd etc. \n\n\nAfter founding Jerk With a Bomb in the late '90s, Stephen McBean had by the mid-2000s transformed the Vancouver-area band into a group called Black Mountain. Drawing on blues, psychedelia, acid rock, and the Velvet Underground, Black Mountain's sound was a cross between the darkness and grit of the Warlocks and Brian Jonestown Massacre's trippiness. After debuting in October 2004 on Jagjaguwar with the 12&quot; Druganaut, Black Mountain stayed with the label for an eponymous full-length, issued the following January. Joining McBean for the album were local players Matthew Camirand, Jeremy Schmidt, Joshua Wells, and Amber Wells, listed collectively to preserve the band's communal ethic. (Black Mountain ran concurrent to and intermingled with McBean's other band, lo-fi classic rockers Pink Mountaintops.) ~ Johnny Loftus, All Music Guide\n\n\n224Vbr\nCover included\n\n\n1.
