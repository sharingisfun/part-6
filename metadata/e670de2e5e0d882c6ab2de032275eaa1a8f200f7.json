Powerful, at times surreal, stories of loneliness, obsession, and eroticism, these novellas bear all the hallmarks of Murakami's later books, giving us a fascinating insight into a great writer's beginnings, and are remarkable works of fiction in their own right. Here too is an exclusive essay by Murakami in which he explores and explains his decision to become a writer. Prequels to the much-beloved classics A Wild Sheep Chase and Dance Dance Dance, these early works are essential reading for Murakami completists and contemporary fiction lovers alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e670de2e5e0d882c6ab2de032275eaa1a8f200f7","amp;dn":"Haruki+Murakami+-+Wind%2FPinball+%28The+Rat+%231-2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e670de2e5e0d882c6ab2de032275eaa1a8f200f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,112,222,46,94,13,136,44,106,178,222,3,34,117,234,161,168,242,0,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
