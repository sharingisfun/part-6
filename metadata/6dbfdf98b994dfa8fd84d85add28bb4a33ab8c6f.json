McKennitt is known for her refined, warbling soprano vocals.\n\n\nMcKennitt was born in Morden, Manitoba of Irish and Scottish descent to parents Jack and Irene McKennitt (a livestock dealer and a nurse). She moved to Stratford, Ontario in 1981, where she lives.\n\nWhen Loreena was young she wanted to become a veterinarian but she found that music chose her rather than she it.[3] Developing a passion for Celtic music, she learned to play the Celtic harp and began busking at various places, one well known place being St. Lawrence Market in Toronto in order to earn money needed for publishing her first album.\n\nHer first album, Elemental, was released in 1985, followed by To Drive the Cold Winter Away (1987), Parallel Dreams (1989), The Visit (1991), The Mask and Mirror (1994), A Winter Garden (1995), The Book of Secrets (1997), An Ancient Muse (2006) and A Midwinter NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream (2008). All of her work is released under her own label, Quinlan Road.\n\nIn 1993, her music became known to a wider audience when she toured Europe supporting Mike Oldfield. In 1995, her version of the traditional Irish song &quot;Bonny Portmore&quot; was prominently featured in the film Highlander 3, causing a large increase of album sales among fans of the films. McKennitt's single &quot;The Mummers' Dance&quot; was a widespread success, receiving considerable airplay in North American markets during the spring of 1997, and was used as the theme song for the short-lived TV series, Legacy.\n\nHer music appeared in the movies The Santa Clause, Soldier, Jade, Holy Man, The Mists of Avalon, Tinkerbell, and in the television series Roar and Due South.\n\nIn 1998, McKennitt's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Ronald Rees; his brother Richard; and their close friend Gregory Cook, drowned during a boating incident on Georgian Bay. She was deeply affected by the event and subsequently founded the Cook-Rees Memorial Fund for Water Search and Safety in the same year.\n\nAt the time of the incident, she was working on an album of two live performances called Live in Paris and Toronto. The proceeds from the sales of that album were donated to the newly created fund, totaling some three million dollars. [5] After the release of the live album, McKennitt decided to substantially reduce the number of public performances and did not release any new recordings until the studio album An Ancient Muse in 2006.\n\nMcKennitt's music has generally been classified as World / Celtic music even though it contains aspects and characteristics of music from around the globe and is sometimes classified as Folk music in record stores.\n\nBefore McKennitt composes any music, she engages in considerable research on a specific subject which then forms the general concept of the album. Before creating Elemental and Parallel Dreams, she traveled to Ireland for inspiration from the country's history, folklore, geography and culture. The album The Mask and Mirror was preceded by research in Spain where she engaged in studying Galicia, a Celtic section of Spain, along with its abundant Arabic roots. The result was an album including elements of Celtic and Arabic music. According to the notes of her latest album, An Ancient Muse was inspired primarily by travels among and reading about the various cultures along the Silk Road.\n\nMcKennitt is compared to Enya, but McKennitt's music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; by Lord Tennyson, &quot;Prospero's Speech&quot; (the final soliloquy in William Shakespeare's The Tempest), &quot;Snow&quot; by Archibald Lampman, &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; by St. John of the Cross, William Blake's &quot;Lullaby&quot;, Yeats' &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;, and &quot;The Highwayman&quot; by Alfred Noyes.\n\nIn 2005, McKennitt was involved in an acrimonious court case in England when her former friend and employee, Niema Ash, published a book which contained intimate details of their friendship. McKennitt argued that much of the book contained confidential personal information, which Ash had no right to publish. The English courts found that there had indeed been a breach of confidence and a misuse of McKennitt's private information, and the case is likely to set important precedents in English law on the privacy of celebrities.[6] The House of Lords affirmed the lower court's decisions in 2007.\n\n\nIn September 2006, McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The performance premiered on PBS and in August 2007 was released on a three-disc DVD/CD set entitled Nights from the Alhambra.\n\nIn 2008, McKennitt composed the song entitled To The Fairies They Draw Near as the theme song for Disney's direct to video animated film Tinker Bell. The film makers were so impressed with her, that they asked her to do the narration for the film.[8]\n\nIn the Spring of that same year, she returned to Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios to record A Midwinter NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream, an extended version of A Winter Garden (1995). The album was released on October 28.[9]\n\nSince the release of An Ancient Muse Loreena has toured consistently, with a European and North American tour in the Spring of 2007, an extensive cross Canada and United States tour in the fall of 2007, a summer tour of Europe in 2008 and a Mediterranean tour in the summer of 2009, with stops in Greece (concerts were postponed, but finally held in late June)[10], Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Hungary and Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElemental 1985 (remastered 2005)\n\n\nElemental is the first album recorded by Loreena McKennitt and vehicle with which she launched the Quinlan Road label. It was released in 1985. The album was recorded one week in July, 1985. The studio was in a barn in southern Ontario and situated in a field of sunflowers.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Blacksmith&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n2.\t&quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n3.\t&quot;Stolen Child&quot; (William Butler Yeats/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n4.\t&quot;The Lark in the Clear Air&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n5.\t&quot;Carrighfergus&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n6.\t&quot;Kellswater&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n7.\t&quot;Banks of Claudy&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n8.\t&quot;Come by the Hills&quot; (Traditional/Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n9.\t&quot;Lullaby&quot; (William Blake/Loreena McKennit) - 4:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Drive the Cold Winter Away 1987 (remastered 2005)\n\n\n\nTo Drive the Cold Winter Away is Loreena McKennitt's second album, released in 1987. It pays homage to her childhood memories of music for the winter season, the most vivid of which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcame from songs and carols recorded in churches or great halls, rich with their own unique ambience and tradition.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½[1]\n\nTo capture that remembered ambiance, McKennit kept the arrangements sparse, celebrating the beauty of simplicity. She also chose to leave the found sounds of life in the performances, which were recorded on location in churches and great halls:[2]\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Church of Our Lady in Guelph, Ontario, Canada\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tGlenstal Abbey, A Benedictine Monastery near Limerick, Ireland\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAnnaghmakerrig (The Tyrone Guthrie Centre) in County Monaghan, Ireland\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;In Praise of Christmas&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n2.\t&quot;The Seasons&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n3.\t&quot;The King&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n4.\t&quot;Banquet Hall&quot; (Loreena McKennit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n5.\t&quot;Snow&quot; (Loreena McKennit/Archibald Lampman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n6.\t&quot;Balulalow&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n7.\t&quot;Let Us the Infant Greet&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n8.\t&quot;The Wexford Carol&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:07\n9.\t&quot;The Stockford Carol&quot; (Loreena McKennit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n10.\t&quot;Let All That Are to Mirth Inclined&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallel Dreams 1989 (remastered 2005)\n\n\n\nParallel Dreams, released in 1989, is Loreena McKennitt's third album.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Samain Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n2.\t&quot;Moon Cradle&quot; (Loreena McKennitt/Padraic Collum)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n3.\t&quot;Huron 'Beltane' Fire Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n4.\t&quot;Annachie Gordon&quot; (Traditional, arranged by Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:22\n5.\t&quot;Standing Stones&quot; (Traditional lyrics/Music by Loreena McKennitt)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:56\n6.\t&quot;Dickens' Dublin (The Palace)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n7.\t&quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23\n8.\t&quot;Ancient Pines&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Visit 1991\n\n\nThe Visit is the fourth studio album by Loreena McKennitt and was released in 1991.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;All Souls Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n2.\t&quot;Bonny Portmore&quot; (Traditional, arranged and adapted by Loreena McKennit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n3.\t&quot;Between the Shadows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n4.\t&quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; (Lyrics by Alfred Lord Tennyson adapted by Loreena McKennitt, music by Loreena McKennit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:34\n5.\t&quot;Greensleeves&quot; (Traditional music arranged by Loreena McKennitt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n6.\t&quot;Tango to Evora&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n7.\t&quot;Courtyard Lullaby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n8.\t&quot;The Old Ways&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n9.\t&quot;Cymbeline&quot; (Music by Loreena McKennitt, Lyric by William Shakespeare) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mask and Mirror 1994 (remastered 2004)\n\n\nThe Mask and Mirror is an album by Loreena McKennitt released in 1994.\n\n\nLike most of Loreena McKennitt's albums, The Mask and Mirror is heavily influenced by her travels. Her experiences in Spain and Morocco specifically, serve as the inspiration for this album.\n\n&quot;I looked back and forth through the window of 15th century Spain, through the hues of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, and was drawn into a fascinating world: history, religion, cross-cultural fertilization... For some medieval minds the mirror &quot;was the door through which the soul frees itself by passing&quot;... for others the pursuit of personal refinement was likened to &quot;polishing the mirror of the soul.&quot; From the more familiar turf of the west coast of Ireland, through the troubadours of France, crossing over the Pyrenees and then to the west through Galicia, down through Andalusia and past Gibraltar to Morocco... The Crusades, the pilgrimage to Santiago, Cathars, the Knights Templar, the Sufis from Egypt, One Thousand and One Nights in Arabia, the Celtic imagery of trees, the Gnostic Gospels... who was God? and what is religion, what spirituality? What was revealed and what was concealed... and what was the mask and what the mirror?&quot; -- Loreena McKennitt, Introduction to The Mask and Mirror\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Mystic's Dream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:40\n2.\t&quot;The Bonny Swans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:18\n3.\t&quot;The Dark Night of the Soul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:44\n4.\t&quot;Marrakesh Night Market&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:30\n5.\t&quot;Full Circle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57\n6.\t&quot;Santiago&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n7.\t&quot;CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mise le Ulaingt?/The Two Trees&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:06\n8.\t&quot;Prospero's Speech&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Secrets 1997\n\n\n\nThe Book of Secrets is an album by Loreena McKennitt released in 1997.

According to reports on McKennitt's Quinlan Road website, most of the inspiration for the tracks of the album came from the music of Greece, Turkey, the Middle East and the Far East. Most of the tracks, with the exception of three revealed at the mid-September concerts in the Alhambra of Granada in Spain, were completely unknown until the release.\n\nAn Ancient Muse debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 83, with about 19,000 copies sold in its first week.[1] This was also its peak position on the chart\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Incantation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n2.\t&quot;The Gates of Istanbul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:59\n3.\t&quot;Caravanserai&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:36\n4.\t&quot;The English Ladye and the Knight&quot;[3] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:49\n5.\t&quot;Kecharitomene&quot;[4] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:34\n6.\t&quot;Penelope's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n7.\t&quot;Sacred Shabbat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n8.\t&quot;Beneath a Phrygian Sky&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:32\n9.\t&quot;Never-ending Road (AmhrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Duit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Midwinter NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream  2008\n\n\nA Midwinter Night's Dream is an album by the Canadian singer, songwriter, accordionist, harpist, and pianist Loreena McKennitt, released on October 28, 2008\n\nThe album is an extended version of A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season (1995). 8 new tracks (recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios during spring 2008) were added to the original 5 songs of the 1995 album.\nA Midwinter NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream takes the place of A Winter Garden, which has been deleted from the Quinlan Road catalogue.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The Holly &amp; The Ivy&quot; - 4:49 - (Lyric: traditional - Music: Loreena McKennitt)\n2.\t&quot;Un Flambeau, Jeannette, Isabelle&quot; - 3:06 - (Music: traditional)\n3.\t&quot;The Seven Rejoices of Mary&quot; - 4:34 - (Music &amp; Lyric: traditional)\n4.\t&quot;NoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l Nouvelet!&quot; - 5:11 - (Music &amp; Lyric: traditional)\n5.\t&quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; - 3:16 - (Music &amp; Lyric: John Mason Neale)\n6.\t&quot;Coventry Carol&quot; - 2:18 - (Lyric: traditional - Music arranged &amp; adapted by Loreena McKennitt)\n7.\t&quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; (Abdelli version) - 7:19 - (Lyric: traditional - Music arranged and adapted by Loreena McKennitt)\n8.\t&quot;Snow&quot; - 5:05 - (Lyric: Archibald Lampman - Music: Loreena McKennitt)\n9.\t&quot;Breton Carol&quot; - 3:30 - (Music: traditional)\n10.\t&quot;Seeds of Love&quot; - 4:54 - (Lyric: traditional - Music: Loreena McKennitt)\n11.\t&quot;Gloucestershire Wassail&quot; - 2:39 - (Music &amp; Lyric: traditional)\n12.\t&quot;Emmanuel&quot; - 4:55 - (Music &amp; Lyric: traditional)\n13.\t&quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; - 2:43 - (Music: Gustav Holst) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVE ALBUMS \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive in San Francisco at the Palace of Fine Arts  1994  Promotional Copy\n\n\nLive in San Francisco at the Palace of Fine Arts is an EP of the Canadian singer, songwriter, accordionist, harpist, and pianist, Loreena McKennitt.
