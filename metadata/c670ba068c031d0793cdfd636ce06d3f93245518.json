This was one of the few movies I had been waiting for an HD source for a *long* time. It's exactly the kind of movie I like to encode - the really good ones that almost no one has heard about.\n\nEncoded with a CRF of 20, which only took an average bitrate of 2417kbps for this particular movie. This means you get outstanding quality without the file size being huge. 20 is the max recommended CRF value for HD sources according to x264 developer recommendations - any higher and you run into a massive diminishing returns situation, so the other larger torrent of this movie in 720p is just simply FAR larger than it should be. This movie will always have an aged look to it, however, by nature of the type of film on which it was shot. This look is intentional and is not an encoding or quality issue. English subtitles are soft-coded into the mp4 container instead of an external .srt file.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using CRF encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c670ba068c031d0793cdfd636ce06d3f93245518","amp;dn":"Tape+%282001%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c670ba068c031d0793cdfd636ce06d3f93245518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,112,186,6,140,3,29,7,147,205,253,99,108,224,109,63,147,36,85,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
