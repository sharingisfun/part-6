Their breakout hit was 1988's &quot;What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot;, a dance/ synthpop hit which included a sample of Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from Star Trek, saying &quot;pure energy,&quot; and opened with a sample of Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), also from Star Trek, saying, &quot;It's worked so far, but we're not out yet!&quot; They are known for their loyal fan base in Brazil, Japan, Spain and Mexico.[citation needed] Information Society became part of the American response to the Second British Invasion. \n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Society 1988\n\n\n\nInformation Society is the self-titled album by synth-pop, techno, and Latin freestyle band Information Society. It was their first release under a major labe, after two independently released albums. Numerous top-40 hits quickly led the group to fame and fortune.The album was certified gold (selling 500,000 units) after five months in the U.S and also went gold in Brazil in just 10 days. The album had several chart-topping hits such as &quot;What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy),&quot; &quot;Walking Away,&quot; and &quot;Running.&quot; It was also one of the only albums released in the seldomly used CD+G format.\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; (Robb, Harland) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 4:33\n2.\t&quot;Tomorrow&quot; (Robb, Harland, Kramer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 4:11\n3.\t&quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot; (Ulvaeus, Andersson; Eleven East Corporation) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:39\n4.\t&quot;Repetition&quot; (Robb) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 4:33\n5.\t&quot;Walking Away&quot; (Robb) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 5:01\n6.\t&quot;Over the Sea&quot; (Harland) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:50\n7.\t&quot;Attitude&quot; (Robb, Harland) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 4:12\n8.\t&quot;Something in the Air&quot; (Robb) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 4:54\n9.\t&quot;Running&quot; (Konar; T-Boy Music/Murat Konar Music) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 7:41\n10.\t&quot;Make it Funky&quot; (Robb) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe2f8515a231754c24370344607be842742c986","amp;dn":"Information+Society+-+Self+Titled+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe2f8515a231754c24370344607be842742c986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,226,248,81,90,35,23,84,194,67,112,52,70,7,190,132,39,66,201,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
