But now your arch-nemesis Big stole the only thing your beloved grandpa left you: a nice pair of white, finely ribbed underpants! And heÃ¯Â¿Â½s surely up to no good. Why else would he take them to that forsaken desert? No one ever goes there, itÃ¯Â¿Â½s called Ã¯Â¿Â½that forsaken desertÃ¯Â¿Â½ for a reason. Sure, no one remembers why. But still--up to no good!\n\nAnyway, now itÃ¯Â¿Â½s up to you to save the worl--erm. Save the underpants!
