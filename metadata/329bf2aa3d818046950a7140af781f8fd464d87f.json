Still, the book was not without controversy, as certain elements \nin the Jewish community took issue with Roth's less than flattering \nportrayal of some of his characters.[1] The short story Defender of the \nFaith, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, \ncoreligionist draftees, drew particular ire. When Roth in 1962 appeared \non a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to \ndiscuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at \nhim soon turned into denunciations.[citation needed] Many accused Roth \nof being a self-hating Jew, a label that would stick with him for much \nof his career. It is often speculated that the wildly obscene comedy of \nPortnoy's Complaint (1969) was Roth's defiant reply to his early \nJewish critics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329bf2aa3d818046950a7140af781f8fd464d87f","amp;dn":"GOODBYE%2C+COLUMBUS+%28AND+5+SHORT+STORIES%29+-+Philip+Roth+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329bf2aa3d818046950a7140af781f8fd464d87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,155,242,170,61,129,128,70,149,10,113,64,175,120,31,143,212,100,216,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
