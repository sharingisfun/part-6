Her late husband's partner keeps tabs on her from a patrol car parked across the street, hoping she'll violate probation and he can send her back to prison. But the 100-foot radius her ankle bracelet allows isn't the worst of her problems. Her dead husband --now a malevolent ghost--is still in the house, where he died -- intent on savage revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6527d1b9caf876581edc90c0439a01e33210ca4e","amp;dn":"100.Feet+%282008%29+DvDrip%2C+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6527d1b9caf876581edc90c0439a01e33210ca4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,39,209,185,202,248,118,88,30,220,144,192,67,154,1,227,50,16,202,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
