Since its formation, the band's line-up had included Dexter Holland (lead vocals, guitar), Noodles (lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals), Greg K. (bass, backing vocals), and Ron Welty (drums, percussion), who left in 2003. Their current drummer is Pete Parada, formerly of Face to Face, and Saves the Day, who has been with the band since 2007.\nThe Offspring has been credited, along with fellow California punk bands Green Day and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States during the mid-1990s. To date, The Offspring has released eight studio albums, one compilation, four EPs and three DVDs. They have sold over 34 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time. Each album since the release of their final Epitaph album Smash has sold over a million units.\nSince the release of their 1994 album Smash, which is the best-selling independent label album of all time, The Offspring has achieved commercial success over five albums, with singles such as &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;. The band's next three albums, Ixnay on the Hombre, Americana and Conspiracy of One, were also successful, with Ixnay on the Hombre and Conspiracy of One reaching platinum certification, and Americana achieving multi-platinum status. Longtime drummer Ron Welty left The Offspring in early 2003, and was replaced by Atom Willard. Later that year, the band released their next album, Splinter, to moderate sales and fairly warm reviews. In 2005, The Offspring released a greatest hits album and toured in support of the compilation. Their most recent studio album, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, was released on June 17, 2008 with the hit singles &quot;You're Gonna Go Far, Kid&quot; and &quot;Hammerhead.&quot; The Offspring is currently planning a ninth studio album, which is due for release in 2010.\n\nAmericana is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band The Offspring, released on November 17, 1998 (see 1998 in music). It debuted at 2 on the US Billboard 200 with around 174,000 copies sold in its first week, and has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. This was their most successful album since their 1994 breakthrough Smash.\nSome pressings of Americana are also enhanced CD's and contain the karaoke videos of &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job?&quot;, and the previous MTV music videos from its predecessor, Ixnay on the Hombre. Many of the lyrics are of unpleasant realities of American life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8138fb6d2d216540a77e8ea63c763daaa415fede","amp;dn":"The+Offspring+-+Americana+%281998%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8138fb6d2d216540a77e8ea63c763daaa415fede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,56,251,109,45,33,101,64,167,126,142,166,60,118,61,170,164,21,254,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
