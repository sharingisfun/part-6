Everyday there are tons of mobile apps\r\nuploaded to either Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Not even\r\nmention about other alternative app stores\r\n\r\nHence, the competition can be very fierce if you are about to\r\ncreate an app from scratch. If you do not have any knowledge\r\nabout programming, the app creation process may take months or\r\neven years to complete\r\n\r\nLet us ask you a question. Will you create a wheel\r\nthat is square in shape? We bet you not. It is\r\nridiculous to re-invent the wheel and make it into\r\nanother shape\r\n\r\nAnalogously, it is unwise to create an Android app\r\nfrom nothing, unless you already have some excellent\r\nprogramming knowledge. For sure, we are not saying that\r\neveryone should NOT learning programming language\r\n\r\nHere is the truth. You may need to take months or years just to\r\nmaster those hard-to-understand programming knowledge. So, if\r\nyou easily get overwhelmed by the programming language, then this\r\ncourse is definitely for you! We will teach you create an app\r\nwithout touching any line of codes!\r\n\r\nLook, this course can provide you a simpler picture\r\nof what Android development is all about. Are you\r\nready to create your first Android app? Faster than\r\nothers? [Apps Reskinning]\r\n\r\nApps Reskinning is an alternative mobile app industry that you\r\ncan penetrate. In laymen term, reskin an app means changing the\r\ngraphics and musics of an app while maintaining its source\r\ncode. In other words, we get a source code and alter some of the\r\ngraphics and changing the music files\r\n\r\nIn this course, you will first learn how to install JDK (Java\r\nDevelopment Kit), an important virtual machine that is needed to\r\nrun Android Studio. Next, you will learn how to\r\ninstall Android Studio (the Official Integrated\r\nDevelopment Environment (IDE) for Android) and the\r\nAndroid SDK (Software Development Kit) [Source Code]\r\n\r\nThe source code is included in this course. It has\r\nbeen downloaded more than 10,000,000 times on Google Play\r\nStore. Check out our first video [App Compilation Errors - Solved!]\r\n\r\nAs you all may know, any wrong steps in importing the source code\r\nmay result in compilation errors in Android Studio. This is\r\nwhy we will teach you step-by-step how to import the source code\r\nright in the first place. There are many newbie\r\napp developers get overwhelmed on this and\r\neventually give up. We have came across those\r\npaths and we will reveal to you the smarter steps on\r\nimporting the source code. Zero errors, that is\r\nwhat you need! [Android SDK Configuration]\r\n\r\nBefore we use Android Studio, it is important to configure the\r\nAndroid SDK. There are certain important packages that you\r\nwill need to install to avoid compilation errors. Some of the\r\npackages includes:\r\n\r\n* Android SDK Tools\r\n* Android SDK Platform-tools\r\n* Android SDK Build-tools\r\n* SDK Platform and its Google APIs (Application\r\nProgramming Interfaces) for a particular Android\r\nversion\r\n* Android Support Repository\r\n* Android Support Library\r\n* Google Play services\r\n* Google Repository\r\n\r\nIf you do not properly configure the Android SDK, chances are you\r\nwill have many compilation errors. Zero errors, that is what\r\nwe will teach you! [Importing Source Code - Correctly!]\r\n\r\nImporting the Android Studio project can be quite challenging\r\nespecially if you are newbie. This may also make\r\nyou overwhelmed if you are intermediate Android\r\ndevelopers. But, we have good news for you! We\r\nhave created a comprehensive and step-by-step video\r\nfor you, just to teach you how to import the\r\nsource code correctly within minutes. Note that NOT\r\nevery code you need to &quot;touch&quot;, we will tell you\r\nwhich codes you need to make adjustment, and there\r\nis no coding or programming skills required at all! Many\r\nnewbie developers get stucked here because of the complexity of\r\nAndroid Studio. No more headache we would say! Zero\r\ncompilation errors, period [Source Code Anatomy]\r\n\r\nBy the way, we will train you to become an Android &quot;doctor&quot; who is\r\nable to &quot;diagnose&quot; the anatomy of the source code\r\nWe will tell you which codes to edit and you simply\r\nno need to understand it. We will train you how to\r\nchange the Targeted SDK, the Package Name and App\r\nName on Smartphone. Edit the string file, apply\r\nsome refactor steps, change targeted Android SDK\r\nversion. That's it! [Photoshop Mastery: Learn the Essence of Photoshop]\r\n\r\nFrankly to say that you will need to master Photoshop to\r\nsustain in the app business for the long run. If you do not have\r\nenough money to fund those programmers as well as graphic\r\ndesigners, then just do it yourself. It is not that challenging\r\nthough. We know there are many other Photoshop-alike\r\nsoftwares, but, if we were to compare the quality and the\r\nadvanced editing features, Photoshop is still a\r\nbetter choice. You may feel uncomfortable at first\r\nwhen using Photoshop, but I bet you will get used\r\nto it.
