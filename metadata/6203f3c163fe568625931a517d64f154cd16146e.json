For the first time, this concise and compelling book pierces the veil of secrecy to fully document the small, tightly-held conspiracy that killed President John F. Kennedy. It explains why he was murdered, and how it was done in a way that forced many records to remain secret for almost fifty years.\n\nThe Hidden History of JFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Assassination draws on exclusive interviews with more than two dozen associates of John and Robert Kennedy, in addition to former FBI, Secret Service, military intelligence, and Congressional personnel, who provided critical first-hand information. The book also uses government filesÃ¢â‚¬â€including the detailed FBI confession of notorious Mafia godfather Carlos MarcelloÃ¢â‚¬â€to simply and clearly reveal exactly who killed JFK. Using information never published before, the book uses MarcelloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words to his closest associates to describe the plot. His confession is also backed up by a wealth of independent documentation.\n\nThis book builds on the work of the last Congressional committee to investigate JFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder, which concluded that JFK Ã¯Â¿Â½was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that godfathers [Ã¯Â¿Â½Santo] Trafficante [and Carlos] Marcello had the motive, means, and opportunity to assassinate President Kennedy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ However, it also draws on exclusive files and information not available to Congress, that have only emerged in recent years, to fully explain for the first time how Marcello and Trafficante committedÃ¢â‚¬â€and got away withÃ¢â‚¬â€the crime of the 20th century.\n\nSome of the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revelations will be dramatized in the upcoming Warner Brothers film Legacy of Secrecy, produced by and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which also stars Robert De Niro as Carlos Marcello.\n\nThe Hidden History of JFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Assassination is the definitive account of the crime and the secrecy which has surrounded it.\n\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6203f3c163fe568625931a517d64f154cd16146e","amp;dn":"Lamar+Waldron%2C+The+Hidden+History+of+the+JFK+Assassination+epub+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6203f3c163fe568625931a517d64f154cd16146e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,3,243,193,99,254,86,134,37,147,26,81,125,100,241,84,205,22,20,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
