Symbolic Logic: Syntax, Semantics, and Proof introduces students to the fundamental concepts, techniques, and topics involved in deductive reasoning. \n\n Agler guides students through the basics of symbolic logic by explaining the essentials of two classical systems, propositional and predicate logic. Students will learn translation both from formal language into English and from English into formal language; how to use truth trees and truth tables to test propositions for logical properties; and how to construct and strategically use derivation rules in proofs. This text makes this often confounding topic much more accessible with step-by-step example proofs, chapter glossaries of key terms, hundreds of homework problems and solutions for practice, and suggested further readings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc979e954069d17edacdb0e165ef02a77ed9ef30","amp;dn":"Symbolic+Logic%3A+Syntax%2C+Semantics%2C+and+Proof+%282013%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc979e954069d17edacdb0e165ef02a77ed9ef30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,151,158,149,64,105,209,126,218,205,176,225,101,239,2,167,126,217,239,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
