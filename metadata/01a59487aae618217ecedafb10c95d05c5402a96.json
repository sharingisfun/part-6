And at the risk of being redundant, Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle is about as beautiful an album as you can expect to hear sung circa 2009. Unfolding like a first view of paradise, then a slightly less ecstatic second view of paradise and then finally a glance back over your shoulder at that stupid paradise bulls***, Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle surveys a landscape that grows organically, like the time two people spend together-or the time one person spends alone (with another). One way or another, it's awfully pretty-something's clearly making Bill feel like a natural man. And high in the saddle, with a pouch of Big League Chew and nine sweet new tunes in tow, he's riding herd over a diverse bunch of sounds by top-notch players. Arranger Brian Beattie brought some old friends back into the picture: violins and French horns. Singing as personal as ever while still spinning wild yarns and melodic guitar fictions, Bill Callahan's on an idyll we hope won't ever end.\n\nJim Cain\nEid Ma Clack Shaw\nThe Wind and the Dove\nRococo Zephyr\nToo Many Birds\nMy Friend\nAll Thoughts Are Prey to Some Beast\nInvocation of Ratiocination\nFaith/Void","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a59487aae618217ecedafb10c95d05c5402a96","amp;dn":"Bill+Callahan+-+Sometimes+I+Wish+We+Were+An+Eagle+%282009%29+%5BLossle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a59487aae618217ecedafb10c95d05c5402a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,165,148,135,170,230,24,33,126,206,218,251,16,201,93,5,197,64,42,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
