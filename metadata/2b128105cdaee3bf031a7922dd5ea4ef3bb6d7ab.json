A Yin-style class, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hold poses for five minutes or longer, as pace is always slower in such yoga classes.\n\nWith a focus on basic movements, well-roundedness, stress relief, relaxation, and sleep, this class is ideal for those days that seem to last forever and everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Take a well-deserved break and dedicate some time to &quot;grounding&quot; yourself.\n\nLauren starts the class in ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pose, and discusses how &quot;personal&quot; the yoga pose is, with some preferring open knees and the chest resting on the mat, and others a more compact posture. ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pose is ideal for helping us slow down and feel the relaxation we need to enjoy practice...and life in general!\n\nJoin Lauren and take a &quot;me&quot; break today! Feel rested yet energized once the 20 minutes are up.\n\nLevel: All Levels\nStyle: Yin\nFocus: Well-Rounded, Basics, Stress Relief, Relaxation, Sleep\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b128105cdaee3bf031a7922dd5ea4ef3bb6d7ab","amp;dn":"Lauren+Eckstrom+Yoga+-+Yin+Short+and+Sweet+20+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b128105cdaee3bf031a7922dd5ea4ef3bb6d7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,18,129,5,205,174,227,191,3,26,121,34,221,94,164,239,59,182,215,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
