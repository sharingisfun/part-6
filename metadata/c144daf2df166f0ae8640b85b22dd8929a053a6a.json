After 2006's Face the Promise, it is the second studio album since 1975 to be credited to Bob Seger rather than Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band.\n\n&quot;This album touches on how I think a lot of us feel about finding our place in a more complicated world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from how we appreciate things as simple and pure as love, to navigating through the corruption and violence that permeates the news. It sums up a lot of feelings I have about a variety of subjects.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Bob Seger talking about his motivations for Ride Out in a press release\n\nRumors about the album started to spread as far back as 2010. On July 13, 2011, Bob Seger reported via Facebook that he was recording new material at Ocean Way Recording in Nashville. A Rolling Stone article from February 16, 2012 suggested that the album would be released in September of that year,[18] but it did not come out. On April 11, 2013, Seger told the audience at a live performance in Detroit: &quot;We should have our new album out in late AugustÃ¢â‚¬â€if we are lucky.&quot; That date was also not met. The official announcement of the album was finally made on August 18, 2014.\n\nSeger stated that he really made an effort to &quot;break new ground&quot; on this album and therefore, none of the songs on it would sound quite like anything he had done before.Seger said he approached this album differently in terms of feels and speeds.\nRelease and editions\n\nThe official announcement of the album was preceded by the release of the lead single &quot;Detroit Made&quot; to radio stations on August 14, 2014. The album title, artwork and release date were announced on August 18, 2014. The album was scheduled to be released by Capitol Records on October 14, 2014. Initially, no other information besides the release date was made public. On August 28, 2014, a photograph &quot;showing a hand-written list of 13 truncated song titles on top of a studio mixing board&quot; was posted on Seger's official Facebook page. Although this appeared to be the track listing of Ride Out, the final list of songs to be included in the album was not announced officially until September 9, 2014 when the album became available \nBesides the regular 10-track album, an expanded deluxe edition with three additional tracks and different artwork is available. Both editions were released on compact disc. Target offers an exclusive version of the deluxe edition with two additional bonus tracks. The album is available as a digital download as well, although the majority of Seger's back catalog is not yet available for purchase in digital format. Unlike Seger's past few albums since 1994's Greatest Hits, Ride Out is also available on vinyl in a 180-gram pressing aimed at audiophiles.\nContent\n\nAlongside six of Seger's original compositions, the album includes a number of cover versions, which is not common for Seger as his albums usually contain no more than one or two songs that he did not write himself or in collaboration. One exception from that rule is the cover album Smokin' O.P.'s from 1972.\nCover songs\n\nOn Ride Out, Seger chose to include a total of four cover songs by well-known singer-songwriters of the country and Americana genres. Two of the songs are classics of the genre while the other two were released fairly recently.\nDetroit Made\n\nThe uptempo rock song &quot;Detroit Made&quot; was written by American singerÃ¢â‚¬â€œsongwriter John Hiatt as &quot;a musical mash note to the Buick Electra 225&quot; It was first released by Hiatt himself on his 2011 album Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns.\nThe Devil's Right Hand\n\n&quot;The Devil's Right Hand&quot; is an alternative country classic by Steve Earle from his 1988 album Copperhead Road. Versions of the song were recorded by country legends Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings among others.\n\n&quot;It was performed by Waylon Jennings, whom I've always loved, and then I found out I think about five years later that Steve Earle wrote it. I was watching the movie at home and I said 'Oh my gosh,' cause he's one of my favorite songwriters. It's a powerful combination Ã¢â‚¬â€ Steve Earle and Waylon Jennings.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Bob Seger talking about &quot;The Devil's Right Hand&quot; in the soundtrack of Betrayed (1988)\n\n\n\nIn late November 2010, it was reported that Seger had agreed to participate in an upcoming tribute album to Jennings, who passed away in 2002. The album materialized in February 2012 in the form of The Music Inside: A Collaboration Dedicated to Waylon Jennings, Volume 1. A second volume was released exactly one year later, but a scheduled third volume did not come out. Bob Seger appeared on none of these albums.\nSeger stated that his intention for his take on &quot;The Devils Right Hand&quot; for Ride Out was to stay very true to Jennings' version of the song. Seger's cover version was made available for purchase as a digital download on September 23, 2014.\n\n\n\nOf Seger's own compositions, &quot;Hey Gypsy&quot; is probably the one that he talked about the most in the years leading up to the release of Ride Out. Seger had already rehearsed the song for his 2011 tour but it eventually never made it on the set list. Seger wrote the Texas swing-styled song in homage to the late blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. Other songs that Seger previously mentioned and that are included in the album are the title track, &quot;Gates of Eden,&quot; and &quot;You Take Me In.&quot;\n\n\nTwo songs off Ride Out have been released as singles so far, namely &quot;Detroit Made&quot; and &quot;You Take Me In.&quot;\nDetroit Made\n\nThe lead single off the album is the cover song &quot;Detroit Made.&quot; Bob Seger's take on John Hiatt's song was released to radio stations on August 14, 2014, coinciding with the Woodward Dream Cruise, a classic car event that is held annually on the third Saturday of August in Metropolitan Detroit. A music video for the song showing classic cars owned by Michigan natives driving through the streets of Detroit was largely shot at this event. \n\n\n\nThe second single off the album is the ballad &quot;You Take Me In,&quot; which was released as a promotional single to radio stations. \nLive performances\n\nLong before its announcement, Seger already started trying out songs for the album at live performances.\nRock and Roll Never Forgets tour 2013\n\nSeger and his Silver Bullet Band premiered three of the songs off Ride OutÃ¢â‚¬â€namely &quot;Detroit Made,&quot; &quot;California Stars&quot; and &quot;All of the Roads&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€on their 2013 Rock and Roll Never Forgets Tour of North America, which started on February 27, 2013 in Toledo, Ohio and concluded on May 11, 2013 in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nSeger chose &quot;Detroit Made&quot; as the opening song in most of the concerts on his 2013 tour. Another song that was performed in almost all of the concerts on that tour was &quot;California Stars.&quot; Bob Seger performed the song for the first time at the opening concert of his 2013 tour, which was held in Toledo on February 27, 2013.\n\n\nRide Out tour 2014\n\nIn late August 2014 it was suggested that Seger and band would tour again in the fall of 2014 in support of Ride Out, but dates were not announced. It was reported in early September 2014 that Seger and his Silver Bullet Band had been holding rehearsals in suburban Detroit.\n\nFinally, a 23-city tour of North America was officially announced on September 25, 2014.\n\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nTo promote the album, Seger is currently making appearances on television shows.\n\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Detroit Made&quot;   \tJohn Hiatt \t3:46\n2. \t&quot;Hey Gypsy&quot;   \tBob Seger \t2:32\n3. \t&quot;The Devil's Right Hand&quot;   \tSteve Earle \t3:49\n4. \t&quot;Ride Out&quot;   \tSeger \t3:07\n5. \t&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;   \tKasey Chambers, Shane Nicholson[24] \t3:12\n6. \t&quot;California Stars&quot;   \tWoody Guthrie, Jeff Tweedy, Jay Bennett \t4:44\n7. \t&quot;It's Your World&quot;   \tSeger \t3:17\n8. \t&quot;All of the Roads&quot;   \tSeger \t3:34\n9. \t&quot;You Take Me In&quot;   \tSeger \t2:33\n10. \t&quot;Gates of Eden&quot;   \tSeger \t3:47\n11. \t&quot;Listen&quot; (feat.

A number of tiles of songs that Seger thought about including were mentioned at one point or another. Among other things, he talked about a &quot;father-daughter&quot; song called &quot;Hannah&quot; that was said to feature guest appearances by Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow. All three of them already collaborated on Kid Rock's song &quot;Collide,&quot; which was released as a single from his 2010 album Born Free.\n\nAnother song that Seger talked about in interviews is &quot;The Sea Inside,&quot; which he described as &quot;very Led Zeppelin.&quot; Other songs he mentioned recording include &quot;I'll Remember You,&quot; &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;The Price,&quot; the latter a duet with Trisha Yearwood. He also dallied with the idea of including live versions of Little Feat's &quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub, Tom Waits' &quot;Blind Love&quot; and his own &quot;Sometimes.&quot;\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nA number of prolific session musicians from Nashville worked with Seger on the album. Among them are Rob McNelley (guitar), Glenn Worf (bass), Jim &quot;Moose&quot; Brown (keyboards, guitar), and Chad Cromwell (drums). Also present is Seger's usual group of backing vocalists including Laura Creamer, Shaun Murphy and Barb Payton. Country singer and guitarist Vince Gill is a guest vocalist on the track &quot;Listen.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c144daf2df166f0ae8640b85b22dd8929a053a6a","amp;dn":"Bob+Segar+-+Ride+Out+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+mp3+320k+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c144daf2df166f0ae8640b85b22dd8929a053a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,68,218,242,223,22,111,10,232,100,11,133,178,45,216,146,154,5,58,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
