In the eyes of many radical Muslims and their Western allies, these Crusades are still going on in the new form of American Ã¢â‚¬Å“imperialism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Muslim Persecution of Christians documents the falsification of history that justifies this view. It also describe the real Ã¢â‚¬Å“crusadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now taking place Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the religious cleansing of Christians in Muslim lands. This persecution has dramatically increased worldwide in the last decade and is now worse than ever. From Egypt to Nigeria, from Iraq to Pakistan, Christians in majority-Muslim countries face a grimmer present and a more uncertain future than ever, as Islamic Jihadists step up their efforts of Islamize them or drive them out of their lands Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or kill them outright. \n\n\nAbout the author:\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of eight books on Islam and jihad.
