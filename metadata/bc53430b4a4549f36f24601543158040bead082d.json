Benyus.\n\n\n#Foreword    : Alexandra Horowitz.\n#Illustrated : Juan Carlos Barberis.\n#\n#Pages       : 480.\n#Publisher   : Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers (April 15, 2014)\n#ISBN-13     : 978-1579129682\n\n\n\nUnlock the secrets behind the behavior of the world's most fascinating\n\ncreatures-- from the AdÃƒÂ©lie penguin to the plains zebra to the giant panda-- in\n\nthis wonderfully written, beautifully illustrated book.\n\n\nIn The Secret Language of Animals, biologist Janine Benyus takes us inside the\n\nanimal kingdom and shows us the whys and the hows behind the distinctive\n\nbehavior of creatures great and small in their natural environments.\n\n\nDivided geographically into five sections--Africa, Asia, North America, the\n\noceans, and the poles--the book examines and describes the behavior, body\n\nlanguage, and patterns of communication of 20 different animals: the gorilla,\n\nlion, African elephant, plains zebra, black rhinoceros, giraffe, ostrich,\n\ngreater flamingo, Nile crocodile, giant panda, peacock, Komodo monitor,\n\nbottlenose dolphin, California sea lion, gray wolf, bald eagle, sandhill crane,\n\nbeluga whale, polar bear, and AdÃƒÂ©lie penguin.\n\n\nFor each animal, Benyus describes and explains basic behaviors (locomotion,\n\nfeeding, drinking, bathing, grooming, sleeping), communication behavior\n\n(greeting, social play, group defense, conflict, aggression/submission,\n\nfighting, courtship, copulation), and parenting behavior (birth, care and\n\nfeeding, teaching, communal care).\n\n\nThe book is illustrated throughout with tender yet precise line drawings that\n\nbeckon us to the animals and vividly capture everything from changing facial\n\nexpressions to nurturing postures to playful and aggressive interactions. The\n\ntext, too, is both intimate and informative, allowing for a deep connection\n\nwith, and a great admiration for, each one of the animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc53430b4a4549f36f24601543158040bead082d","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Language+of+Animals+-+Janine+M.+Benyus+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc53430b4a4549f36f24601543158040bead082d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,83,67,11,74,69,73,243,111,36,96,21,67,21,128,64,190,173,8,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
