J. J. Le Verrier at the Paris Observatory.  He soon tired of the drudgery; he was drawn to more romantic vistas, and at 19 wrote a book on an idea that he was to make his ownÃ¢â‚¬â€¢the habitability of other worlds.  There followed a career as FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest popularizer of astronomy, with over 60 titles to his credit.  An admirer granted him a chateau at Juvisy-sur-lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Orge, and he set up a first-rate observatory dedicated to the study of the planet Mars. Finally, in 1892, he published his masterpiece, La Planete Mars et ses conditions dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢habitabilite, a comprehensive summary of three centuriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of literature on Mars, much of it based on his own personal research into rare memoirs and archives.  As a history of that era, it has never been surpassed, and remains one of a handful of indispensable books on the red planet.\n\nSir Patrick Moore (1923-2012) needs no introduction; his record of popularizing astronomy in Britain in the 20th century equaled FlammarionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in France in the 19th century.  Moore pounded out hundreds of books as well as served as presenter of the BBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TV program Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sky at NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ program for 55 years (a world record).  Though Moore always insisted that the Moon was his chef-dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oeuvre, Mars came a close second, and in 1980 he produced a typescript of FlammarionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic.  Unfortunately, even he found the project too daunting for his publishers and passed the torch of keeping the project alive to a friend, the amateur astronomer and author William Sheehan, in 1993. Widely regarded as a leading historian of the planet Mars,  Sheehan has not only meticulously compared and corrected MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manuscript against FlammarionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original so as to produce an authoritative text, he has  added an important introduction showing the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significance in the history of Mars studies.  Here results a book that remains an invaluable resource and is also a literary tour-de-force, in which the inimitable style of Flammarion has been rendered in the equally unique style of Moore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657de47b8f972d5a57cff93514b805024d56471b","amp;dn":"Camille+Flammarion%27s+The+Planet+Mars+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657de47b8f972d5a57cff93514b805024d56471b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,125,228,123,143,151,45,90,87,207,249,53,20,184,5,2,77,86,71,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
