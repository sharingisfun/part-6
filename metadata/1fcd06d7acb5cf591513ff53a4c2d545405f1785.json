The only track I'm not too keen on is the remix of 'Don't You Want Me' at the end, which I find a bit tacky (couldn't Virgin have put 'Heart Like A Wheel' on instead?). The other tracks on the album are of at least a good standard, with my favourites being 'Love Is All That Matters', 'Together In Electric Dreams', 'Human', 'Mirror Man' and 'Tell Me When' which was the song that introduced me to the band. Overall it is a superb collection of fine electronic music.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Band. Despite a turbulent and troubled past during their 25 year history (30 if you go back to the original line-up of Phil, Martin Ware &amp; Ian Craig Marsh), the trio of Phil, Joanne &amp; Susan deserve credit for sticking together &amp; keeping themselves going (at times against the odds) and have every right to be proud of what they have achieved. For me, they are the original masters of electronic pop and having seen them at the Manchester Apollo last year, they proved they can still do the business. I feel they will be seen as an influence by many others in the electronic music world for many years to come and I must admit that if it wasn't for the Human League, I probably wouldn't have got into electronic music.
