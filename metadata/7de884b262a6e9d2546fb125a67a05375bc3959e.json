I&amp;#039;ve always thought that Billy Gould was an amazingly underrated bassist, and his work really shines on this album. The guitars are also some of the best I&amp;#039;ve heard on any Faith No More albums, and some of the choruses are downright catchy.\nThe many electronics used in the making of this album were also something different. I&amp;#039;ve never really considered Faith No More to be rap-rock or rap-metal, but there are a few moments where Mosley will start rapping (something that I&amp;#039;ve never seen Patton do). That may sound bad when you read it, but it&amp;#039;s pulled off nicely on songs like &quot;Chinese Arithmetic&quot; and &quot;The Crab Song&quot;. The overall feel of this album sounds pretty dark, definitely not as dark as &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, but more so than &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. If you&amp;#039;re a fan of the band, this one&amp;#039;s worth picking up. (from Amazon)\n\n\n01. Faster Disco\n02. Anne&amp;#039;s Song\n03. Introduce Yourself\n04. Chinese Arithmetic\n05.
