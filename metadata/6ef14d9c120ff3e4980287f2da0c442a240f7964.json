His subject matter included death, blasphemy, sadomasochism, homoeroticism, and physical deformities. He presented an extreme, Gothic, nightmare world, which could be said to border on the pornographic. Balancing this taste for the grotesque was a tendency to mysticism and an aestheticism expressed in ironic reworkings of art-historical and literary themes drawn from Rembrandt, Goya, Rubens and the late 19th-century Symbolists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ef14d9c120ff3e4980287f2da0c442a240f7964","amp;dn":"Joel-Peter+Witkin+-+Forty+Photographs+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ef14d9c120ff3e4980287f2da0c442a240f7964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,241,77,156,18,15,243,228,152,2,135,242,218,12,68,42,36,15,121,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
