At a first impression this number seems unrealistically large.\n\nBut, if we consider that the original sources of Christianity were corrupted beyond repair, that religious persecutions had destroyed many of the early documents of Christianity, that the Bible contains many contradictions to science and logic, the corruptions of the Papacy and the Church, the rampant frauds and forgeries, that so many innovations were introduced into Christianity, the influence of pagan, Assyrian and Egyptian myths, . . . ., and that the true message and teachings of Jesus were lost,\n\nThen, it becomes understandable why so many sects and denominations exist in Christianity.\n\nThis UL contains 49 titles, and examines some of the denominations in Christianity: Anglicanism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, Puritanism, Methodism, the Quakers, Mormonism, Seventh Day Adventism, Pentecostalism, etc..\n\n1- Wikipedia - List of Christian Denominations (2009)\n\n2- Knight &amp; Mason - Nineteenth Century Religion and Literature: An Introduction (2006)\n\n3- The Grounds on which Church of England Separated from Church of Rome (1911)\n\n4- Kaye - An Introduction to World Anglicanism (2008)\n\n5- Sander - Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism (1877)\n\n6- Helm - John Calvin's Ideas (2004)\n\n7- Reid - Calvin Theological Treatises (1954)\n\n8- Edmondson - Calvin's Christology (2004)\n\n9- Muller - The Unaccommodated Calvin (2000)\n\n10- McKim - Calvin and the Bible (2006)\n\n11- Kent - Wesley and Wesleyans: Religion in Eighteenth Century Britain (2004)\n\n12- Firth - Oliver Cromwell and the Rule of the Puritans in England (1900)\n\n13- Coffey &amp; Lim - Cambridge Companion to Puritanism (2008)\n\n14- Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia (2006)\n\n15- Delbanco - The Puritan Ordeal (1989)\n\n16- Payne - The Anabaptists of the 16th Century (1948)\n\n17- Roth &amp; Stayer - A Companion to Anabaptism and Spiritualism, 1521-1700 (2007)\n\n18- Andrews - The Methodists and Revolutionary America, 1760-1800 (2000)\n\n19- Ingersoll - Baptist and Methodist Faiths in America (2003)\n\n20- Davis - The Methodist Unification (2008)\n\n21- Jones - Congregationalism in Wales (2004)\n\n22- Hankins - American Evangelicals-A Contemporary History of A Mainstream Religious Movement (2008)\n\n23- Larsen &amp; Trier - Cambridge Companion to Evangelical Theology (2007)\n\n24- Holmes - The Shaping of Ulster Presbyterian Belief and Practice, 1770-1840 (2006)\n\n25- Holden - Jehovah Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement (2002)\n\n26- Hein &amp; Shattuck - The Episcopalians (2004)\n\n27- Dandelion - The Quakers: A Very Short Introduction (2008)\n\n28- Land - Historical Dictionary of Seventh-Day Adventists (2005)\n\n29- Hoshele - Christian Remnant African Folk Church: Seventh Day Adventism in Tanzania (2007)\n\n30- Strakie - The Church of England and the Bangorian Controversy, 1716-1721 (2007)\n\n31- Janes - Victorian Reformation-The Fight of Idolatry in the Church of England (2009)\n\n32- Rivers &amp; Brown - Laborers in the Vineyard of the Lord (2001)\n\n33- Sundkler &amp; Steed - A History of the Church in Africa (2004)\n\n34- Tyacke - England's Long Reformation, 1500-1800 (1998)\n\n35- Shagan - Popular Politics and the English Reformation (2003)\n\n36- Greeley - The Catholic Revolution: New Wine, Old Wineskins and the Second Vatican Council (2004)\n\n37- Wilkinson - Orientalism, Aramaic and Kabbalah in the Catholic Reformation (2007)\n\n38- Gallagher &amp; Ashcraft - Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America (2006)\n\n39- Jackson - Mormonism Explained: What Latter-Day-Saints Teach &amp; Practice (2008)\n\n40- Hanks &amp; Williams - Mormon Faith in America (2003)\n\n41- Ostling - Mormon America (2007)\n\n42- Mackall - Plain Secrets: An Outsider Among the Amish (2007)\n\n43- Mullet - The Catholic Reformation (1999)\n\n44- Clark &amp; Kaiser - Culture Wars: Catholics vs. Secularists 19th Century (2003)\n\n45- Jacobsen - Thinking in the Spirit: Theologies of Early Pentecostal Movement (2003)\n\n46- Wacker - Heaven Below: Early Pentecostals and American Culture (2001)\n\n47- Jacobsen - A Reader in Pentecostal Theology (2006)\n\n48- Kalu - African Pentecostalism: An Introduction (2008)\n\n49- Speake &amp; Bergin - Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation (2004)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c146cdf154471a5f703214da42870dceacf9cad","amp;dn":"Schisms+in+Christianity+-+Anglicanism%2C+Puritanism%2C+Methodism%2C+et","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c146cdf154471a5f703214da42870dceacf9cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,20,108,223,21,68,113,165,247,3,33,77,164,40,112,220,234,207,156,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
