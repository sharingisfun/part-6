In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Michael the 40th most successful artist on the Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists list.[8]\n\nMichael has won numerous music awards throughout his 30-year career, including three Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Male twice, four MTV Video Music Awards, four Ivor Novello Awards, three American Music Awards, and two Grammy Awards from eight nominations.[9][10]\n\nIn 2004, the Radio Academy named Michael as the most played artist on British radio between the period of 1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004.[11] The documentary A Different Story was released in 2005; it covered his personal life and professional career.[12] In 2006, George Michael announced his first tour in 15 years, the worldwide 25 Live tour, spanning three individual tours over the course of three years (2006, 2007 and 2008). \n\n\n\n\n\nFaith 1987 (Remastered 2010)\n\n\nFaith is George Michael's first solo album, released in October 1987 via Columbia Records/Epic Records. The album has won several awards including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989. To date, the album has sold over 25 million copies worldwide,[1] and received diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Faith spawned six top five singles that substantially helped it dominate the chart of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone's &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2012, the album ranked at #472 on an updated list by the magazine. The album was also notable for entering the R&amp;B albums chart at number one making it the first album by a Caucasian artist to hit the top spot on that chart, mainly due to the R&amp;B/funk-leaning singles that were released from the album, most notably, &quot;One More Try&quot;, &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; and &quot;Father Figure&quot;.\n\n\nA remastered edition of Faith was released on 31 January 2011 in UK and on 1 February 2011 in the US. It is available in several formats: Limited Edition Collectors Box Set:, Two-CD/DVD Special Edition, Two-CD Edition and iTunes LP.
