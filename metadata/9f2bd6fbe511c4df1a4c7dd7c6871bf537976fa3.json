Android is a mobile platform that is built on the top of Linux operating system. The native-code support on Android offers endless opportunities to application developers, not limited the functionality that is provided by Android framework. Pro Android C++ with the NDK is an advanced tutorial and professional reference for today's more sophisticated app developers now porting, developing or employing C++ and other native code to integrate into the Android platform to run sophisticated native apps and better performing apps in general. Using a game app case study, this book explores tools for troubleshooting, debugging, analyzing memory issues, unit testing, unit test code coverage, performance measurement, on native applications, as well as integrating  the Android NDK toolchain into existing Autoconf, Makefile, CMake, or JAM based build systems. Pro Android C++ with the NDK also covers the following: \nÃ‚Â·        \nThe Android platform, and getting up to speed with the Android NDK, and exploring the APIs that are provided in native space.\nAn overview of Java Native Interface (JNI), and auto-generating JNI code through Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).\nAn introduction to Bionic API, native networking. native multithreading, and the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) support.\nNative graphics and sound using JNI Graphics, OpenGL ES, and OpenSL ES.\nDebugging and troubleshooting native applications using Logging, GNU Debugger (GDB), Eclipse Debugger, Valgrind, strace, and other tools.\nProfiling native code using GProf to identify performance bottlenecks, and NEON/SIMD optimization from an advanced perspective, with tips and recommendations.\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\nWhat is the Android platform, and getting up to speed with the Android NDK.\nUsing the Eclipse IDE to streamline developing native applications\nHow to use Java Native Interface (JNI) to connect native code to Java world.\nAuto-generate JNI code using Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).\nIntroduction to Bionic API\nNetworking through POSIX sockets\nDeveloping multithreaded applications using POSIX Threads, and Java Threads.\nDebug through Logging, GNU Debugger (GDB), and Eclipse Debugger\nAnalyze memory issues through Valgrind\nC++ Support and Standard Template Library STL\nNative Graphics through JNI Graphics and OpenGL ES\nNative Sound through OpenSL ES\nProfiling the native code using GProf to identify performance bottlenecks\nOptimize code using SIMD/NEON\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for software professionals who are interested in leveraging the Android NDK to port their existing native-code app, such as C++, to the Android platform, as well as existing Android developers who are interested in improving their apps overall performance by utilizing native-code.
