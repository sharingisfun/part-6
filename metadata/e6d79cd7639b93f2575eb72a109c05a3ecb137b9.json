Known for her hilariously acerbic observations on her blog, People I Want to Punch in the Throat, Mann now brings her sharp wit to bear on suburban life, marriage, and motherhood in this laugh-out-loud collection of essays. From the politics of joining a play group, to the thrill of mothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ night out at the gun range, to the rewards of your most meaningful relationship (the one you have with your cleaning lady), nothing is sacred or off-limits. So the next time you find yourself wearing fuzzy bunny pajamas in the school carpool line or accidentally stuck at a co-workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swingers party, just think, What would Jen Mann do? Or better yet, buy her book.\n\nReviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“People I Want to Punch in the Throat is so good that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you want to adopt all the cats in the world.
