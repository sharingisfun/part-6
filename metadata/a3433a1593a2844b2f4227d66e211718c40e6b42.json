Band 320cbr (Big Papi) 80's R&amp;B Soul \n\n\n\nSource: Crunchy CD\n\n\nBy M. JACKSON\n\nThough it's missing a few of their OTHER &quot;Finest&quot; songs, such as &quot;Just The Way You Like It&quot;. They MORE than make up for it by providing you the Club/ALBUM versions of the songs. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are the genius behind the songs in reference to writing and production. Prince making them choose between being in the slamming group, The Time or going out on their own, wouldn't of made the 1980s R&amp;B Reign Possible. They wrote and produced too many R&amp;B hits of too many artists back in the 80s to list.\n\nI've had the pleasure to personally Hip(introduce) my Non Minority friends to these songs/Groups; most never heard (of) them until they were TRAPPED riding in my car or in my room (only my music is played).\n\nIt has some of the best Club songs on this CD, FAST and SLOW. I put them in order of preference and which track (listed on the CD) after the songs themselves.\n\nAlexander O'Neal, Cherrele, SOS Band, Janet Jackson... the Songs &quot;Can You Treat Me Like She Does&quot; and &quot;Keep Your Eye On Me&quot; (the horns in that cut is slamming).\n\nThe only reason I gave this 4.5 instead of 5Stars is the last song, &quot;What's Wrong With Our Love Affair&quot;; it's not a BAD song, just sounds out of place. Inspite of Mary Davis voice.\n\nBoy did she get too High when she left SOS Band.\n\n1. Take Your Time (Do It Right), 7.\n2. The Finest, 5.\n3. Even When You Sleep, 2.\n4. Weekend Girl, 4.\n5. Tell Me If You Still Care, 3.\n6. Just Be Good To Me, 1.\n7. Sands Of Time, 6.\n8. No One's Gonna Love You, 8.\n9. High Hopes, 9.\n\nA lot of them tie (especially the slow cuts) but I had to give numbers. Oh, if you're NEW to this here SOS and 80s in general, don't forget to check out Loose Ends, MTUME, Roger/Zapp, Kool &amp; the Gang, Atlantic Star, The Time, Cameo &amp; Con Funk Shun (Owwwwwww!!!!), Midnight Star, Sade, Anita,... and many others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3433a1593a2844b2f4227d66e211718c40e6b42","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+the+S.O.S.+Band+320cbr+80%27s+R%26amp%3BB+Soul+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3433a1593a2844b2f4227d66e211718c40e6b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,67,58,21,147,162,132,75,47,66,39,214,110,33,23,24,196,14,107,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
