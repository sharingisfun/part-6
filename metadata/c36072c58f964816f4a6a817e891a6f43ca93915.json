Presented by Christopher Morris, On the Hour covers all of the important stories such as, &quot;Glass-faced man too disgusting for trial!&quot;, &quot;International string measurements agreed!&quot; and &quot;More oxygen needed says France!&quot;\n\nSupporting Morris is a range of fearless correspondents, including vapid US reporter Barbara Wintergreen; environmental reporter Rosy May; religious commentator Monsignor Treeb-Lopez, the terribly incompetent Peter O'Hanraha-Hanrahan; Radio 1 DJ Wayne Carr; and the monstrous face of sport, Alan Partridge.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \nOn The Hour is widely considered to be one of, if not the, greatest radio comedy series of the 1990s. It is a brilliant satire on the world of radio news.\n\nThe comedy went onto to become the television show The Day Today, allowing people to see the stars of the show in the flesh.\n\nAs if the quality of the surreal comedy and biting satire delivered by On The Hour is not enough in itself to justify the show's importance, this series also gave some of the greatest modern British comedians their first big break... most notably Chris Morris and producer Armando Iannucci. On The Hour was also the birthplace of Steve Coogan's most famous creation, Alan Partridge.\n\n\nStarring:\nChris Morris\nSteve Coogan\nRebecca Front\nDoon Mackichan\nPatrick Marber\nDavid Schneider\n\nWriters:\nChris Morris\nArmando Iannucci\nRichard Herring\nStewart Lee\nDavid Quantick\nSteven Wells\nAndrew Glover\nRebecca Front\nDoon Mackichan\nSteve Coogan\nDavid Schneider\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/on_the_hour/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/on_the_hour/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOn The Hour - S00 - E00 - Trailer\nOn The Hour - S00 - E01 - Pilot\n\nOn The Hour - S01 - E01\nOn The Hour - S01 - E02\nOn The Hour - S01 - E03\nOn The Hour - S01 - E04\nOn The Hour - S01 - E05\nOn The Hour - S01 - E06 - Xmas Special\n\nOn The Hour - S02 - E01\nOn The Hour - S02 - E02\nOn The Hour - S02 - E03\nOn The Hour - S02 - E04\nOn The Hour - S02 - E05\nOn The Hour - S02 - E06\nOn The Hour - S02 - E07 - Newsbanger\nOn The Hour - S02 - E08 - 1992 Round-Up\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n\n[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36072c58f964816f4a6a817e891a6f43ca93915","amp;dn":"On+The+Hour+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36072c58f964816f4a6a817e891a6f43ca93915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,96,114,197,143,150,72,22,244,166,168,23,232,145,166,244,60,169,57,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
