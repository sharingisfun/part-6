The Beautiful Edible Garden shares how to not only grow organic fruits and vegetables, but also make your garden a place of year-round beauty that is appealing, enjoyable, and fits your personal style. Written by a landscape design team that specializes in artfully blending edibles and ornamentals together, The Beautiful Edible Garden shows that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible for gardeners of all levels to reap the best of both worlds. Featuring a fresh approach to garden design, glorious photographs, and ideas for a range of spacesÃ¢â‚¬â€from large yards to tiny patiosÃ¢â‚¬â€this guide is perfect for anyone who wants a gorgeous and productive garden.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd15181b8a71dc46bc9bcbe40f4f25040af01f24","amp;dn":"The+Beautiful+Edible+Garden%3A+Design+A+Stylish+Outdoor+Space+Usin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd15181b8a71dc46bc9bcbe40f4f25040af01f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,21,24,27,138,113,220,70,188,155,203,228,15,79,37,4,10,240,31,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
