Unwanted visitors had arrived again. But this time, they're not alien; they're human.\r\n\r\nClaiming to have followed the course of a colony ship launched a millennium ago when Earth wrestled with resource wars and climate change, the mission commander, Antonio GarcÃ­a, requests a meeting with the planet's leaders. The Earthers profess a kinship with all humans, and their great desire is to have MÃ©ridien join their United Earth (UE).\r\n\r\nAlex Racine journeys to MÃ©ridien to investigate and uncover the Earthers' intentions. In the Haraken world, SADEs (self-aware digital entities) have been freed from their boxes aboard the MÃ©ridien-built starships. The mobile SADEs are powerful players in Alex's strategies, inventing ingenious methods to investigate the Earthers and their ship.\r\n\r\nComplicating matters, the MÃ©ridien leadership is in turmoil. The Council Leader insists her people ignore the Earthers, but this path has costs. As tensions escalate, GarcÃ­a sends a request for support to his superiors back on Earth, lest his discovery of the rich, MÃ©ridien worlds, boasting unbelievable advanced technology, slip through his grasp. A UE battleshiop heeds the call, escalating the pressure for action.\r\n\r\nJoin the journey as the Harakens and MÃ©ridiens work together to protect their planets, and their way of life, from the newest invaders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Grover Gardner\r\nLength: 10 hrs and 56 mins \r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:07-18-16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f49cf1230bff70a1309eabaf6d3b582feeb26e11","amp;dn":"S.H.+Jucha+-+Haraken+%28Silver+Ships+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f49cf1230bff70a1309eabaf6d3b582feeb26e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,156,241,35,11,255,112,161,48,158,171,175,109,59,88,47,238,178,110,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
