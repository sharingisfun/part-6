Break Away (3:23)\n10. The Rest Of My Life (3:29)\n\nAranda fans should find the Oklahoma City-bred band's sophomore album worth the four-year wait, for it's certainly worth its sonic weight in gold, bringing on a 10-song load of the kind of hard-edged, guitar-driven, melodic, made-to-be-played-loud music that distinguished their 2008 self-titled debut.\n\nYou won't confuse the title song with the Anthony Newley stage musical of the same name when drummer Mike Walker stomps out a four-count on that bass drum, setting Dameon Aranda's guitar into grinding motion while Dameon and brother Gabe's voices begin to soar: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I've laid with fools / Shook hands with the devil to break free from the rules Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Definitely not one of your Granny's favorite show tunes.\n\nNor is the album's single release, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Undone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its wailing-wall of guitar, nimble-fingered, high-register solo runs and vocal-harmony drama. One begins to get the notion that someone knows the pain of betrayal and heartbreak from the angry power-balladry of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SatisfiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the equally angry but much more rapid-fire rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“One More Lie.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIf nothing else, the music these brothers make can certainly telegraph what feels like honest emotion. The blues-tinged Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey Sally,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its warbling Hammond B3 organ (courtesy guest keyboardist Dan Walker) and Memphis-R&amp;B-influenced rhythm guitar work is another prime example of that quality, painted in colors vaguely reminiscent of the Stones' Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black and BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ period, although it won't force Mick and Keith into retirement.\n\nHelmed by Grammy-nominated producer Johnny K (Disturbed, Sevendust, Staind), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stop the WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a worthy follow-up to their debut, and Aranda will celebrate it with a CD release show at 7 p.m. Saturday on the stage of the Diamond Ballroom, 8001 S Eastern Ave. [by Gene Triplett from NewsOK]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071fe9e2546f30b96263d39c6ad708a15919aca3","amp;dn":"Aranda+-+Stop+The+World+%282012%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071fe9e2546f30b96263d39c6ad708a15919aca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,31,233,226,84,111,48,185,98,99,211,156,106,215,8,161,89,25,172,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
