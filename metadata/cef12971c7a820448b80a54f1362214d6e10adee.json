Over the past 50 years the term has crept into popular culture, served as a topic for jokes, frightened the public in media headlines, and slandered innumerable people and institutions. It has also been the subject of learned discussion from many angles: history, sociology, psychology, psychotherapy, and marketing. Despite this variety, to date there has been one angle missing: any serious reference to real brains. Descriptions of how opinions can be changed, whether by persuasion, deceit, or force, have been almost entirely psychological.\n\n 336 pages\n\t\n2006 Aug 24\n\t\t\nBook length\n\t\nPublication date\n\t\t\nPublisher \tOxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (August 24, 2006)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t0199204780\nISBN-13 \t978-0199204786\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/ganANaaeI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/ganANaaeI&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Brainwashing-Science-Thought-Kathleen-Taylor/dp/0199204780/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372459039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brainwashing+kathleen+taylor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Brainwashing-Science-Thought-Kathleen-Taylor/dp/0199204780/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372459039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brainwashing+kathleen+taylor&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef12971c7a820448b80a54f1362214d6e10adee","amp;dn":"Brainwashing%3A+The+Science+of+Thought+Control++%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef12971c7a820448b80a54f1362214d6e10adee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,241,41,113,199,168,32,68,139,128,165,79,19,98,33,77,110,16,173,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
