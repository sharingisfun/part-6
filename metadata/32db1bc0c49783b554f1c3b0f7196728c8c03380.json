Series volumes cover the major specialty areas of surgical pathology, and coverage emphasizes the key entities and diagnoses that pathologists will see in practice, and that they must know whether in training or practice. The emphasis is on the basic morphology with newer techniques represented where they are frequently used. The series provides a handy summary and quick reference that any pathology resident or fellow will find useful. Experienced practitioners will find the series valuable as a portable &quot;refresher course&quot; or review tool.\n\nLymph Nodes presents the full gamut of lymph node disorders and diagnoses that pathologists commonly see in practice. Traditional morphology and histopathologic features, coupled with clinical data, are emphasized. Chapters are complemented with both high-power images for analysis of cytologic features of lymph node cells as well as low-power images for assessment of lymph node architecture.\n\nThe chapters cover infectious lymphadenopathies, reactive lymphadenopathies, lymphadenopathies associated with systemic disorders, lymph node inclusions, spindle cell neoplasms of lymph nodes, foreign body lymphadenopathies, mature B-cell neoplasms, precursor lymphoid neoplasms, Hodgkin lymphoma, and more. Lymph Nodes is highly illustrated throughout and provides residents and clinicians with a quick reference for rotation or review.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32db1bc0c49783b554f1c3b0f7196728c8c03380","amp;dn":"Lymph+Nodes+%28Demos+Medical%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32db1bc0c49783b554f1c3b0f7196728c8c03380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,219,27,192,196,151,131,181,84,241,195,176,247,25,103,40,200,192,51,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
