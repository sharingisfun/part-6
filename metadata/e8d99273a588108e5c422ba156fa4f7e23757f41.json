None of the talk stations are included and the entire SF-UR station is not included as well. Popular songs missing include &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;White Wedding&quot; and many more. Playback FM and Radio Los Santos were combined into one CD, thus resulting into many songs not appearing on the soundtrack. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes From Uploader: This was taken from an older torrent which did not have proper tags so I decided to tag everything correctly using iTunes and re-upload. I went a step further and tagged the year each song was released.\r\n\r\nIf you want to convert to FLAC, use dBpoweramp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d99273a588108e5c422ba156fa4f7e23757f41","amp;dn":"GTA%3A+San+Andreas+Soundtrack+%28Box+Set%29+%5BALAC%5D+%7EBeerKey%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d99273a588108e5c422ba156fa4f7e23757f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,217,146,115,165,136,16,142,92,66,43,161,86,250,79,126,35,117,127,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
