There were ten plagues.\n\nI used to read the adventures of Asterix when I was younger, and I was always delighted. But, watching this movie made me think differently: has the little 'Gaullois' village given up? the movie seems only made to guarantee commercial success: many famous people (many of whom are known only in France, plus some guest stars), special effects, big marketing, etc... But, in the end, the jokes are not very good, the special effects are sometime ridiculous, the plot is far fetched and the frequent appearance of guest stars doesn't manage to fill this rather empty movie (in fact, it ended getting on my nerves).\n\nI don't know if children will find this movie funny, but it's really difficult for anybody without 'laughing potion' to take real pleasure here. Too bad for Benoit Poolevoerde, who has done his best to save the Titanicus!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e796781d9d9bdf4fc84baeaf492451c9c408a75","amp;dn":"Asterix+at+the+Olympic+Games+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e796781d9d9bdf4fc84baeaf492451c9c408a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,121,103,129,217,217,189,244,252,132,186,234,244,146,69,28,156,64,138,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
