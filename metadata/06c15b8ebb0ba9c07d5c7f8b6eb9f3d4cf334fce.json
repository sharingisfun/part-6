Under Monty's watchful eye, three hopefuls who are passionate about learning these trades are put through their paces by the country's leading practitioners of wood craft, metalwork, thatching, stonemasonry, weaving and stained glass. After six weeks of apprenticeship and labour, their work and achievements are judged by experts in their chosen field to see who has best mastered the craft.\n\n\n\n3)  Blacksmithing \nUnder Monty Don's watchful eye, three hopefuls who are passionate about learning the craft of the blacksmith are put through their paces by the country's leading practitioners. It takes four to five years to train properly as a blacksmith. During their six-week course, our trainees learn the foundations of the craft - from how to forge precision decorative panels, to making their own tools. They are instructed by Don Barker, who has made ironwork for the royal family.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1952/mastercraftsscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1952/mastercraftsscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9807/mastercraftsscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9807/mastercraftsscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8647/mastercraftsscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8647/mastercraftsscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5729/mastercraftsscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5729/mastercraftsscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/175/mastercraftsscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/175/mastercraftsscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/9026/mastercraftsscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/9026/mastercraftsscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/7618/mastercraftsscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/7618/mastercraftsscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4672/mastercraftsscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4672/mastercraftsscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/8286/mastercraftsscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/8286/mastercraftsscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1615 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 480\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: Parts 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7147998/Monty-Don-on-Mastercrafts.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7147998/Monty-Don-on-Mastercrafts.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c15b8ebb0ba9c07d5c7f8b6eb9f3d4cf334fce","amp;dn":"BBC+Mastercrafts+3of6+Blacksmithing+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c15b8ebb0ba9c07d5c7f8b6eb9f3d4cf334fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,193,91,142,187,11,169,192,125,92,127,139,110,185,243,212,207,51,79,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
