The album debuted at number 11 on the Billboard 200, selling 41,000 copies in its first week. In Australia, the album debuted at number 19. It had sold 200,000 copies in the US as of September 2010, making it one of their highest selling albums to date.\n\nAccording to an interview on the DVD The Making of Crack the Skye, this album represents the element of aether, which is represented by the souls and spirits of all things, a theme closely related to the context of the album. Because the elements of fire, water and earth have already represented by the band's first three albums Remission, Leviathan and Blood Mountain, respectively, the element of air is the only classical element which has yet to be represented by a Mastodon album, as their follow-up studio album The Hunter does not represent an element, nor is it a concept album.\n\nCrack the Skye is the first studio album to feature drummer Brann Dailor as the band's third lead vocalist.\n\n\nMusical and lyrical themes\n\nDrummer Brann Dailor described the album as more &quot;focused&quot; than its predecessor, Blood Mountain: &quot;Maybe there was a deeper heart to this record that needed more exploringÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ We got more involved with feeling the vibe of the record and everything feels more creepy and spaced out and something special is going on.&quot;\n\nVocalist/bassist Troy Sanders said in an interview with Stereogum, &quot;Crack The Skye is a departure from everything we've previously recorded in the sense that we kinda strapped on our aeroshells and departed from Earth for a while, and then captained to the ethereal element of the universe and kind of slept on the roof of the world for a while to get a perspective on this record. ... Basically we're exploring the ethereal world. We're dissecting the dark matter that dominates the universe, in a nutshell.&quot;\n\nWhen asked in multiple interviews Dailor said the record would tell a story dealing variously with the art aesthetics of Tsarist Russia, astral travel, out of body experiences and Stephen Hawking's theories on wormholes.\n\n    \n\nDailor has also said that &quot;Crack the Skye&quot; is meant as an homage to his sister, Skye Dailor, who committed suicide at age 14.\n\n    &quot;My sister passed away when I was a teenager and it was awful, and there's no better way to pay tribute to a lost loved one than having an opportunity to be in a group with my friends and we make art together. Her name was Skye, so Crack the Skye means a lot of different things. For me personally, it means the moment of being told you lost someone dear to you, [that moment] is enough to crack the sky.&quot;\n\nScott Kelly, who guested on the title track, has this to say about the song:\n\n    &quot;that song was a really, really heavy song to do. That song was about BrannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister and how she passed away, and it was a story that I was very familiar with from knowing Brann. When he decided to do that, he called me up to talk to me about it and said Ã¢â‚¬Å“this is what I wanna doÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I really, really want you to sing the songÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and I said, you know Ã¢â‚¬Å“sure, I willÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I took it really seriously and I emailed with BrannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dad a couple of times and just talked to him about Skye, and then he sent me a photograph of her actually, and I sat there and looked at that photograph of her and just kinda meditated on her and on all of the situation, and the family and then actually set all that shit up in the studio and recorded the song with her picture there, and I just really tried to do it as real as I felt I could. &quot; songs written and composed by Mastodon, except &quot;Crack the Skye&quot; (additional lyrics by Scott Kelly). \nNo. \tTitle \tLead vocals \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Oblivion&quot;   \tBrann Dailor, Troy Sanders, Brent Hinds \t5:46\n2. \t&quot;Divinations&quot;   \tHinds, Sanders \t3:38\n3. \t&quot;Quintessence&quot;   \tHinds, Sanders \t5:27\n4. \t&quot;The Czar&quot;\n\n    I. &quot;Usurper&quot;\n    II. &quot;Escape&quot;\n    III. &quot;Martyr&quot;\n    IV. &quot;Spiral&quot;  \n\n\tHinds, Sanders \t10:54\n5. \t&quot;Ghost of Karelia&quot;   \tSanders, Hinds \t5:24\n6. \t&quot;Crack the Skye&quot; (featuring Scott Kelly) \tSanders, Dailor, Scott Kelly \t5:54\n7. \t&quot;The Last Baron&quot;   \tHinds, Sanders \t13:00\nTotal length:\n\t50:03\n\nMastodon\n\n    Brann Dailor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, lead vocals on &quot;Oblivion&quot;\n    Brent Hinds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, guitar\n    Bill Kelliher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Troy Sanders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, bass\n\nOther\n\n    Rich Morris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, synth and mellotron\n    Scott Kelly - lead vocals on &quot;Crack the Skye&quot;\n    Brendan O'Brien  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production, mixing\nHeavy these guys are gonna be around for quite awhile .....anyway  Seed it if you keep it..................seed........seed.........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e30a66b693a29520d8fb45f2c151a97ba779a482","amp;dn":"Mastodon+-+Crack+The+Skye++2+CD++MP3++CBR+320k++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e30a66b693a29520d8fb45f2c151a97ba779a482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,10,102,182,147,162,149,32,216,251,69,242,193,81,169,123,167,121,164,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
