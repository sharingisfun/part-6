Baker's delicate tenor, having won the hearts of thousands of teenage fans, was considered somewhat of a novelty to most critics. For another, his guitar-and-bass accompaniment is incredibly sparse, and while that doesn't hurt his trumpeting at all, being so prominent in the mix occasionally betrays his vocal limitations. Baker's fans, though, need not worry about such petty analysis, for the wistful, tormented tone of this record is the very sound that helped create the legend, and in places he is firmly in his element, especially on 'There's a Lull in My Life' and a sublime instrumental version of 'Little Girl Blue,' which features some of his finest soloing. While it isn't the place to start, Embraceable You is a fascinating example of why Chet Baker's tragic spirit remains as attractive today as it was in his lifetime. - AMG \n\nChetbakertribute.com:\nOn December 9, 1957, Chet went into the studio to record 4 original Bob Zieff tunes for Dick Bock. After those tracks were laid down, Chet, bassist Ross Savakus and guitarist David 'Buck' Wheat stayed behind and recorded old standards into the night. The arrangements were simple, the sound was intimate, and most of these tracks were laid down in one take. Bock shelved the recordings, feeling there were too depressing. They were finally released in 1995 after his death. \n\nDick Bock was right, in that this was not the swinging recordings in the same vein as recent recordings such as Playboys or The Route. However, we get a glimpse of the Chet Baker we will see later in the 1980's when he recording as a trio with just a guitar or piano and bass. The minimal accompaniment sometimes shows the flaws in Chet's singing, but these imperfections just end up adding to the bittersweet, melancholy mood of this CD. The trumpet solos on Little Girl Blue and What Is There To Say are some of Chet's most moving. \n\nAmazon reviewer:\nFor my taste, this is the best recording of the great Chet Baker. It certainly must rank as one of the finest recordings of this very prolific artist for any Chet fan. The recording maximizes his numerous strengths, which culminate in his ability to create a sense of subtle poetry in music. He does this here primarily as vocalist with the backing of ( only ) an excellent nylon-string ( classical ) guitarist and double- bassist. This setting lets Baker shine in his subtle rhythmic and melodic nuances. Baker is widely known for his 'laid-back cool,' and he is more laid-back and cool here than anywhere else. I've even used the recording to lull children to sleep ( what a hip way to go )! The fact that this recording was unreleased for many decades speaks volumes about the music business. \n\nAMG:\nA ballad collection that emphasizes Chet Baker's troubled-romantic vocal style.
