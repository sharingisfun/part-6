HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to accept that his life will never be the same again, but when she has to leave for New York the distance becomes more than either of them expected. Tate is left alone with not only an empty bed but also a thousand thoughts running through his head. Insecurities soar as he wonders if he could ever really be the kind of man Savannah deserves. When the demons of his past continue to threaten the future he so desperately craves, Tate knows he has to make the ultimate choice. Risk destroying his relationship and his family with one life changing decision, or gamble on fate and hope the past stays exactly thatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the past. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2dc33a0eba3a3069da0e2acce64e177eebe8f06","amp;dn":"Breathless+by+Rachel+Brookes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2dc33a0eba3a3069da0e2acce64e177eebe8f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,220,51,160,235,163,163,6,157,160,226,172,206,100,225,119,238,190,143,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
