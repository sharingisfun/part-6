As his friends look for newer more dangerous sensations they crash and burn one-by-one. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA fool and his money. In the 1930s, Adam Fenwick-Symes is part of the English idle class, wanting to marry the flighty Nina Blount. He&amp;#039;s a novelist with a hundred-pound advance for a manuscript confiscated by English customs. He spends the next several years trying to get money and to set a wedding date: he trades in gossip, wins money on wagers then gives it to a drunken major who&amp;#039;s suggested he bet on a horse in an upcoming race. Adam tries to get the money back, but can&amp;#039;t find the major. Meanwhile, Nina needs security, friends drink too much, and general unhappiness spoils the party. Then war breaks out. Is Adam&amp;#039;s bright youth dimming with the fall of an empire?\n\nThe Directorial debut of Stephen Fry.\n\nCast:\n\nStephen Campbell Moore ...  Adam Fenwick-Symes \nEmily Mortimer ...
