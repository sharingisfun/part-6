These robots \r\nfollow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human \r\nbeing or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must \r\ndo whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't \r\nconflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such \r\ndefence doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the \r\nthree laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. \r\nRobotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he \r\ncommitted suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks \r\nhe was murdered, and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself \r\nSonny. However, if it was Sonny, then it means he would've had to have \r\nbroken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must \r\nnow discover the truth before it's too late.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Will Smith.\r\n=&gt;-Bridget Moynahan.\r\n=&gt;-Bruce Greenwood.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Alex Proyas.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Mystery : Sci-Fi.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2004.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.35 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 683 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 54mn.\r\n=&gt;-I Robot 2004...............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_robot/\r\n=&gt;-I Robot 2004...............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-robot/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 566 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 208 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18423e812af695f4c204ef5e50e4b48d60335299","amp;dn":"I+Robot+-+Will+Smith+Sci-Fi+2004+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18423e812af695f4c204ef5e50e4b48d60335299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,66,62,129,42,246,149,244,194,4,239,94,80,228,180,141,96,51,82,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
