Probably nothing IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever done has topped the music I made with Van Dyke Parks, my old crew in the studio and the voices of my youth-me and the Beach Boys.\nSo, even though IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m smiling through the tears, knowing that Carl and Dennis arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t here to share this moment, I am smiling. And I hope this music makes you smile too. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I wrote it all those years ago.
