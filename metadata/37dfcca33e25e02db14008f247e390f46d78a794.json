The list may be limited, but SpongeBob stands out from the rest. Relentlessly optimistic SpongeBob SquarePants lives in the undersea township of Bikini Bottom, along with an assortment of zany supporting characters. Among them is his best friend, the lovable - but dim - sea star named Patrick; the irritable perfectionist neighbor named Squidward; and an athletic squirrel named Sandy who lives in an undersea treedome. SpongeBob is employed as a fry cook at the local burger place, The Krusty Krab, which is operated by a penny-pinching old crustacean named Mr. Krabs. The show launched in the summer of 1999, and quickly became one of the highest-rated cartoons on television. The show has a wide and loyal fan base. In fact, many celebrities are taken away by SpongeBob&amp;#039;s antics!\n\nFor full episode listing, see here @ TV.com &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/spongebob-squarepants/show/3428/episode_guide.html?season=4&amp;tag=season_dropdown;dropdown;3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/spongebob-squarepants/show/3428/episode_guide.html?season=4&amp;tag=season_dropdown;dropdown;3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease note that episode 26 was not included on the DVD&amp;#039;s of season 4 since it was produced at a later moment.
