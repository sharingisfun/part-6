He will now have to live his life sentence on the prison planet Omega. The few that survive there do it by committing crimes. And the more adept the planet inmates are at higher crime, the more they climb their bizarre anti-social ladder. They all must live in a society where drug addiction is mandatory, as is the worship of the Dark One. Barrent's goal is to find why he was sent to this mad world and to clear his name and return to Earth. But first he must survive - for a life sentence on Omega is usually a short sentence indeed.\n\n\nRead by Mark Douglas Nelson\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bfd15c9b97455888869763ba1f85c592a3afa8","amp;dn":"Robert+Sheckley+-+The+Status+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bfd15c9b97455888869763ba1f85c592a3afa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,191,209,92,155,151,69,88,136,134,151,99,186,31,133,197,146,163,175,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
