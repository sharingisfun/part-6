The Chicago native also delved into professional songwriting, penning tunes for Kenny Rogers and the St. Elmo's Fire soundtrack before landing a solo contract with EMI Records. Featuring production from David Cole, who later launched C+C Music Factory, Marx's self-titled debut was released in 1987 and catapulted the artist to the top of the Billboard charts. &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot; and &quot;Should've Known Better&quot; were slick, radio-ready singles that emphasized guitar riffs and power chords, but Marx's real strength lay with ballads like &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; and &quot;Hold on to the Nights.&quot; By the time Repeat Offender arrived in 1989, Marx had already established his presence on the charts; nevertheless, the album helped make him a genuine star, with &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; marking his third consecutive number one hit in America. Another song, &quot;Angelia,&quot; was Marx's record-breaking seventh consecutive single to crack the Top Five.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Don't Mean Nothing\n02.Endless Summer Nights\n03.Now And Forever\n04.Should've Known Better\n05.Angelia\n06.Hold On To The Nights\n07.Angel's Lullaby\n08.Take This Heart\n09.Satisfied\n10.Until I Find You Again\n11.Hazard\n12.The Way She Loves Me\n13.Keep Coming Back\n14.Children Of The Night\n15.Touch Of Heaven\n16.Right Here Waiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n              ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1392517c1591d443f95fd0d5c340f899957326","amp;dn":"Richard+Marx+-+Greatest+Hits+%281997%29+MP3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1392517c1591d443f95fd0d5c340f899957326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,19,146,81,124,21,145,212,67,249,95,208,213,195,64,248,153,149,115,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
