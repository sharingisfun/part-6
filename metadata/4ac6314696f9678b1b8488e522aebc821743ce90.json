He has a degree in Physics, Graduated with honors from The Navel Academy, Knows the Bible inside and out, LOVES JESUS, speaks Greek and Hebrew and can prove the Bible is The Divine Word of Yahweh our Creator with Math and Science. He is the Grand PUPA of all Bible Scholars. (in my humble opinion)\n\nDescription\n\n&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; - John 3:16\n\nBecause of its emphasis on &quot;the Love of God&quot; and Jesus' being the incarnation of that Love, many believe this gospel is the most important for new and old Christians alike to take to heart. Written by the &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;, the book of John is organized around seven miracles, seven discourses and seven &quot;I AM&quot; statements. This study is so deep &quot;an elephant can bathe in it, and yet an infant can wade in it.&quot;\n\nThis study contains 20 hours of verse by verse teachings\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, to Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac6314696f9678b1b8488e522aebc821743ce90","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+The+Word+-+013+-+Chuck+Missler+-+The+Book+of+John+-+NEW+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac6314696f9678b1b8488e522aebc821743ce90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,198,49,70,150,249,103,139,27,132,136,229,34,174,188,130,23,67,206,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
