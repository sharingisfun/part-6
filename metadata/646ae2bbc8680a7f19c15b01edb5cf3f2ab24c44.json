By concentrating direct sunlight using mirrors and/or lenses, much higher operating temperatures are achieved, allowing existing solar technologies to covert energy at much higher efficiencies than usual. CSP includes both Concentrating Solar Thermal (CST) as well as Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) systems, which can work in tandem to generate heat and power for electricity production, industrial chemistry, process heat and even combined cooling, heating and power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646ae2bbc8680a7f19c15b01edb5cf3f2ab24c44","amp;dn":"Concentrating+solar+power+technology%3A+Principles%2C+developments+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646ae2bbc8680a7f19c15b01edb5cf3f2ab24c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,106,226,187,200,104,10,127,25,193,91,1,237,181,207,63,42,178,76,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
