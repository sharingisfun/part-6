No more waiting for prints or plots from the Architect or Engineers. You are finished in a fraction of the time it used to take and your accuracy will improve using PlanSwift.\nWhat if the cost of materials or labor rates change? No problem, update a field in the software and reprint the report.\nHow is this possible? With PlanSwift takeoff software, you start by downloading the electronic blueprints directly from the planroom or practically any other digital plan right into the software. Then you immediately begin your calculations by pointing &amp; clicking on-screen! No digitizer needed (you can still use one with our software if you wish).\n* We also import almost any other file type: Excel, CAD file, a Plan file, a PDF, a JPG, etc.\n\n9.0.18.6 + Keygen\n\n9.5.15.8 Trial included.
