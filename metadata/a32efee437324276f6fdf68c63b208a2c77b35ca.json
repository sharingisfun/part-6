Singer/pianist Amy Lee cut such a figure fronting the group that it was easy to not think of Evanescence as a band, but rather a support group for her songs. After some lineup shifts, however, including the departure of founding member Ben Moody, the band consolidated and remained one of the most popular post-alternative American bands of the 2000s. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Whisper\n02.Call Me When You're Sober\n03.Bring Me To Life\n04.Lacrymosa\n05.Going Under\n06.Sweet Sacrifice\n07.My Immortal\n08.Missing\n09.Everybody's Fool\n10.Lithium\n11.Imaginary\n12.All That I'm Living For\n13.Tourniquet\n14.Away From Me\n15.Taking Over Me\n16.Lies\n17.Lose Control\n18.Before The Dawn\n19.Good Enough\n20.Heart Shaped Box\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Weight Of The World\n02.Haunted\n03.Where Will You Go\n04.My Last Breath\n05.Cloud Nine\n06.Hello\n07.Field Of Innocence\n08.Call Me When You're Sober (Acoustic Version)\n09.Thoughtless (Live)\n10.Farther Away (Live)\n11.Missing (Live)\n12.Your Star\n13.Even In Death\n14.Snow White Queen\n15.Like You\n16.The Only One\n17.Anywhere\n18.Wash It All Away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      ****Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n                                \n                                 ****Thanks****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32efee437324276f6fdf68c63b208a2c77b35ca","amp;dn":"Evanescence+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32efee437324276f6fdf68c63b208a2c77b35ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,46,254,228,55,50,66,118,246,253,246,140,99,178,8,162,199,123,53,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
