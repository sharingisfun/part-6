It has a ruthless authoritarian government. Many of us probably still have vivid memories of the tanks rolling over the bodies of the demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in 1989. It has a bad human rights record for the horrendous conditions of its working labor, and for its abuses against the Tibetans and the Uighur Muslim minority. It has also a record of supporting dictatorial regimes in other countries; such as, in Syria and North Korea.\n\nWe have 30 titles in this upload:\n\n-  Ashiwa &amp; Wank (Eds.) - Making Religion, Making the State; the Politics of Religion in Modern China (2009)\n\n-  Chan - Marketing Death; Culture and the Making of a Life Insurance Market in China (2012)\n\n-  Chang - Factory Girls; from Village to City in a Changing China (2008)\n\n-  Chang - Return of the Dragon; China's Wounded Nationalism (2001)\n\n-  Dikotter - MaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Great Famine; the History of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-1962 (2010)\n\n-  HRW - China's Forbidden Zones; Shutting the Media Out of Tibet and Other Sensitive Stories (2008)\n\n-  HRW - Devastating Blows; Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang (2005)\n\n-  HRW - I Saw It with My Own Eyes; Abuses by Chinese Security Forces in Tibet, 2008-2010 (2010)\n\n-  HRW - They Say We Should Be Grateful; Mass Rehousing and Relocation Programs in Tibetan Areas of China (2013)\n\n-  HRW - Walking on Thin Ice; Control, Intimidation and Harassment of Lawyers in China (2008)\n\n-  HRW - We Are Afraid to Even Look for Them; Enforced Disappearances in the Wake of Xinjiang's Protests (2009)\n\n-  Hui - The End of the Revolution; China and the Limit of Modernity (2009)\n\n-  Kerns - Who Will Shout If Not Us; Student Activists and the Tiananmen Square Protest, China, 1989 (2011)\n\n-  Kerr - Sky Burial; an Eyewitness Account of China's Crackdown in Tibet (1997)\n\n-  Landry - Decentralized Authoritarianism in China; the Communist Party's Control of Local Elites in the Post-Mao Era (2008)\n\n-  Lifton - Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism; a Study of Brainwashing in China (1989)\n\n-  Ling - A Heart for Freedom; the Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, Her Daring Escape,..
