This set's release in 1990 caused quite a stir, selling more than 500,000 copies, and, on the basis of endorsements from Eric Clapton and Keith Richards, introduced a great number of rock fans to Delta blues. Amazingly, Johnson built his enormous legacy on the strength of just two recording sessions: the first session, in November of 1936, produced among others &quot;I Believe I'll Dust My Broom,&quot; &quot;Sweet Home Chicago,&quot; &quot;Cross Road Blues,&quot; and &quot;Walkin' Blues,&quot; making it perhaps the most influential single session in blues history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65417c2555f7324be036eaee5195ce1f6f38135e","amp;dn":"Robert+Johnson+-+The+Complete+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65417c2555f7324be036eaee5195ce1f6f38135e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,65,124,37,85,247,50,75,224,54,234,238,81,149,206,31,111,56,19,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
