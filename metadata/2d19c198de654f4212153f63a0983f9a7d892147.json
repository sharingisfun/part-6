Includes the first ever piano versions of soundtrack themes for two of the most recent Hayao Miyazaki hit films, &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke.&quot; Also includes his other signature works such as &quot;Brother&quot; (from the Takeshi Kitano film), &quot;Quartet&quot; (from Joe Hisaishi's own directorial debut), and &quot;Summer&quot; widely heard in Japan through a Toyota commercial. It's an excellent album for both newbies and hardcore fans alike since the track selection suggests Hisaishi's best-of compilation, but at the same time, these tracks are all alternate versions.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.universal-music.co.jp/hisaishi/images/upch1142.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.universal-music.co.jp/hisaishi/images/upch1142.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
