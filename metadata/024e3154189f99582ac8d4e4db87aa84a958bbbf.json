He is now one of the most celebrated science fiction writers in the field , having won the field's top award, the Hugo, for each of his last two novels.\n\nNow, for the first time, this illustrious author gathers all his short fiction into a single volume. This collection is truly the definitive Vinge, capturing his visionary ideas at their very best. It also contains a never-before-published novella, one that represents precisely what this collection encapsulates--bold, unique, challenging science fictional ideas brought to vivid life with compelling storytelling.\n\nIncluding such major pieces as &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; and &quot;The Blabber,&quot; this sumptuous volume will satisfy any reader who loves the sense of wonder, and the excitement of great SF.\n\nThe volume collects Vinge's short fiction through 2001 (except &quot;True Names&quot;, including Vinge's comments from the earlier two volumes.)\n\nContents:\n&quot;Bookworm, Run!&quot;\n&quot;The Accomplice&quot;\n&quot;The Peddler's Apprentice&quot; (with Joan D.
