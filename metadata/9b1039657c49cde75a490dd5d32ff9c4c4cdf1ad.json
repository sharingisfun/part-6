The premise behind ObjectDock is very simple: it adds an animated, Mac-inspired dock to your desktop that provides easy access to useful shortcuts and serves to replace your taskbar (if you so choose).\n\nThe ObjectDock install is quick and light, and the program is extremely easy to set up. A simple settings menu lets you choose how many items you want on the dock, where it is positioned, and whether you want zoom enabled. You can also adjust the size, style, and color as well as set it to autohide or remain on top.\n\nWhat\\'s new in version 2.0\n\n    Icon reflections;\n    Background blur-behind (Vista/Win7 only);\n    Brand new User Interface and revamped menus;\n    Now displays all running programs in your dock, allowing for pinning &amp; unpinning (\\&quot;Show Applications\\&quot; mode);\n    For new users, automatically imports your quicklaunch icons (XP/Vista) or pinned taskbar icons (Windows 7) into your dock;\n    Mouseover effects previously only available in Plus now available in free version (Zoom, Swing and Glow, plus one brand new effect \\&quot;Bubble\\&quot;);\n    Ability to show minimized-windows-only in the dock;\n    Ability to have the dock always on top, but autohide when there is a maximized window (on by default);\n    New weather module with greatly increased reliability and built-in location search;\n    New true-stretch background drawing mode (among other tags) for improved skinnability;\n    New high-quality artist-prepared bundled backgrounds;\n    New icon-transparency setting, with new \\'ghost mode\\';\n    Drastically improved background browser.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nRun objectdockplus_200.exe\n\nTo Install Stardock ObjectDock Plus v2.0\n\nfollow The Onscreen Instructions By The Installer\n\nWhen Finish Installing, UnTick -&gt; [ Run ObjectDock Plus 2 Now ]\n\nAnd Click Finish To Exit The Setup, Now Extract The Keygen And Run It\n\nOn The Keygen Select [ Patch ] Select The [ CrashRpt.dll ] File And Select Open\n\nOnce Succesfully Patch, Select [ Save License ] And Click [ Save ]\n\nDone Enjoy !!! \n\n\n  \n~ Seed 4 others,Others would seed 4 u ~\n         Be a Gentleman!!\n\n    ______            ______   _______    \n   (  __  \\\\ |\\\\     /|(  __  \\\\ (  ____ \\\\   \n   | (  \\\\  )| )   ( || (  \\\\  )| (    \\\\/   \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (__       \n   | |   | || |   | || |   | ||  __)      \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (         \n _ | (__/  )| (___) || (__/  )| (____/\\\\ _ \n(_)(______/ (_______)(______/ (_______/(_)\n\n\nA simple THANKS goes a long way... :-)\nAny comments would b appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1039657c49cde75a490dd5d32ff9c4c4cdf1ad","amp;dn":"Stardock+ObjectDock+Plus+v2.0+Cracked+%5B.Dude.%5D.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1039657c49cde75a490dd5d32ff9c4c4cdf1ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,16,57,101,124,73,205,231,90,73,13,213,211,47,249,196,196,205,241,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
