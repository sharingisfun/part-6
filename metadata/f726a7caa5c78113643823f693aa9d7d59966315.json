The way it functions? Its ease of use? Or do factors like price and marketing dominate?\nIn a quest to find answers to these questions, Deconstructing Product Design engages readers in a process of critically analyzing a diverse collection of 100 innovative products, from well-known classics to contemporary objects of desire. The goal is to support critical thinking about design, facilitate discovery of patterns of success (and failure) across products, and enable readers to apply lessons learned to their own design work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f726a7caa5c78113643823f693aa9d7d59966315","amp;dn":"Deconstructing+Product+Design%3A100+Amazing+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f726a7caa5c78113643823f693aa9d7d59966315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,38,167,202,165,199,129,19,100,56,35,246,147,170,157,125,89,150,99,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
