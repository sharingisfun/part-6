Inspired by the heavy blues 68-72, this hard hitting band from Oslo, Norway is producing classic hard rock, heavy rock with a lot of blues. Mix it up with 2 spoonfuls of doom and psychedelia and you got Lonely Kamel. The band released the first (self-titled) full album in December 13th-2008. The second album is just finished recorded with Jo Schumann at Lydvingen Studios and now the psychedelic space rock monster Andreas Kirkevaag is set to mix the album. April 9th 2010 is the date for vinyl release of the self titled album.\n\nEarly days: Stian (bass) and Tumblin Thomas (vocals/guitar) started up Lonely Kamel summer 2005. Both being in love with different kind of music, wanted to start a band that could combine lots of genres that they loved. The late 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early seventies are of course their biggest influence with the heavy blues and psychedelia at that time. At the same time they were both listening a lot to the stoner rock scene with bands from Kyuss and Orange Goblin, to Brant Bjork and so on. They gathered some guys in a basement and just started playing everything from Pentagram covers to 30 minute long jam sessions spinning around 1 chord. After some jam sessions Thomas came along with 4 finished songs with lyrics and all (Damn YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Hot, Blindfolded, The Trip and Lonely Kamel, that later became the name of the band). After that Thomas has been writing a lot of songs, and he and Stian has developed them together playing all instruments at first. Later we formed a band that started up as Ben Johnson after the Canadian sprinter, but later became Lonely Kamel.\n\n2008 Lonely Kamel\n\n2010 Blues For The Dead\n\n2011 Dust Devil\n\n2014 Shit City                                   ..............................
