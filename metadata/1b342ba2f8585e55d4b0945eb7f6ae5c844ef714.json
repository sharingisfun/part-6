Because of the popularity of this program, the series now has grown to FIVE DVDs, over 5 1/2 hours of footage. Watchers 5 is the most ambitious of all, and its running time is 91 minutes! Watchers 5 also includes new reenactments of the real life stories our guests describe, and a chilling drama of the Black Eyed Children. These are not fictional dramas, but reenactments of actual events. It's not for the faint of heart. Watchers just wants to get to the bottom of the truth, and at times it may upset you. However, you won't find another series brave enough to tackle these topics. All in reference to ancient texts and the Bible.\n\nGary Stearman will never forget the clear, megaphone-like voice that rang in his ear as he flew his Cessna 207 from Dallas to Lubbock. That booming voice said, &quot;If you look to your left, you'll see a UFO! What happened soon thereafter is fresh in Gary's mind, even 30+ years later. His personal UFO encounter dramatically affected his world view and provides all the evidence you need to know that UFOs are real! Was his encounter with this enormous silver craft an angelic rescue from a potential mid-air disaster? Watchers 5 features Gary flying a vintage Stearman bi-plane, sharing the whole amazing story of that memorable day.\n\nThe Watchers series has reached new, extraordinary heights, presenting one thrilling segment after another. LA Marzulli and Richard Shaw's ongoing adventures continue with the story of black-eyed children who appear at hotels and car windows, even on boats at sea! They appear with a singular purposeÃ¢â‚¬â€they want to be invited in! Demons? Alien hybrids? Urban legends? Speaking of legends, our host interviews the leading expert on The Spear of Destiny, the weapon that pierced the side of Christ and supposedly gives its owner the power to rule the world. What significance does the word OBAMA have in the Bible codes, referencing the Gog and Magog war? And what secrets does the North Pole hold? Were Admiral Byrd and Adolf Hitler's suspicions right? Is the Hollow Earth theory credible? There's even moreÃ¢â‚¬â€the latest news from IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â€an interview with David Brennan, author of the Israel OmenÃ¢â‚¬â€Russian UFOs and new, laboratory revelations from alien implant physician, Dr. Leir. Yes, it's easily the best Watchers DVD yet!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b342ba2f8585e55d4b0945eb7f6ae5c844ef714","amp;dn":"The+Watchers+-+LA+Marzulli+-+Complete+DVD+1+thru+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b342ba2f8585e55d4b0945eb7f6ae5c844ef714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,52,43,162,248,88,94,85,212,176,148,94,183,246,174,92,132,78,247,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
