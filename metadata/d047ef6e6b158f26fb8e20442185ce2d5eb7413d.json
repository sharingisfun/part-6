In this workshop, professional developer Edward Tanguay teaches you object-oriented programming in a unique way. He introduces a real-world problem and shows two approaches to it, one object-oriented and one not. The non-object-oriented approach works at the beginning, but then you see as you progress along this path that adding features becomes increasingly difficult. Then he shows you the object-oriented approach, and you see how the structure of the code is different and how this allows you to add new features with ease. You'll also learn about new features of C # 4.0 such as the very welcome named and optional parameters as well as the fabulously simple new COM Interop feature to help you read and write Excel files from C #.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d047ef6e6b158f26fb8e20442185ce2d5eb7413d","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+Professional+C%23+Csharp+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d047ef6e6b158f26fb8e20442185ce2d5eb7413d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,71,239,110,107,21,143,38,251,142,32,68,33,133,206,45,94,183,65,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
