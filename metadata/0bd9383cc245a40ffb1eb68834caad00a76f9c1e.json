As the album sessions got under way, Bremner,\n Graham Parker's bass player Andrew Bodnar, and Paul Carrack (formerly of Squeeze, Ace and Roxy Music) played guitar,\n bass and piano respectively for the track &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;.\n\nFinally, Robbie McIntosh (guitar) and Malcolm Foster (bass) were recruited to join Hynde and Chambers, and the band\n was now officially a quartet. It was this line-up that recorded the majority of the tracks featured on\n Learning to Crawl.\n\nThe November 1983 single &quot;2000 Miles/Fast or Slow (The Law's the Law)&quot; was the newly reconstituted foursome's first release, followed shortly by the full Learning to Crawl album in January 1984.\n\n======================\n\nTracklist\n\nMiddle of the Road\t4:14\nBack On The Chain Gang\t3:48\nTime the Avenger\t4:56\nWatching the Clothes\t2:53\nShow Me\t4:16\nThumbelina\t3:18\nMy City Was Gone\t5:25\nThin Line Between Love &amp; Hate\t3:41\nThin Line Between Love and Hate\t3:19\nI Hurt You\t4:37\n2000 Miles\t3:46\n\n\nBonus:[16 Bit 96KHz]\n\nFast or Slow (The Law's the Law)\t3:15\nTequila\t3:36\nI Hurt You (Denmark Street demo)\t4:07\nWhen I Change My Life (Denmark Street demo)\t4:43\nRamblin' Rob (Denmark Street demo)\t3:32\nMy City Was Gone (live)\t4:54\nMoney (live)\t4:40\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.07 GB\nAlbum                                    : Learning To Crawl\nPerformer                                : Pretenders\nGenre                                    : Pop\nRecorded date                            : 2013\n\n=============================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 015 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd9383cc245a40ffb1eb68834caad00a76f9c1e","amp;dn":"The+Pretenders+-+Learning+To+Crawl+%281984%29+Flac%5BHDTracks+24Bit+96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd9383cc245a40ffb1eb68834caad00a76f9c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,217,56,60,194,69,164,15,251,30,182,136,52,202,173,0,167,111,156,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
