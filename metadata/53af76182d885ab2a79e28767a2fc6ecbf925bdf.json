Marie DeCuir arrives at a baroness's home deep in the Pyrenees Mountains for a weekend-long stay. \n\nThe journey is her first as an independent young woman, and she is determined to make the most of the unexpected invitation. At first, the cold and shadowy region unnerves her, however the Baroness is warm and welcoming, and the dinner is superb. \n\nBut who is the strange, beautiful woman at the table who makes Marie blush and falter? And what is the puzzling bond between the intriguing guest and the baroness?\n\nThere is a tension in the air, but Marie cannot make sense of what is going on - and it doesn't help that the baroness's other guests insist on discussing fairy tales. Rumours about monsters are for children and fools, while Marie is there to socialize and enjoy herself.\n\nMarie goes to bed with a spinning head - and soon wakes up to the sound of a frightening scream from somewhere in the castle. Thinking that the baroness is in danger, Marie goes to investigate - and quickly learns that the truth is stranger than she ever could have imagined.\n\nBecause among France's moonlit mountains, there are indeed beings who fear the light, and they know about your most secret desires...\n\nAn excerpt from the story:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“MarieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasies and the hot water were making her light-headed. Twirling the soap in her hands, she watched lather drip down on her chest and slowly run into the water. This was how her games with Anna often started.\n\nMarie would never admit openly that she enjoyed directing Anna even in mundane everyday tasks. She would never be so crude, but in secret, she enjoyed the thrill of knowing that she had authority. The candid idea was undignified and beneath her, but nevertheless exciting. Besides, fanciful thoughts never hurt anyone. \n\nLaughing softly to herself, Marie closed her eyes, leaned her head back against the porcelain, and enjoyed the sensation of the cold soap travelling down her skin. This was heaven.
