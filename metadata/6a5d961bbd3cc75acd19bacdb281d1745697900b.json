DJ Hype (aka Kevin Ford) is widely regarded as one of the greatest producers of drum 'n' bass music following his influential work with London radio station Kiss 100, pirate station Fantasy FM and international club appearances. DJ Hype Presents Drum + Bass Essentials finds the London-based producer mixing some of the finest club anthems of recent times. \n\nThe exuberant 'Crash Test' by Cause 4 Concern is a notable early highlight, with their distinctive vinyl sound generously given additional life by the new mix, whilst the synthetic-heavy breakbeat of 'All That Jazz' by DJ Fresh still sounds as exciting now as it did back in it's original single release in 2006. The album briefly steps into a dubstep vibe for an inventive mix of 'Wicked So' by Chase &amp; Status (featuring Kano) before 'Mr Happy', a dance floor hit by the much in-demand DJ Hazard. Delving into darker territory with much heavier bass lines, this sound is continued later with 'Fools' by Dirty Harry - DJ Hazard's alias. The atmospheric 'Shiners', by long-term drum 'n' bass cult hero Dillinja is another worthy addition, whilst arguably the finest moment is saved until the end with a glorious remix of Pendulum's riff-heavy, snappy hit single, 'Showdown'. \n\nDJ Hype's monumental talent as a DJ and producer has never been questioned, but to sustain this level of energy and excitement over 56 tracks is genuinely breathtaking. Evidently in his element with choice cuts from some of the biggest names in drum 'n' bass at his disposal, Drum + Bass Essentials moves DJ Hype even closer to legendary status.\n\nDisc: 1  \n\n1.
