Norah is sick of being the doormat for her catty friend Tris, so rather than look like she's arrived at yet another concert without her unreliable ex-boyfriend-with-benefits Tal, she grabs a stranger and pretends he's her date. Unfortunately, that stranger is Nick -- whom Tris just dumped. Oddly enough, though, Nick and Norah seem to have a real connection. But is Nick still too hung up on the princess? The only way to find out is to spend all night combing Manhattan in a yellow Yugo.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 30 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150d3af402847616863efdf8e5ae0097ac652c87","amp;dn":"Nick+and+Norah%5C%27s+Infinite+Playlist%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150d3af402847616863efdf8e5ae0097ac652c87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,13,58,244,2,132,118,22,134,62,253,248,229,174,0,151,172,101,44,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
