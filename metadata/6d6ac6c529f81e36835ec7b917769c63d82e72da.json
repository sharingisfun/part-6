Created in the throes of '60s and '70s counterculture and frequently political in nature, the strip has consistently helped to steer America's national conversation by commenting on it, provoking it, and sometimes even being the subject of it. \n\nThis torrent collects the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip from its premiere in 1970 through the end of 2014 in a set of CBR files, one for each year. An additional CBR file collects Trudeau's &quot;Bull Tales&quot; comic strip, which ran in the Yale Daily News from 1968 to 1970, and which was a direct predecessor to &quot;Doonesbury.&quot;\n\nMost of the strips through the late '90s were obtained from an anonymously-uploaded torrent file which unfortunately no longer seems to be seeded and which I could download only incompletely. Later strips I downloaded myself from the gocomics.com Web site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6ac6c529f81e36835ec7b917769c63d82e72da","amp;dn":"Doonesbury+-+1970+through+2014+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6ac6c529f81e36835ec7b917769c63d82e72da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,106,198,197,41,248,30,54,131,94,199,185,23,118,156,99,216,46,114,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
