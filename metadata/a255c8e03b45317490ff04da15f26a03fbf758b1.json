Based on a real-life New Yorker article, the movie repelled those who saw it, and it bombed at the box office.\n\nMany decades later, this strange, antiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“American Dream film is a cult classic. Ed Avery (James Mason) plays a downtrodden, underpaid high-school teacher resigned to his dull life and his inflamed arteries. Then he takes the &quot;miracle drug&quot; cortisone and turns into a Nietzschean monster.\n\nHe sneers at his students, mocks the stupidity of his bourgeois wife (Barbara Rush), and bullies and threatens his son (Christopher Olsen), going so far as to have visions of Abraham sacrificing Isaac.
