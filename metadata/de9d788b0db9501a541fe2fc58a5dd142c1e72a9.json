The guys go on to talk about John Walsh, bullshit stats, the awful subways, outrage by country, they swap homeless encounter and early scary city stories, Ant and Joe reminisce on old stories, and they discuss high school dropouts. The day wraps with plenty more stories of being young, dumb, and full of cum, we learn about a naughty dentist, check out Yulia Kaunovaâ€™s Tumblr, go through some pics of Angela Sarafyan, and see the latest from Eugenia Cooney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: I wrote a single tool that rips anything off of cumia's site(even if Zype were to use their TEA based stream encryption), Sirius app protocol, and Artie Lange's Uncensored podcast. This means I can also get anything off Stern 100-101 etc..\r\n\r\nI only seed for 5 hours after upload so if you download&amp;delete you only f**k yourselves. If you want me to be like wushdishmeen or mothergoose or fatherburns(all dead) who did it daily and kept the original seed up, then I need bitcoin donations to cover the hours a month I spend processing things; since I can't sale advertising etc..\r\n\r\n\r\nI only expect change.. Hell pennies per person even which is like thousands of satoshis.. 1/450 of the cheapest monthly subscription cost of those.\r\n\r\nSend any bitcoin donations to: 1AFiKbmRUyagA2Su812YFwtap4w2w5npdE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de9d788b0db9501a541fe2fc58a5dd142c1e72a9","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+10-12-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de9d788b0db9501a541fe2fc58a5dd142c1e72a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,157,120,139,13,185,80,26,84,31,226,252,88,165,221,20,44,30,114,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
