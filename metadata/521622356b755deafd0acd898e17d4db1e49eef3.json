Unlike illuminated Passover manuscripts from the same period with their rich figurative and narrative picture cycles, Bibles are almost exclusively aniconic. Whereas the former borrow heavily from Christian art, the Bibles are entirely indebted to Islamic culture. The volume elaborates in particular on the cultural history of the decorative motifs and types of ornamentation in an era of cultural transition in Iberia and culture struggle within Spanish Jewry. The first two chapters describe the cultural, social and artistic background in which the Bibles were produced, whereas the other chapters describe the works of the different schools and discuss them within different cultural, historical and social contexts. The text is accompanied by 10 color plates and 141 black-and-white figures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:521622356b755deafd0acd898e17d4db1e49eef3","amp;dn":"Jewish+Book+Art+Between+Islam+and+Christianity+-+The+Decoration+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"521622356b755deafd0acd898e17d4db1e49eef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,22,34,53,107,117,93,234,253,10,205,137,142,23,212,219,30,73,238,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
