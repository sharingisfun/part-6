Lace-knitter Andrea Jurgrau shows how she creates her patterns, lifting or creating and adjusting individual motifs, then reworking and combining them into original, unique works of wearable art.\n\nTake knitted doilies to another level! Intricate, delicate, and from the past, Andrea readily acknowledges that you might not have a use for such items. In her book New Vintage Lace, you'll find a collection of 18 fully-charted projects that she has altered and adapted into fresh wearable accessories suited to more modern styles and tastes.\n\nAndrea shows you many particulars of lace knitting - explaining special stitches, how to read both charts and your own knitting, different ways of adding beads, and the importance of proper blocking. New Vintage Lace will take you beyond the current trends and leave you wanting more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbdf7713ece001d49460e384147931b4f1e69401","amp;dn":"New+Vintage+Lace+-+Knits+Inspired+By+The+Past","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbdf7713ece001d49460e384147931b4f1e69401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,223,119,19,236,224,1,212,148,96,227,132,20,121,49,180,241,230,148,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
