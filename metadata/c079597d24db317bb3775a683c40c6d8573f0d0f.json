She wrote her own songs, was extremely photogenic and her only real rival was the meagerly talented Tiffany. Debbie eventually won the Pop duel of the '80s and released memorable hit records. When she outgrew her teen audience (and they outgrew her), she became Deborah Gibson and pursued a successful career on Broadway with the occasional foray into the studio. Features 12 tracks including remixes of 'Only In My Dreams', 'Shake Your Love' and 'Losin' Myself'. Warner.\n\nAll Music - Say what you will about the slickly produced teen pop of the late '80s and its revival in the late '90s: Debbie Gibson made some of the best of either era. Her best material (nearly all of which she wrote herself) displayed superior pop craftsmanship at a surprisingly young age, and she was no slouch as a producer or arranger, either. Perhaps that's why Greatest Hits still sounds so much less calculated and contrived than a lot of the artists working similar territory. Rant and rave all you want about corporate pandering; Gibson's love of pure pop is obvious (so it shouldn't be a surprise that she later moved into musicals). Yes, this music is almost painfully clean-cut and sugary-sweet, but Gibson imbues it with a refreshing sincerity which comes directly from the fact that this is her music (unlike teen queens who rely on middle-aged men for material). Greatest Hits features all of her hit singles, and while both the upbeat dance-pop and the adult contemporary ballads sound very much of their time, that's not a bad thing at all -- they're very good, very well-crafted pop songs, and they hold up surprisingly well because of that.
