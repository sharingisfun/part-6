The group also included fellow Down Under rockers Jimmy Barnes and Glenn Shorrock.\n\nIn 1996, writer Peter Head and Sydney musician Ted Yanni started work on the cut, which included ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal track. The pair began assembling musicians to pull together a new backing track. \n\nOther pre-AC/DC songs by Scott (who passed away after a long night of boozing in 1980) have surfaced in the past, and maybe more stuff will appear in time.  I can only say its for the die hard Bon Scott fan! \nIt only contains 4 tracks\nRound and round and round - 3:22\nNot bad, pretty good rockin song!\nCarey Gully - 2:53\nSofter type of slow number for Bon that no AC/DC fan would be used to hearing from him! It is quite uniuqe!\nRound &amp; Round - 2:45\nSeems to be an alternate version of the first track, just without the heavery guitars, its kind of a light poppish version of the same song!\nTo know you is to love you - 2:57\nI think this is just an alternate version of the 2nd track too! Its another slow version, balled type of romantic side from Bon!\nOverall - I have to say, only the die hard fan begging to hear the legend Bon Scott sing somthing they havent heard will want to pay the price for this album with only 4 tracks!\nThis is not AC/DC, it is not Fraternity, and it is not The Spekters. Its just 2 songs, and two alternate versions of the same song. So be the judge for yourself if you want to purchase this or not?\n\n You don't?\n\nWell that's great, cause I give everything away!\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Round and round and round - 3:22\n\n2 Carey Gully - 2:53 \n\n3 Round &amp; Round - 2:45\n\n4 To know you is to love you - 2:57\n\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band. Not to the DMCA\nBut in this case it different the artist has been dead for 35 years so money is not a pressing need anymore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf40c0c8a51971501296a85ae6ec154c1f54afb","amp;dn":"Bon+Scott+-+Round+and+Round++2011+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf40c0c8a51971501296a85ae6ec154c1f54afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,244,12,12,138,81,151,21,1,41,106,133,174,110,193,84,193,245,74,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
