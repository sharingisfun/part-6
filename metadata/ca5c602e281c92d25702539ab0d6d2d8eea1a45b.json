Recruit a crew, outfit and customize your ship and set sail on the open seas. There youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use any combination of aggression, diversion and trade to become the most infamous pirate crew of the seven seas! You can raid, pillage and plunder everything in your path, divert and lie to get what you want or trade for a quick buck. Remember to be careful though, death is everywhere and quite permanent! Adventure awaitsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nThis is Pixel Piracy 4.8.0 I am very new to this so I would love constructive criticism. Small file because I deleted the _CommonRedist folder.
