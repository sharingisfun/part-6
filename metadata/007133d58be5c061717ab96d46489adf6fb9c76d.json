Less sonically brutal than 2011's Mastermind, yet still seismic enough to bear the weight of the Monster Magnet moniker, Dave Wyndorf and company have crafted another late-period gem that sounds like an amalgam of the 13th Floor Elevators, Mark Lanegan, Ten Years After, and Mastodon. &quot;I Live Behind the Clouds&quot; (&quot;Nothing's important, yet everything is/If there ain't no photo, I just don't exist&quot;) starts things out on a heady note, easing into the action like a snake poking its head of its den, before lunging into the desert proper on the dusty title cut, a nine-minute epic that slithers its way into your skull and sets up camp. A Sabbath-smacked take on Donovan's Middle Eastern-tinged &quot;Three Kingfishers&quot; shows the band's musical versatility hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lost a beat over the years, as does the bongo and synth-driven &quot;The Duke of Supernature,&quot; a sleazy tale of sex and dark magic that wouldn't sound out of place on a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club LP. Last Patrol ties things up nicely with the one-two punch of &quot;Strobe Light Beatdown&quot; and &quot;One Dead Moon,&quot; the former a blistering garage rock rager and the latter a midnight power ballad that shakes its fist at the inky blue and then disappears into its gaping maw.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zRW2Ld1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zRW2Ld1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007133d58be5c061717ab96d46489adf6fb9c76d","amp;dn":"Monster+Magnet+-+Last+Patrol+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007133d58be5c061717ab96d46489adf6fb9c76d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,113,51,213,139,229,192,97,113,122,185,109,70,72,154,223,111,185,199,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
