It is set up to run on an OFW PS3 with the 3K3y in decrypted ISO format but it will run with CFW as well with or without the 3K3y. It might need some tweaking if you want to run it on CFW. This emulator lets you save like you would normally on the original console. If you want to add or delete games from this ISO, just extract with WinRAR, go into  PS3_GAME/USRDIR/, add or delete the roms and create ISO with ISO Tools. Just make sure output is decrypted ISO for OFW and encrypted ISO for CFW.\n\nTo load rom, go down to dvd_bdvd/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/ then click &quot;X&quot; to load the rom. It comes with 236 of the most popular games for the system including: \n\nCastlevania: Dracula X\nChrono Trigger\nDonkey Kong Country\nDonkey Kong Country 2\nDonkey Kong Country 3\nEarthworm Jim\nEarthworm Jim 2\nFinal Fantasy I\nFinal Fantasy II\nFinal Fantasy III\nFinal Fantasy IV\nKiller Instinct\nLegend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past\nMega Man X\nMega Man X 2\nMega Man X 3 \nMortal Kombat\nMortal Kombat 2\nMortal Kombat 3\nNBA Jam\nSecret Of Mana\nSuper Castlevania IV\nSuper Mario All-Stars\nSuper Mario Kart\nSuper Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars\nSuper Mario World\nSuper Metroid\nStar Fox","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd7e15b2c434a1e7a5728569afa35d7c14b01a0c","amp;dn":"%5BSNES+9x+Emulator%5D%5BPS3%5D%5B3K3y%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd7e15b2c434a1e7a5728569afa35d7c14b01a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,126,21,178,196,52,161,231,165,114,133,105,175,163,93,124,20,176,26,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
