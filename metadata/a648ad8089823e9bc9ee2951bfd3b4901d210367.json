Udemy at it's heart is a search engine running on top of a marketplace, and so it HAS to have a way of ordering courses from 1 to 20000 in the order that makes the most sense for what the student is searching for at the time. SEO absolutely can work on Udemy, you just need to know a few things about how it works.\n\nThere are not many sources to explain how it works, and not much research into it. Udemy themselves do not explain how search works. But we can derive some SEO conclusions, both from what we see when we do searches, and from experience working behind the scenes with other search engines.\n\nKnowing Google SEO will only help a little. Udemy's search engine is not as sophisticated as Google's. And there are very limited ways we can modify our course.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How Udemy search works\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Difference between Google search and Udemy search\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to decide what keywords to target\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Competitive analysis\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to get ranked in Udemy search using SEO\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to get ranked in Google search using SEO\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Testing changes\n\nWhat are the requirements?\n\nYou should have a course in mind to create or have a course already live\nKnow who your target students are\nKnow what words (keywords) those students might use to search for your course\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\n\nOver 33 lectures and 2.5 hours of content!\nUnderstand how the Udemy search engine works\nKnow how to choose a URL for your course\nKnow how long and what words to use in your title\nKnow how many times to use your keywords in your course description\nUnderstand the difference between Google Search and Udemy search\nWhat is the target audience?\n\nPeople with courses on Udemy\nPeople who want to understand how Udemy search determines top results\nInstructors researching their potential course","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a648ad8089823e9bc9ee2951bfd3b4901d210367","amp;dn":"Udemy+-+SEO+For+Udemy+-+Scott+Duffy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a648ad8089823e9bc9ee2951bfd3b4901d210367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,72,173,128,137,130,62,155,201,238,41,81,191,211,180,144,29,33,3,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
