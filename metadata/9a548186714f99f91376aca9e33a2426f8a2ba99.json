While as unified and insightful as Blue, the album -- a concept record exploring the roles of honesty and trust in relationships, romantic and otherwise -- moves away from confessional songwriting into evocative character studies: the hit &quot;Free Man in Paris,&quot; written about David Geffen, is a not-so-subtle dig at the machinations of the music industry, while &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot; offers an acutely funny look at the predatory environment of the singles bar scene. Much of Court and Spark is devoted to wary love songs: both the title cut and &quot;Help Me,&quot; the record&amp;#039;s most successful single, carefully measure the risks of romance, while &quot;People&amp;#039;s Parties&quot; and &quot;The Same Situation&quot; are fraught with worry and self-doubt (standing in direct opposition to the music, which is smart, smooth, and assured from the first note to the last).\n\n256 kbit/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a548186714f99f91376aca9e33a2426f8a2ba99","amp;dn":"Joni+Mitchell+-++Court+and+Spark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a548186714f99f91376aca9e33a2426f8a2ba99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,84,129,134,113,79,153,249,19,118,172,169,227,58,36,38,248,162,186,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
