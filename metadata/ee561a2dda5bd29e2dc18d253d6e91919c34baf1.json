Throughout the book, plenty of real-world examples demonstrate the countless possibilities of creating one-of-a-kind molecules and supramolecular systems to support a broad range of applications. The book explores applications in both materials and bioorganic chemistry, including molecular electronics, energy storage, sensors, nanomedicine, and enzyme engineering.\n\nOrganic Synthesis and Molecular Engineering consists of fourteen chapters, each one contributed by one or more leading international experts in the field. The contributions are based on a thorough review and analysis of the current literature as well as the authors' firsthand experience in the lab engineering new organic molecules. Designed as a practical lab reference, the book offers:\n\nTested and proven synthetic approaches to organic materials chemistry\nMethods and practices to successfully engineer functionality into organic molecules\nExplanations of the principles and concepts underlying self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry\nGuidance in selecting appropriate structural units used in the design and synthesis of functional molecules and materials\nCoverage of the full range of applications in materials and bioorganic chemistry\nA full chapter on graphene, a new topic generating intense research\n\n\nOrganic Synthesis and Molecular Engineering begins with core concepts, molecular building blocks, and synthetic tools. Next, it explores molecular electronics, supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly, graphene, and photoresponsive materials engineering. In short, it offers everything researchers need to fully grasp the underlying theory and then build new molecules and supramolecular systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee561a2dda5bd29e2dc18d253d6e91919c34baf1","amp;dn":"Organic+Synthesis+and+Molecular+Engineering-+Wiley+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee561a2dda5bd29e2dc18d253d6e91919c34baf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,86,26,45,218,91,210,158,45,193,141,37,61,110,145,145,156,52,186,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
