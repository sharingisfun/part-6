Not only do we learn about such events as the Battle of LA and early military coverups, but interesting phenomena like RODs and invisible UFOs only detectable with infra red cameras. An amazing daylight video is shown demonstrating the detection of a UFO in infra red mode. \n\nAlthough many viewers have seen the 2001 Disclosure Project Press Conference, featured in this movie is a compressed Disclosure Project segment outlining some of the notable highlights from this event. This is an excellent way to present the Disclosure Project to people without having to sit them through the entire 2 hour press conference. For example, Disclosure Project witness, Clifford Stone, is featured as he discussed the fact that there have been multiple extraterrestrial crashes he was personally involved in. \n\nThe momentum from the Preview trailers is clearly evident throughout the movie. One might say that most of the movie played out just like the trailers themselves. This isn&amp;#039;t necessarily a bad thing, however the cinematic bombardment of music &amp; flow to the sequences can be a little much. \n\n\nRun Time: 94 minutes\n\n\nFor more information on the film or to purchase this video on DVD, please visit the official website at:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5295e16bc94b3d7dd9c678cdd6f8115ecd9ae7","amp;dn":"UFO+The+Greatest+Story+Ever+Denied+%5BAVI+-+2006+-+Aliens+-+NWO+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5295e16bc94b3d7dd9c678cdd6f8115ecd9ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,82,149,225,107,201,75,61,125,217,198,120,205,214,248,17,94,205,154,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
