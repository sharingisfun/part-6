Murphy is John Dolittle, who this time around attempts to save an endangered Pacific forest from lumber industry forces by reintegrating an endangered species of bear back into the wild. Unfortunately, Dolittle's candidate is a performing bear (voice of Steve Zahn) with a taste for junk food and no natural skills in the wild. If Dolittle is going to save the species and its habitat, he must get him to mate with a fussy female (Lisa Kudrow) by providing lessons in winning the heart of the opposite sex. Dr. Dolittle's problems are compounded by a local animal work stoppage and furry woodland creatures who have organized their own version of the Mafia. Norm Macdonald returns as the voice of Lucky the Dog, co-starring with Kevin Pollak, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Rapaport, Molly Shannon, Reni Santoni, and Kristen Wilson.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 27 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2099de46718a2d8713e48bd1e835dfc3b0447d","amp;dn":"Dr.+Dolittle+2%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2099de46718a2d8713e48bd1e835dfc3b0447d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,32,153,222,70,113,138,45,135,19,228,139,209,232,53,223,195,176,68,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
