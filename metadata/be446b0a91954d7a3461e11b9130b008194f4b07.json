After failing to attract a following from the major cities, he's now deeply in debt, but refuses to advertise or cater to the local community. Ken's daughter calls in Chef Robert Irvine, hoping that the fellow Brit can help her stubborn father see how much help his business really needs.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be446b0a91954d7a3461e11b9130b008194f4b07","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Impossible.S11E03.Chocolate.Impossible.WS.DSR.x264-NY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be446b0a91954d7a3461e11b9130b008194f4b07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,68,107,10,145,149,77,122,52,97,225,27,145,48,176,8,25,79,75,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
