These are new HD scans so the file sizes are large but the quality is high. All credit to the amazing scanners, Minutemen-Morningstar on #1-13 and HALO-Novus on the final 2 issues!\n\nI hardly ever write this, but this is definitely an adults-only series.\n\nPlease seed and share with our friends on TPB.  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nFaust is the collective name of several series of comic books by Tim Vigil (art) and David Quinn (stories), published by Rebel Studios and Avatar Press.\n\nThe series are known for their strong graphic violence and sexual situations. The main series is known as Faust: Love of the Damned and began in 1987, with new issues being published irregularly. The gap between issues grew wider with time: issue 11 was published in 1995; issue 12 in 2001; issue 13 in 2005; it then took seven years for the authors to deliver the two last issues, 14 and 15, which concluded the story 25 years after the first issue.\n\nThe original comic book series was adapted for the big screen by Brian Yuzna in 2000, as Faust: Love of the Damned.\n\n------\n\nFrom Ain't It Cool News in May 2012:\n\nDavid Quinn: &quot;[...] 25 years since the first book came out in 1987 on an unsuspecting comics market, the marketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changed a lot. In some ways a lot of adult books have caught up with FAUST. A lot of self published ... well I say &quot;caught up,&quot; but you know ... a lot of self published and creator owned publishing has gone on, which echoes the sort of feeling there was out there in 1987 when a lot of people were doing it. There are a lot of darker comics these days, which sort of all have their initial rumblings and some of the things that were out in the mid 80's like DARK KNIGHT, WATCHMEN, CROW, and FAUST which all hit around 1986 and 1987. So 25 years later and we are finally putting out our last two chapters.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af671b357c57dde4b0c1f08b46ee2cf2e72312c8","amp;dn":"FAUST+-+LOVE+OF+THE+DAMNED+01-15+%281987-2013%29+Complete+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af671b357c57dde4b0c1f08b46ee2cf2e72312c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,103,27,53,124,87,221,228,176,193,240,139,70,238,44,242,231,35,18,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
