His first two collections of essays Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Essays: First Series and Essays: Second Series, published respectively in 1841 and 1844 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ represent the core of his thinking, and include such well-known essays as Self-Reliance, The Over-Soul, Circles, The Poet and Experience. Together with Nature, these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson's most fertile period.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6ae4d031f33ba5fe9cc60affafa11d272126f4","amp;dn":"Essays+by+Ralph+Waldo+Emerson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6ae4d031f33ba5fe9cc60affafa11d272126f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,106,228,208,49,243,59,165,254,156,198,10,255,175,161,29,39,33,38,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
