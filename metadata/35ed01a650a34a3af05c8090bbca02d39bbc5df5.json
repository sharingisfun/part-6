I cannot, now, at distance, see it otherwise.\n\nThe first plan for Canto dates from the early seventies. It originated almost secretly, clandestinely, along with other activities.\n\nThe following years witnessed the restoration of tonality after tonalityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death\n\nCanto ostinato for keyboard instruments was completed in 1976, was tonal, and perhaps, as an unruly phenomenon, needed three years of reconcilement.\n\nThe assumption of the-longer-the better is a mistake if the tension between two moments in time fails and what sounds is nothing more than pointless repetition of the same.\n\nMusic, contrary to language, is not a means of expression ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ something but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ something\n\nThe feeling of hardly having anything to say was never as strong as with Canto ostinato. At first, I watched the piece unfold with the utmost suspicion. This was not done, really: tonality, this open, this plain, this explicit.\n\nThe question if Canto would be minimal music, look, if people want to label it like that, why not? You cannot do much about it.\n\nThe first performance took place on April 25th 1979 in the RuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯nekerk in Bergen\n\nAlthough, inprinciple and as it should be in a developmental structure, every part of Canto has a certain place in the progression and is not exchangeable without violating melodic line, logic and form, beginning and ending are not of final significance as limitations of form\n\nTime plays an important role/part?\n\nTime becomes the space in which the musical object comes afloat.\n\nThere is a considerable margin for input from the performers.\n\nPerformances can be considered as rituals, rather than concerts\n\nLet us assume that the piece is played by one performer (i.e. a pianist)...\n\t\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ed01a650a34a3af05c8090bbca02d39bbc5df5","amp;dn":"simeon+ten+holt+-+canto+ostinato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ed01a650a34a3af05c8090bbca02d39bbc5df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,237,1,166,80,163,74,58,240,92,128,144,187,202,2,211,155,188,93,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
