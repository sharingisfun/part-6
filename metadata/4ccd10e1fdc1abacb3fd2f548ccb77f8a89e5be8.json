They leave no stone unturned as sporting events, restaurants, art galleries, and traditional pheasant hunts turn into lurid displays of bad manners and profiteering. Things climax at the social event of the season, the inaugural voyage of the new pleasure cruiser The Magic Christian. \n\nThe Magic Christian is a 1969 British comedy film directed by Joseph McGrath and starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr, with noteworthy appearances by John Cleese, Raquel Welch, Christopher Lee, Richard Attenborough and Roman Polanski.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ccd10e1fdc1abacb3fd2f548ccb77f8a89e5be8","amp;dn":"The+Magic+Christian+%5B1969%5D+DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ccd10e1fdc1abacb3fd2f548ccb77f8a89e5be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,205,16,225,253,193,171,172,179,253,47,84,140,203,119,248,168,158,91,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
