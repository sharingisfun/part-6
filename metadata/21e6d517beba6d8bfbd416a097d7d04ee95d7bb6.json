And it would appear that they were expecting him. As he returns home, bringing an entourage of strangers with him, he starts to wonder whether his discovery has been such a good thing. For the gods of this lost race are the gods of war, and their memories of that far-off cataclysm have not faded.\n\nThe people of Fellein have live with legends for many centuries. To their far north, the Blasted Lands, a legacy of an ancient time of cataclysm, are vast, desolate and impassable, but that doesn't stop the occasional expedition into their fringes in search of any trace of the ancients who had once lived there... and oft-rumored riches.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e6d517beba6d8bfbd416a097d7d04ee95d7bb6","amp;dn":"Seven+Forges+-+James+A.+Moore+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e6d517beba6d8bfbd416a097d7d04ee95d7bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,230,213,23,190,186,109,139,251,212,22,160,151,215,208,78,233,93,123,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
