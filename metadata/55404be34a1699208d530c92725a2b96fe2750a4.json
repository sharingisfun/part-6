Daniels (August 1st 2012) \n\nKit ColbanaÃ¢â‚¬â€half breed, assassin, thief, jack of all tradesÃ¢â‚¬â€has a new job: track down the missing ward of one of the local alpha shapeshifters. It should be a piece of cake.\n\nSo why is she so nervous? It probably has something to do with the insanity that happens when you deal with shiftersÃ¢â‚¬â€especially sexy ones who come bearing promises of easy jobs and easier money.\n\nOr maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all the other missing kids that Kit discovers while working the case, or the way her gut keeps screaming sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotten in over her head. Or maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because if she failsÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dead.\n\nIf she can stay just one step ahead, she should be okay. Maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even live long to collect her feeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nNight Blade (Colbana Files #2) by J.C. Daniels (March 4th 2013) \n\nKit Colbana is always biting off more than she can chew. She has a knack for finding trouble. This time, though, trouble finds her. Someone from her past drops a case into her lap that she just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦literally.\n\nPeople on the Council are dying left and right and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been requested to investigate the deaths. The number one suspect? Her lover, Damon. If she doesn't clear his name, he gets a death sentence. Even if she succeeds? They still might try to execute him. Oh, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not allowed to tell him about the case, either.\n\nThe stakes are high this time around, higher than they've ever been. Kit may be forced to pay the ultimate price to save her loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a price that could destroy her and everything she loves. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55404be34a1699208d530c92725a2b96fe2750a4","amp;dn":"Colbana+Files+Series+%281-2%29+by+J.C.+Daniels+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55404be34a1699208d530c92725a2b96fe2750a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,64,75,227,74,22,153,32,141,83,12,146,114,90,43,150,254,39,80,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
