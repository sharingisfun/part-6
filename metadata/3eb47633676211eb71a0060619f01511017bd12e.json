The first series takes a look at the often overlooked, early political relationships as well as Henry's trysts with such notable women as Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn.\n\nThe second series looks at King Henry's struggle with the Pope over his divorce, and his marriage to Anne Boleyn as well as the creation of the Church of England.\n\n\nThe third series focuses on the people's response to the creation of a new national Church and on the king's third and fourth marriage.\n\nThe series is shot on location in Ireland. Michael Hirst, writer of the Oscar-winning movie Elizabeth, is the series creator, writer and executive producer. This series is an excellent example of good history to film adaption equal to that of HBO's Rome.\n\n\nEnjoy and as always Please Seed because if you don't seed than you should DL!\n\n\n\n\n(DL_King)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb47633676211eb71a0060619f01511017bd12e","amp;dn":"The+Tudors+Complete+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3+%28DL_King%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb47633676211eb71a0060619f01511017bd12e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,180,118,51,103,98,17,235,113,160,6,6,25,240,21,17,1,123,209,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
