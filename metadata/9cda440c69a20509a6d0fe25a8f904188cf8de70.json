But such rhetoric threatens to obscure the humanism and generosity of his art. The five films included here represent his self-financed works made outside the studio system of Hollywood, on which he was afforded complete control. Populated by beatniks, hippies, businessmen, actors, housewives, strippers, club owners, gangsters, and children, the films are beautiful, emotional testaments to compassion. Cassavetes has often been called an actorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s director, but this body of workÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even greater than the sum of its extraordinarily significant partsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½reveals him to be an audienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s director. The Criterion Collection is proud to present Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under the Influence, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, and Opening Night in stunning new transfers.\n\nSHADOWS\nJohn Cassavetes 1959\nJohn CassavetesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ directorial debut revolves around an interracial romance between Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), a light-skinned black woman living in New York City with her two brothers, and Tony (Anthony Ray), a white man. Shadows is a visionary work and the forerunner of the independent film movement.\n\nFACES\nJohn Cassavetes 1968\nThe disintegration of a marriage is dissected in John CassavetesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ searing Faces. Shot in high-contrast 16 mm black and white, the film follows the futile attempts of a captain of industry (John Marley) and his wife (Lynn Carlin) to escape the anguish of their empty marriage in the arms of others.\n\nA WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE\nJohn Cassavetes 1974\nJohn CassavetesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ devastating drama details the emotional breakdown of a suburban housewife and her familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s struggle to save her from herself. This is one of the benchmark films of American independent cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a heroic document from a true maverick director.\n\nTHE KILLING OF A CHINESE BOOKIE\nJohn Cassavetes 1976\nJohn Cassavetes engages film noir in his own inimitable style. Ben Gazzara brilliantly portrays gentlemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s club owner Cosmo Vitelli, a man dedicated to pretenses of composure and self-possession. When he runs afoul of a group of gangsters, Cosmo is forced to commit a horrible crime.\n\nOPENING NIGHT\nJohn Cassavetes 1976\nIn John CassavetesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Opening Night, Broadway actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) rehearses for her latest play, about a woman unable to admit that she is aging. When she witnesses the accidental death of an adoring young fan, she begins to confront the turmoil she faces in her own life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cda440c69a20509a6d0fe25a8f904188cf8de70","amp;dn":"John+Cassavetes+-+5+Films+%28Criterion+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cda440c69a20509a6d0fe25a8f904188cf8de70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,218,68,12,105,162,5,9,166,208,254,37,168,249,4,24,140,248,222,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
