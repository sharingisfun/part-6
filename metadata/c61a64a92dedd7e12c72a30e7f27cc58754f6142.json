Much of that progress has a direct bearing on signal processing. In particular, the nonlinear\nnature of neural networks, the ability of neural networks to learn from their environments in\nsupervised as well as unsupervised ways, as well as the universal approximation property of neural\nnetworks make them highly suited for solving difficult signal processing problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61a64a92dedd7e12c72a30e7f27cc58754f6142","amp;dn":"Artificial+Neural+Networks%28Big+collection%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61a64a92dedd7e12c72a30e7f27cc58754f6142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,26,100,169,45,237,215,225,44,114,163,14,127,39,204,88,117,79,97,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
