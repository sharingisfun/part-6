But thoroughly researched, unbiased reviews are hard to come by. That is why Consumer Reports has been a mainstay in buying guides since 1936, keeping readers informed on the best products, from cars to tools and appliances. Each issue offers useful and detailed reviews that are broken down into dozens of categories, such as electronics, home and yard, fitness and cars. Sections are then further broken down into subcategories, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“best in fuel economyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for cars, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“best TV brandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for electronics.\n\n\nConsumer Reports Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New Car Preview 2014 (Special Issue)\nBook Language: English \nPages: 204\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 32.87 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JpTSLyd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JpTSLyd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7df415cc2a254fba05886ef51241ae3937bcaeb0","amp;dn":"Consumer+Reports+-+New+Car+Preview+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7df415cc2a254fba05886ef51241ae3937bcaeb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,244,21,204,42,37,79,186,5,136,110,245,18,65,174,57,55,188,174,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
