Schenker, however, would rejoin the band briefly during the recording and touring of 1979's Lovedrive.\n\nOf the album, vocalist Meine said:\n\n    With Lonesome Crow, we were just a young band trying to find our way, trying to shape an artistic style to find the Scorpions DNA. There was a ballad with &quot;In Search of the Peace of Mind&quot;, and a psychedelic rocker with the title track, &quot;I'm Goin' Mad&quot;, [which] was a great rocker with Michael Schenker playing great solos. We were just a young band with talented guys, with no idea on where to go from here.\n\n    For the subsequent album, Fly to the Rainbow, we brought in Uli Roth, who had a Hendrix influence, and Rudolf and I became a songwriter team. When Matthias Jabs joined the band, we found our style, fast riffs but great melodies, along with the power ballads.\n\nThe album was used as the soundtrack to the German anti-drug movie Das Kalte Paradies.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Scorpions\n\n1. \t&quot;I'm Goin' Mad&quot;   \t4:53\n2. \t&quot;It All Depends&quot;   \t3:30\n3. \t&quot;Leave Me&quot;   \t5:06\n4. \t&quot;In Search of the Peace of Mind&quot;   \t4:59\n5. \t&quot;Inheritance&quot;   \t4:41\n6. \t&quot;Action&quot;   \t3:56\n7. \t&quot;Lonesome Crow&quot;   \t13:31\n\n\n\nScorpions\n\n    Klaus Meine - vocals\n    Michael Schenker - lead guitar, backing vocals\n    Rudolf Schenker - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n    Lothar Heimberg - bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Wolfgang Dziony - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85c687f1b28b1429988ca47db4e91611aabba25d","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Lonesome+Crow+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85c687f1b28b1429988ca47db4e91611aabba25d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,198,135,241,178,139,20,41,152,140,164,125,180,233,22,17,170,187,162,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
