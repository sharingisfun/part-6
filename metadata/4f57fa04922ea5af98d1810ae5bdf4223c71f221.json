Just as Shankar influenced George Harrison and others, Toumani has already made an impact on the music of Bjork, Damon Albarn and those at the more adventurous end of the rock spectrum. \nIf the album title was chosen to echo Bach's Goldberg Variations, it's a good analogy, for there's a courtly grace and elegance to these eight long, solo instrumental pieces. The effect is meditative - this is music for the head. And yet there is rhythm, too, of an astonishingly subtle complexity, although you'd have trouble dancing to it. Some have found the music's intricate, dignified counterpoint too austere to maintain concentration. Repeated listening pays dividends however - there's a voluptuousness in Toumani's endlessly varying contours of interdependent melody, harmony and rhythm that is quite engrossing. How a solo instrument recorded without overdubs can sound so lush and layered is remarkable - once again, Shankar comes to mind. Nor has the general seriousness of purpose dimmed Toumani's sense of fun - I am indebted to fellow music critic John Mulvey for pointing out that the opening phrases of 'Cantelowes' are a playful quotation from The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly, a little riff Toumani picked up from Bassekou Kouyate while recording his Djelika album back in 1995. This is a heroic record in every sense. -- Nigel Williamson &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Mande-Variations-Toumani-Diabate/dp/B0011OJPT6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Mande-Variations-Toumani-Diabate/dp/B0011OJPT6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n1- Si naani\n2- Elyne Road\n3- Ali Farka Toure\n4- Kaounding Cissko\n5- Ismael Drame\n6- Djourou Kara Nany\n7- El Nabiyouna\n8- Cantelowes\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f57fa04922ea5af98d1810ae5bdf4223c71f221","amp;dn":"Toumani+Diabate+-+The+Mande+Variations+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f57fa04922ea5af98d1810ae5bdf4223c71f221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,87,250,4,146,46,165,175,152,209,129,10,229,189,244,34,60,113,242,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
