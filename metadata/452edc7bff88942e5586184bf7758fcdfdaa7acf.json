For seven years, from 1971 until 1978, they produced an enviable array of albums awash in good-time music, rollicking high-energy blues-rock, and white Southern soul, and for their trouble they racked up just one Top Ten hit (&quot;Keep On Smilin'&quot;) and a lot of admirers. In contrast to the Allman Brothers Band, whose jumping-off point was really Cream and who based their music on long jams, Wet Willie were closer in spirit to Booker T. &amp; the MG's and perhaps the Mar-Keys, of Stax/Volt fame, much more steeped in sweaty, good-time R&amp;B than the blues-rock of the Allmans or the country-rock of the Marshall Tucker Band. Think of what Lynyrd Skynyrd might have sounded like with but one lead guitar on a white chitlin circuit, if such a thing had existed.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Keep On Smilin'\n02.Shout Bamalama\n03.Airport\n04.Leona\n05.Everything That 'Cha Do\n06.Grits Ain't Groceries\n07.Country Side Of Life\n08.Red Hot Chicken\n09.Dixie Rock\n10.Baby Fat\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:452edc7bff88942e5586184bf7758fcdfdaa7acf","amp;dn":"Wet+Willie+-+Greatest+Hits+%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"452edc7bff88942e5586184bf7758fcdfdaa7acf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,46,220,123,255,136,148,46,85,134,24,75,247,117,143,205,253,170,122,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
