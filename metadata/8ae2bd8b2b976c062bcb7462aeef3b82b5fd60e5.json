Loaded with action, this game will challenge you to become Seacrest County's top cop or most wanted racer. Ever in a Need for Speed game, you'll be able to play a full career on either side of the law.\n\nRaces take place in four environments which differ in atmosphere, with a handful of tracks per environment. The different tracks in an environment are formed by different roads being connected or separated by road blocks. Hot Pursuit, which features weather and day/night variation independent of track, and widely varying environments from snowy mountains over cities to desert, Hot Pursuit 2 tracks have significantly less variation. Hot Pursuit 2 is also the first in the series to lack an in-car view that was available in preceding Need for Speed titles. As with the original, the player also has the option to play as a police officer trying to arrest speeders. To do so the player rams the speeding vehicle multiple times to disable it. The player must turn on their lights and sirens while in pursuit, and they automatically turn off after arresting the suspect. As a Police you can call for a road block, spike strips, and request help from a helicopter to assist in chasing the target vehicle. At the end, the player is awarded for the cars busted.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\nCPU:\tIntel Pentium IV (or higher)\nRAM:\t256 MB\nVGA:\t32MB DirectX 9.0c compatible video card\nDX:\tDirectX 9.0c\nOS:\tWindows 98,ME,2000,XP Professional\nHDD:\t900 MB of HD space\nSound:\tDirectX compatible Sound Card\nODD:\t8X CD-ROM\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\nAfter download extract the file.
