Based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine is armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and a wickedly naughty wit. He fights the good fight - or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to abandon his campaign against evil until a series of events thrusts him back into the fray when an old friend's daughter becomes the target of supernatural forces.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:786b5b16aa88fbf9366216635cdd69e71cc22c2f","amp;dn":"Constantine.S01E12.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"786b5b16aa88fbf9366216635cdd69e71cc22c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,107,91,22,170,136,251,249,54,98,22,99,92,221,105,231,28,194,44,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
