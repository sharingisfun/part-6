The Ford F150 is built inside one of the company's most modern production facilities-the Dearborn Truck Plant in Michigan. The facility has three main buildings: the body shop, the paint shop, and the final assembly line. The plant is built from the ground up to maximize efficiency and a new F150 rolls off the assembly line every minute. It is a remarkable feat since the Dearborn Truck Plant manufactures ten of the eleven F150 models.
