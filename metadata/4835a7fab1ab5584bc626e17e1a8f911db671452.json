Videos, images, and narratives featuring graphic violence, often brought back from combat zones, viewed voyeuristically or for emotional gratification. Such media are often presented and circulated without context, though they may be used as evidence of war crimes. \r\n\r\nWar pornÂ is also, in Roy Scrantonâ€™s searing debut novel, a metaphor for the experience of war in the age of the War on Terror, the fracturing and fragmentation of perspective, time, and self that afflicts soldiers and civilians alike, and the global networks and face-to-face moments that suture our fragmented lives together. In War PornÂ three lives fit insideÂ oneÂ another like nesting dolls: a restless young woman at an end-of-summer barbecue in Utah; an American soldier in occupied Baghdad; and Qasim al-Zabadi, an Iraqi math professor, who faces the US invasion of his country with fear, denial, and perseverance. AsWar PornÂ cuts from America to Iraq and back again, as home and hell merge, we come to see America through the eyes of the occupied, even as we see Qasim become a prisoner of the occupation. Through the looking glass ofWar Porn, Scranton reveals the fragile humanity that connects Americans and Iraqis, torturers and the tortured, victors and their victims","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4835a7fab1ab5584bc626e17e1a8f911db671452","amp;dn":"War+Porn+-+Roy+Scranton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4835a7fab1ab5584bc626e17e1a8f911db671452","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,53,167,250,177,171,85,132,188,98,110,23,225,168,249,17,219,103,20,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
