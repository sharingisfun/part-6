He is of international fame and has recently been selected as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency. He was born in Nea Kokinia, Piraeus. His father was Loukas Daralas, a singer of rebetiko.\n\nAfter several LPs and further collaborations with Kouyioumtzis, Kaldaras, Manos LoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯zos , Mikis Theodorakis and others, Dalaras decided to release his own renditions of rebetiko songs on the double LP 50 Chronia Rebetiko Tragoudi released 1975. \nThe recording proved an immediate success, despite the toning down of the lyrics. However, as a result, a new movement was set to take place in Greek music, and the once forgotten rebetes were finding themselves performing, in some cases for the first time in 30 to 40 years.
