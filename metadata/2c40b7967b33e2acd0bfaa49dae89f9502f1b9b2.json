That's too narrow. Trust is much broader, and much more important. Nothing in society works without trust. It's the foundation of communities, commerce, democracyÃ¢â‚¬â€everything.\n\nIn this insightful and entertaining book, Schneier weaves together ideas from across the social and biological sciences to explain how society induces trust. He shows how trust works and fails in social settings, communities, organizations, countries, and the world.\n\nIn today's hyper-connected society, understanding the mechanisms of trust is as important as understanding electricity was a century ago. Issues of trust and security are critical to solving problems as diverse as corporate responsibility, global warming, and our moribund political system. After reading Liars and Outliers, you'll think about social problems, large and small, differently.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c40b7967b33e2acd0bfaa49dae89f9502f1b9b2","amp;dn":"Liars.and.Outliers.Feb.2012+OnlyGill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c40b7967b33e2acd0bfaa49dae89f9502f1b9b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,64,183,150,123,51,226,172,208,191,170,73,218,232,159,149,2,241,185,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
