Perhaps he really didn't want to know. When the son of his black gardener is arrested and beaten as a result of a schoolboy protest in Soweto, at first he imagines the police must have had their reasons. However, the boy is picked up again, and this time he doesn't come back. Ben promises his servant that he will look into the incident, and discovers that the boy was killed simply to gratify the violent urges of Captain Stolz (Jurgen Prochnow), a &quot;special branch&quot; policeman. At long last he has gotten a glimpse into the truly arbitrary and violent nature of the system he has so long benefitted from, and he hires Ian Mackenzie (Marlon Brando) to prosecute the killer. It is a foregone conclusion that Stolz will not be punished, but Mackenzie rises to new heights of withering sarcasm and irony in the courtroom. This situation turns Ben into a radical firebrand, which alienates him from his white friends and neighbors, as well as members of his family. \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097243/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097243/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=bf882109-9472-4c55-9f1a-fe36aaea0c93&amp;k=a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=bf882109-9472-4c55-9f1a-fe36aaea0c93&amp;k=a&lt;/a&gt; dry white season\n\n\n\n\nAwards:Nominated for Oscar.
