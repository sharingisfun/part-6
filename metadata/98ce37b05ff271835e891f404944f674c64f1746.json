Since its initial publication in 1981, this best-selling volume has been an essential resource for Jews seeking to better understand their own heritage and for non-Jews desirous of understanding the lifestyle of their neighbors.\n\nIn this now-classic work, Rabbi Alfred J. Kolatch presents hundreds of questions frequently asked about Jewish belief and practice and provides answers that are concise, clear, and straightforward. Whether discussing the celebration of milestone events, the definition of Jewish identity, conversion from another faith, death and mourning practices and procedures, synagogue ritual, or the rationale behind the kosher dietary laws, he presents the range of views held by the major Jewish denominations: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist. The information is presented simply and objectively, replacing confusion and misconception with knowledge and understanding.\n\nEnhanced by an index that makes the information readily accessible, The Jewish Book of Why is authoritative, enlightening, and indispensable.\n\n\nVolume 2:\nIn The Jewish Book of Why, Rabbi Alfred J. Kolatch addresses hundreds of fundamental questions frequently asked about Jewish life and practice. In this sequel volume, he delves more deeply into the subject matter touched upon in that best-selling work and goes on to explore more complex and controversial subjects, including abortion, homosexuality, birth control, artificial insemination, organ transplants, smoking, proselytizing, intermarriage, Jewish-Christian relations, and the changing role of women in Jewish life.\n\nRecognizing the importance of our understanding how Jewish law developed and how legal authorities arrived at their decisions, Rabbi Kolatch opens The Second Jewish Book of Why with an overview of Jewish legal development from biblical times to the present. He introduces us to the major interpreters of Jewish law, explores the relationship between law and custom, and explains the basic principles upon which much of Jewish practice is based.\n\nFollowing the same concise question-answer format he established in The Jewish Book of Why and the straightforward writing style for which he is renowned, Rabbi Kolatch addresses all questions without judgment or bias, presenting the beliefs and practices of all denominations. Featuring notes and a detailed index covering both of the Why volumes, The Second Jewish Book of Why is essential for anyone seeking an understanding of the Jewish heritage.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nAlfred J. Kolatch, a graduate of the Teachers Institute of Yeshiva University and its College of Liberal Arts, was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, which subsequently awarded him the Doctor of Divinity degree, honoris causa.
