Their 1977 single, Forming/Sexboy (live), is generally regarded as the first punk record from Los Angeles.\n\nThe Germs, despite all expectations, developed a sound that was extremely aggressive, hyper-competent, and highly influential -- although throughout their career, they would have a reputation as a chaotic live band. Singer Darby Crash often arrived onstage nearly incoherent from drugs, singing everywhere but into the microphone and taunting the audience between songs. The other band members had similar problems, with many contemporary reviews citing collapses, incoherence, and drunken vomiting onstage.\n\nThe Germs recorded two singles (with alternate tracks), an album-length demo session, and one full-length LP, (GI), each more focused and powerful than the last. Crash was, despite his erratic behavior, generally regarded as a brilliant lyricist (a contemporary critic described him as &quot;ransacking the dictionary&quot;), and the final lineup of Smear, Doom, and Bolles had become a world-class rock ensemble by the recording of (GI), turning in a performance that spurred an LA Weekly reviewer to write, &quot;This album leaves exit wounds.&quot; It is considered one of the first hardcore punk records, and has a near-mythic status among alternative rock fans.\n\nThis torrent contains all the tracks found on MIA, which is the complete Germs discography.\n\n1.
