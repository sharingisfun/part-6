While old-time traditionalists will be green with envy at the effortless ease with which he blows through songs like Merle Travis' &quot;Nine Pound Hammer&quot; and Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;Georgia on My Mind,&quot; they will scoff at the crazy percussive sound effects he wrangles out of the strings and body in a rousing rave-up of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; with harmonica player and stage guest Bob Littell. And when they hit the point in the CD where Emmanuel creates underwater-sounding feedback weirdness on &quot;Initiation,&quot; they'll probably throw a conniption, because people just aren't supposed to make whale songs with just an acoustic guitar and a few effects circuits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ noises that come darn near blowing one's speakers if the volume has been jacked up so as not to miss Emmanuel's subtle fingerpicking glories earlier in the set.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6774a920b6b800a85e3f2c74885972ed4da00adb","amp;dn":"Tommy_Emmanuel_2008_Center_Stage_MP3_64_320bps_VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6774a920b6b800a85e3f2c74885972ed4da00adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,116,169,32,182,184,0,168,94,63,44,116,136,89,114,237,77,160,10,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
