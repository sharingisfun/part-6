Translated with Notes by E. H. and A. M. Blackmore, with an Introduction by Elizabeth McCombie.\n\nISBN: 9780199537921 | 320 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF + EPUB\n\n\nSTÃƒâ€°PHANE MALLARMÃƒâ€° (1842-1898) was the most radically innovative of nineteenth-century poets, and a key figure in Modernism.  His writings, with their richly sensuous texture and air of slyly intangible mystery, perplexed or outraged many early readers; yet no writer has more profoundly influenced the course of modern poetry -- in English as well as in French. \n\nThis is the fullest collection of MallarmÃƒÂ©'s poetry ever published in English, and the only edition in any language that presents his PoÃƒÂ©sies in the last arrangement known to have been approved by the author.  Prose poems, uncollected verse, and the unique, unclassifiable Un Coup de dÃƒÂ©s... (A Dice Throw...) are also present, including over 20 items that have never previously been translated.  Original spelling, punctuation, and lineation have been preserved throughout.\n\nThe lucid, wide-ranging introduction provides a clear survey of MallarmÃƒÂ©'s work and deals fully with the difficulties that may face readers approaching it for the first time.  COLLECTED POEMS offers both MallarmÃƒÂ© lovers and first-time readers a full understanding of this astonishing poet's work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902efb49468c067631baf3bb1365c4489aa6824d","amp;dn":"Stephane+Mallarme+-+Collected+Poems+%26amp%3B+Other+Verse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902efb49468c067631baf3bb1365c4489aa6824d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,46,251,73,70,140,6,118,49,186,243,187,19,101,196,72,154,166,130,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
