As the brain is increasingly examined in the context of personal and organizational development, remarkable insights are being uncovered: insights that are leading to powerful new strategies for improving business execution.\n\nIn Your Brain and Business, Harvard psychiatrist, brain-imaging researcher, and executive coach Srinivasan S. Pillay illuminates the rapidly emerging links between modern brain science and the corner office. He reveals powerful ways that neuroscientific insights can be used practically by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s executives and presents new lessons for coaches who want to help their clients overcome common leadership problems.\n\nDiscover how leaders and coaches worldwide are already applying this knowledge to dramatically improve personal performance--and learn how you can do it, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2ff886cde6a8f03930dc14c5f714287345d169","amp;dn":"Your+Brain+and+Business%3A+The+Neuroscience+of+Great+Leaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2ff886cde6a8f03930dc14c5f714287345d169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,47,248,134,205,230,168,240,57,48,220,20,197,247,20,40,115,69,209,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
