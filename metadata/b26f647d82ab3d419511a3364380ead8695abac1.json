He has picked fights with douche bags openly brandishing guns. He has set himself on fire at parties and woken up in dumpsters after cocaine binges. He lost his virginity at eleven. He got rich and famous and immersed himself in booze, women, and chaos until one day he realised, suddenly, that he didn't need any of that at all.\n\nSeven Deadly Sins is a brutally honest look at a life that could have gone horribly wrong at any turn, and the soul-searching and self-discovery it took to set it right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26f647d82ab3d419511a3364380ead8695abac1","amp;dn":"The+Seven+Deadly+Sins+-+Corey+Taylor+-+2011.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26f647d82ab3d419511a3364380ead8695abac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,111,100,125,130,171,61,65,149,17,163,54,67,128,234,216,105,90,186,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
