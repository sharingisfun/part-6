They are best known for their song &quot;Island In The Sun&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe band's initial line-up consisted of former Rainbow frontman Graham Bonnet, young Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, who had recently left American band Steeler, Gary Shea and Jimmy Waldo from New England and Clive Burr of Iron Maiden fame. Burr was in the band for a week, and left after discovering the band was going to be based in the United States. Burr was replaced by former Iron Butterfly drummer Jan Uvena, who had just left Alice Cooper's backing band. Shea dubbed the group &quot;Alcatrazz&quot;. For the first album, the bulk of the material was written by Bonnet and Malmsteen, with Waldo contributing to several tracks.\r\n\r\nThe band's debut album, No Parole From Rock 'N' Roll surfaced in late 1983 on Rocshire Records. Decent support was given by MTV to the lead single, Island In The Sun, which showed a heavy Rainbow influence. \r\n\r\nBonus the Demo tracks instrumentals of course those were done by Yngwie so those are a real bonus. \r\n\r\n\r\nYEAR : 1983/2013\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Hard Rock, Heavy Metal\r\n\r\nDURATION: 1:19:43\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320ak\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n01.
