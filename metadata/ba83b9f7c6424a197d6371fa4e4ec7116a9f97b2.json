They frequently retell Biblical stories, sometimes anachronistically reframed, and include humorous references to pop culture. The series was developed by Big Idea Entertainment and is owned by DreamWorks through its subsidiary, Classic Media.[1]\n\nVeggieTales was created by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki, who also provide many of the voices. Originally released in direct-to-video format, the series debuted on December 21, 1993. From September 9, 2006 to September 7, 2009, VeggieTales appeared on NBC as part of the qubo Saturday morning children's programming block. On November 3, 2012 the show began running on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN)[2] as well as its children's network Smile of a Child,[3] where it currently continues to air (in a repackaged and edited format).\n\nIn 2009, Netflix made many VeggieTales videos (in their uncut, original formats) and feature films available via their video streaming service. On March 14, 2014, Netflix announced that production is starting on a new Dreamworks-licensed VeggieTales television show entitled VeggieTales In The House.[4] Big Idea has also published VeggieTales books and music CDs and branded items such as toys, clothing, and garden seeds for vegetables and flowers.\n\nVeggieTales was created by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki through their company Big Idea Productions. Their aim was to produce children's videos which conveyed Christian moral themes and taught Biblical values and lessons. The animated feature involved stories told by a group of recurring vegetable characters who lived on a kitchen countertop. The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, Where's God When I'm S-Scared?, released in July 1993. In all, Big Idea has released 45 VeggieTales episodes including three Silly Song collections, 5 holiday specials, 4 LarryBoy episodes and a drawing tutorial. In addition to these episodes, there are 13 compilations that combine previously released material, and two feature length movies, Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie and The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie. Beginning in 2006, the VeggieTales videos were adapted as a regular television program through the Qubo multi-platform network and NBC network. On September 30, 2008, Big Idea said that Mike Nawrocki would create an &quot;original new VeggieTales TV series,&quot; though no further news has been revealed.[5]\n\nThe idea for VeggieTales came in the early 90's when Phil Vischer was testing out animation software as a medium for children's videos.[6] Due to the limitations of the software available to him, he chose to avoid the technical production hurdle of creating characters with arms, legs, or hair. His first animation model on the software was an anthropomorphic candy bar, but after his wife suggested that parents might not want to show their children videos with a candy hero, he instead chose to use fruits and vegetables, their polar opposite.\n\nPOtHS Says: December 25 was the day that the Wise Men, brought Jesus gifts when he was 15 months old, NOT THE DAY HE AS BORN.\nDownload Star of Bethlehem Below.\n\nOther Christmas Specials\n\n\n\nChristmas Special - Jesus of Nazareth - DVD &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11618182/Christmas_Special_-_Jesus_of_Nazareth_-_DVD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11618182/Christmas_Special_-_Jesus_of_Nazareth_-_DVD&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - The Star of Bethlehem &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11611654/Christmas_Special_-_The_Star_of_Bethlehem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11611654/Christmas_Special_-_The_Star_of_Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - WoW Gospel - 1996 thru 2015 - 20 yrs of Christ in Music &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11620224/Christmas_Special_-_WoW_Gospel_-_1996_thru_2015_-_20_yrs_of_Chri&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11620224/Christmas_Special_-_WoW_Gospel_-_1996_thru_2015_-_20_yrs_of_Chri&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - Origins - What Christmas Is Really About - It ain't Santa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11627909/Christmas_Special_-_Origins_-_What_Christmas_Is_Really_About_-_I#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11627909/Christmas_Special_-_Origins_-_What_Christmas_Is_Really_About_-_I#&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - The Holy Bible - Audio - KJV - Alexander Scourby the Voice of The Bible &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11633397/Christmas_Special_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Audio_-_KJV_-_Alexander_Sco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11633397/Christmas_Special_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Audio_-_KJV_-_Alexander_Sco&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlexander Scourby (/Ã‹Ë†skÃ‰â€rbi/; November 13, 1913 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ February 22, 1985) was an American film, television, and voice actor known for his deep and resonant voice.[1] He is best known for his film role as the ruthless mob boss Mike Lagana in Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953), and is also particularly well-remembered in the English-speaking world for his landmark recordings of the entire King James Version audio Bible, which have been released in numerous editions.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
