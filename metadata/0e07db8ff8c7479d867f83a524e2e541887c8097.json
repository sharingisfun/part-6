The line runs from Dingwall to Kyle of Lochalsh on the west coast of Scotland, but most passengers tend to start their journey at Inverness.\n\nThis Just Trains route runs for 83 miles and includes 17 finely modelled stations, eight localised reskins for the default Class 37 which have been enhanced with realistic dynamics, 14 Standard and two Free Roam scenarios, and numerous custom buildings and objects.\n\nInverness is the capital of the Highlands, located 158 miles north of Edinburgh and 561 miles from London, but still well over 100 miles away from John O'Groats at the very northern tip of Scotland!\n\nFrom bustling Inverness with its impressive station and Train Maintenance Depot (TMD) with automatically operating roller shutter doors, we head west and proceed over the Caledonian Canal via its unique swing bridge - see the bridge swing closed as you approach it to allow you to cross.\n\nFrom them on you are driving beside various lochs, through farmland, dense forests, alongside craggy steep rock faces and over numerous streams. Along the way you will see 17 stations, including the one with the shortest platform in the UK!\n\nAs you get further in your journey the land starts to open up and you really do feel the expanse and remoteness of the Highlands. Not far from Kyle you will pass under the unique snow shelter covering the line near Attadale before arriving at the end of the line at Kyle of Lochalsh station.\n\nNOTE---&gt; THIS WORKS ON THE LEGIT &amp; PIRATED VERSIONS OF TS2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e07db8ff8c7479d867f83a524e2e541887c8097","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Just+Trains+The+Kyle+Line+-+Inverness+to+Kyle+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e07db8ff8c7479d867f83a524e2e541887c8097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,7,219,143,248,199,71,157,134,127,131,165,36,226,229,65,136,124,128,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
