It leverages the\npower of its new and superior kernel and provides a fluid and efficient\ndesign experience.\nZWCAD+ ensures even greater .dwg support, better memory control, and\ncode-level API compatibility, making it an all-encompassing solution\nfor users in the AEC and MCAD industries.\n\nNOTE: This new version has improved stability, increased ease of use\nand advanced localization, which gives users a more fluid experience.\nWith these updates, designers will be able to better take advantage of\nthe new and superior kernel and complete their work faster and more\nefficiently.\n\nRead and write .dwg files more accurately\nThe already excellent .dwg support on ZWCAD 2012 now gets even better\non ZWCAD+. Having been through over 50,000 extremely rigorous drawing\ntests to guarantee seamless .dwg compatibility, ZWCAD+ makes\ncross-platform communication easier than ever before.\n\nTake on tougher design tasks more easily\nThe new memory optimization technology enables ZWCAD+ to open any\ndrawing with memory usage reduced by 50%. That's why it works smoothly\nwith  drawings that are even over 100 MB. It's also excellent in\nreducing  memory accumulation, which ensures non-stop operation\nthroughout the day.\n\nPort application more efficiently\nZRX and ARX are now code-level compatible. Lisp routines can now run\ndirectly on ZWCAD+ with only a few modifications. The new APIs enable\ndevelopers to port their applications to ZWCAD+ ten times faster. The\nported applications run up to 8 times faster when compared with ZWCAD.\n\nInteract with a new Ribbon UI more fluidly\nThe ribbon interface of ZWCAD+ might just be the cleanest ribbon UI\never. Its ribbon panel is designed to have JUST-ENOUGH buttons that all\nshow on the panel, which brings simplicity to the whole interface and\nhelps increase your productivity.\n\nNew and Enhanced Features Boost Your Design Efficiency\nMore frequently used functions have been added to ZWCAD+, including\nAssociative Dimension, Block Attribute Manager, Field (Object),\nViewport Maximization, and Cycle Select. Fundamental enhancements, such\nas Tool Palettes, Revision Cloud, Snap, Match Properties, and Batch\nProcessing on Layouts, have also been made to take your design\nefficiency to the next level.\n\n\nHOW TO INSTALL/RUN THIS RELEASE\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1 - Unpack the release into a directory of your choice.\n2 - Run the installer and install it.\n3 - Copy the files from /crack into the installation directory.\n4 - Have a go with this unlimited trial, but buy it if you will use it.\n5 - As always, make sure to have a firewall to block outbound\nconnections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30937dda518742c53a9ae4c4180a543ad5a8b1a9","amp;dn":"ZWCAD.ZW3D.v2015.X64-AMPED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30937dda518742c53a9ae4c4180a543ad5a8b1a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,147,125,218,81,135,66,197,58,154,228,196,24,10,84,58,213,168,177,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
