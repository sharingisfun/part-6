One of the jewels of Russian literature.\n\nSince its publication in 1842, Dead Souls has been celebrated as a supremely realistic portrait of provincial Russian life and as a splendidly exaggerated tale; as a paean to the Russian spirit and as a remorseless satire of imperial Russian venality, vulgarity, and pomp. As Gogol's wily antihero, Chichikov, combs the back country wheeling and dealing for &quot;dead souls&quot;--deceased serfs who still represent money to anyone sharp enough to trade in them--we are introduced to a Dickensian cast of peasants, landowners, and conniving petty officials, few of whom can resist the seductive illogic of Chichikov's proposition. This lively, idiomatic English version by the award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky makes accessible the full extent of the novel's lyricism, sulphurous humor, and delight in human oddity and error.\n\nEpisode 1 (23 April 2006)\n\n    Charmer Chichikov arrives in town with his narrator in tow, and starts\n    touting for dead souls.  Why? What is he going to do with them? Suspicions\n    come to a head at the Governor's Ball, the highlight of provincial\n    Russian society.\n\nEpisode 2 (30 April 2006)\n\n    In disgrace, Chichikov is arrested but escapes with the narrator's help\n    to another part of Russia.  He at last seems determined to make a fresh\n    start and become an honest man.  However, his past is about to catch up\n    with him.\n\nCast:\n\n    Chichikov - Mark Heap\n    Narrator - Michael Palin\n    Korabochka - Judith Davis\n    Koshkaryov - Wyllie Longmore\n    Kostanzhoglo - David Fleeshman\n    Manilov - David Fleeshman\n    Nozdryov - Toby Hadoke\n    Selifan - Graeme Hawley\n    Sobakevich - Wyllie Longmore\n    Tenteknikov - Toby Hadoke\n    Ulinka - Rina Mahoney\n\nWritten by - Nikolai Gogol\nDramatised by - Dan Rebellato\nDirected by Polly Thomas\nSound Design by Steve Brooke\n\nBitRate - 128 kbps\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
