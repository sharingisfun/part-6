Although the Lovell Sisters shine throughout, whether as singers or as musicians, this is most definitely a Larkin Poe Band album from start to finish with a fuller sound than heard before and I can only put that down to Thom HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inclusion.\n\nAll 10 songs come from the pens of Rebecca, Megan and Thom plus a couple of collaborations too, with all three proving that they can write a fine and memorable song on an album that was recorded over two years; and I defy you to see the joins.\n\nI Belong to Love opens the proceedings and is as good, if not better than anything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard from the LovellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and things only get better as song after song soars to heights IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never imagined that they could achieve.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in all its formats weaves a thread though the whole album; be it straightforward boy meets girl/girl falls in love/boy leaves girl or the intricately clever Missing Home when Hell takes the lead and sounds uncannily like Graham Nash as he ponders if he can keep the girl when she becomes homesick.\n\nPS I Love is just as clever; with Hell and Rebecca alternating verses discussing a long distance relationship that may or may not have a happy ending.\n\nThen; on the beautiful song, Leave the Lovells and Hell combine to harmonise in a pitch perfect manner not heard since CSN&amp;Y were in the ascendancy forty years ago.\n\nApart from the three wonderful voices; RebeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mandolin and guitar playing weave a golden thread around MeganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s timeless lap-steel and Resophonic guitar to produce music that will take your breath away.\n\nThe album finishes with Rebecca and the haunting WidowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Talk which just might be the finest song youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear all year.\n\nWith the addition of Thomas Hell, Larkin Poe finally sound like a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcomplete bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and can now mount a challenge on their home country; America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3f0fdfa797d786399488b8a04581909f9ad71a","amp;dn":"Larkin+Poe+%26amp%3B+Thom+Hell+-+The+Sound+of+the+Ocean+Sound+%5B2013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3f0fdfa797d786399488b8a04581909f9ad71a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,63,15,223,167,151,215,134,57,148,136,184,160,69,129,144,159,154,215,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
