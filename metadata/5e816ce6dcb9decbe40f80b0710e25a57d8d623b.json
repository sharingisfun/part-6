This movie is based on a true story, a vivid testimony as to how the Bible changes lives forever. \n\nAt the close of the 19th century, the British branded the Hmar people of northeast India as &quot;the worst headhunters.&quot; It was a label well deserved at the time. But in 1910, a single copy of the gospel of John came into this village and changed the course of history for the Hmar people. Throug h that single copy of John's Gospel, Chawnga, the father of Rochunga Pudaite, was introduced to a revolutionary &quot;new life in Christ.&quot; He and a few tribesmen &quot;forsook all and followed Christ.&quot; Chawnga believed that Rochunga was God's chosen instrument to bring the Scriptures to the entire Hmar tribe in their own language. This is the story of Rochunga's personal pilgrimage. It is an unforgettable saga of his dedication to a vision and of the Lord's direction in his life. \n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nRun Time: 99 minutes\nMy Rating: 9.5/10\nQuality: 9.5/10 (Dvdrip)\n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business.
