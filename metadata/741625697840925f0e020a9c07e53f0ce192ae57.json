For over fifty years, humanity has continued to use earth-destroying primitive fuels when an ocean of infinite energy teems all around us. It is time that the truth be known!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n(Steven M. Greer, M.D., author of Hidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge )\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPaul LaViolette is one of the most interesting and innovative thinkers probing the limits and horizons of contemporary physics. In this book he takes up a challenge that many of us have thought about but could not document: the possibility of propulsion systems that practically defy gravity. His findings merit earnest consideration, debate, and discussion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n(Ervin Laszlo, author of Science and the Akashic Field )\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne of the boldest and most exciting books on gravity control to be put forward in our times.

Townsend Brown to the B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber. He discloses the existence of advanced gravity-control technologies, under secret military development for decades, that could revolutionize air travel and energy production. Included among the secret projects he reveals is the research of Project Skyvault to develop an aerospace propulsion system using intense beams of microwave energy similar to that used by the strange crafts seen flying over Area 51.\n\nUsing subquantum kinetics--the science behind antigravity technology--LaViolette reviews numerous field-propulsion devices and technologies that have thrust-to-power ratios thousands of times greater than that of a jet engine and whose effects are not explained by conventional physics and relativity theory. He then presents controversial evidence about the NASA cover-up in adopting these advanced technologies. He also details ongoing Russian research to duplicate John SearlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-propelled levitating disc and shows how the results of the Podkletnov gravity beam experiment could be harnessed to produce an interstellar spacecraft.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n   * Paperback: 512 pages\n   * Publisher: Bear &amp; Company; First Edition edition (September 2008)\n   * Language: English\n   * ISBN-10: 159143078X\n   * ISBN-13: 978-1591430780\n   * Product Dimensions: 8.8 x 6.2 x 1.4 inches\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Antigravity-Propulsion-Classified-Technology/dp/159143078X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1286043564&amp;sr=1-1,physics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Antigravity-Propulsion-Classified-Technology/dp/159143078X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1286043564&amp;sr=1-1,physics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:741625697840925f0e020a9c07e53f0ce192ae57","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Antigravity+Propulsion%3A+Tesla%2C+UFOs%2C+and+Classified+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"741625697840925f0e020a9c07e53f0ce192ae57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,22,37,105,120,64,146,95,14,2,10,156,7,229,63,12,225,146,174,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
