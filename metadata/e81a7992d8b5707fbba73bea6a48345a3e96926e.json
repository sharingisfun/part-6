DIRECTX(R) INSTALLATION\nThe Cars installer will offer you to update your version of DirectX(R).  Select this option if your actual DirectX(R) version is older than DirectX(R) 9.0c.  THQ recommends allowing the installer to proceed with the DirectX(R) 9.0c installation, even if you think you may have 9.0c installed.  Re-installing DirectX(R) 9.0c will not harm your DirectX(R) configuration. Cars requires DirectX(R) 9.0c to play.\n\n\n================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\n================================================\n\n1. VIDEO ISSUES\n\nCars only supports ATI or NVIDIA video cards. The latest drivers are required:\n\nFor best performance and video quality, please make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card when running Cars. If you have an ATI or NVIDIA video card, you can find drivers on their websites.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.ati.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.ati.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.nvidia.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.nvidia.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCars does not support on board video cards. If you using a computer with the video chipset on the motherboard then you may experience and number of problems running the game. \n\n2. SOUND ISSUES\n\nLatest drivers required\n\nPlease make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card when running Cars.\n\n3. MOTHERBOARD DRIVERS\n\nCars requires the latest video card AND motherboard drivers to be installed, as there have been significant issues in recent, but not the latest, drivers. Please make sure you are running the latest drivers available for BOTH your video card and motherboard.\n\nOften motherboard drivers are overlooked when updating systems, and as a result most computers are running very old versions that simply do not work properly and may cause very noticeable slow downs and stability issues.\n\n4. KEYBOARD / INPUT ISSUES\n\nIf you are having input difficulties please ensure you have the latest service pack for the operating system you are using.  \n\nCars supports USB Game Pads.  Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your USB Game Pad when running Cars. PS/2 Game Pads are not supported by Cars.\n \n\n5. OPERATING SYSTEM-SPECIFIC ISSUES\n\nA.  Windows(R) Key Interrupts Game in 2000/XP\n\nIf the Windows(R) key is pressed during game play, the Start Menu will interrupt the game. Should this happen, simply press the Escape (Esc) key to close the menu and return to the game. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this from happening again except by being careful not to hit those keys while playing.\n\nB.  Administrator Privileges Needed To Install On Windows(r) 2000 or XP\n\nIf you are running Windows(R) 2000 or Windows(R) XP, you must have Administrator privileges to properly install the game. You do not, however, require Administrator privileges to play the game after it has been installed.\n\nFor information on how to change your user settings to obtain Administrator privileges, please refer to your Windows (R) documentation, or click the Start button and select  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Help and SupportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nC.  Alt-Tab to switch applications\n\nSome drivers do not support the Alt-Tab switching between Cars and other applications. It is highly recommended that you do not use Alt-Tab to switch to another program while Cars is running. If you wish to switch programs, first close Cars.\n\n6.
