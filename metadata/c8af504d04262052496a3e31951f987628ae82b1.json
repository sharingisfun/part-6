It is an impassioned protest against persecution and tyranny with an overriding message of peace. Renowned British baritone and composer Roderick Williams takes a look at the story behind A Child of Our Time and introduces conductor Mark Wigglesworth, the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales and soloists Tamara Wilson (soprano), Susan Bickley (mezzo-soprano), Peter Hoare (tenor) and James Creswell (bass).\r\n\r\nIn 1938, a young Polish Jew, whose parents were deported by the Nazis, shot a German diplomat in Paris. The Nazis seized on the assassination to rile Hitler's supporters into an anti-Semitic frenzy. Tippett shared the public horror at the events that followed and in 1939, began writing a musical protest, a work that expressed deep rage at the unprecedented crimes being committed by the Nazi regime, and despair at man's ability to commit acts of inhumanity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8af504d04262052496a3e31951f987628ae82b1","amp;dn":"BBC.Proms.2016.07.24.A.Child.of.Our.Time.EN.SUB.HEVC.x264.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8af504d04262052496a3e31951f987628ae82b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,175,80,77,4,38,32,82,73,106,62,49,149,31,152,118,40,174,130,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
