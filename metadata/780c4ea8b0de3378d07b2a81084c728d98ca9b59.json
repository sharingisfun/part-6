As the economic downturn, continuing climate change and the prevailing terrorist threat prove that the dangers facing our world loom larger than ever, Strauss decides he's had enough. Soon he is investigating ways of getting second citizenship on the island of St. Kitts, protecting his assets offshore, and making friends with an elite group of billionaires who are thinking exactly the same thing. Strauss' thirst for survival becomes more extreme as he prepares for The End Of The World As We Know It. He trains with guns, learns American Indian tracking skills, hides caches of supplies and acquires a special forces motorcycle to help him 'bug out'. When The Shit Hits The Fan, this book might just save your life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780c4ea8b0de3378d07b2a81084c728d98ca9b59","amp;dn":"Emergency+-+This+book+will+save+your+life+-+Neil+Strauss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780c4ea8b0de3378d07b2a81084c728d98ca9b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,12,78,168,176,222,51,120,208,123,42,129,8,76,114,141,152,202,155,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
