Having originated the first of such systems, Ken Day now shows how to apply the principles with or without elaborate systems. Such systems pay big dividends to the larger producer but this book still shows the small producer how to achieve competitive mix designs and close quality control without either excessive expenditure or extensive theoretical study.\n\nThe accompanying website, www.kenday.id.au, offers free programs and access to continually updated advice.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 384 pages\n    * Publisher: Spon Press; 3 edition (September 22, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0415393132\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0415393133","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a074fb2d236d73d3132b721094059888b33b46f","amp;dn":"Concrete+Mix+Design%2CQuality+Control+and+Specification%2C3rd+Ed%7BBBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a074fb2d236d73d3132b721094059888b33b46f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,7,79,178,210,54,215,61,49,50,183,33,9,64,89,136,139,51,180,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
