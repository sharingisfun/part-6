Multi-enzyme complexes and cooperativity are therefore treated in more detail than in any other textbook on the market. \nThe respected and well known author is one of the most experienced researchers into the topic and writes with outstanding style and didactic clarity. As with the previous editions, he presents here steady-state kinetics and fast reactions, supplementing each chapter with problems and solutions. For the first time, this edition features a companion website providing all figures in colour ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015b5ba705a350910b91b407856a645ac22a8c3b","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Enzyme+Kinetics%2C+4E+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015b5ba705a350910b91b407856a645ac22a8c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,91,91,167,5,163,80,145,11,145,180,7,133,106,100,90,194,42,140,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
