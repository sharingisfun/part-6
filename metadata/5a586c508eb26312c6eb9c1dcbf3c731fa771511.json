So, in actual fact, he is not only a pilot but a navigator, too. It is essential, therefore, especially during cross-country flights, that the pilot should be able to apply all the correct practices to his navigational task, in a timely manner, without being distracted from flying accurate headings, airspeeds and altitudes. Developing this skill is the very essence of single pilot navigation. The foundation on which this skill resides is meticulous flight planning. \n\nIt is the aim of this interactive, multimedia computer-based training (CBT) course to teach you every element of the theory underlying flight planning and the art of single-pilot navigation (and to prepare you for the PPL ground examinations) more quickly, effectively and enjoyably than ever before. \n\nIn order specifically to meet the JAR-FCL PPL theoretical knowledge requirements, this CBT also includes basic theory instruction in Radio-Navigation Aids. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Form of the Earth \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Mapping Direction &amp; Distance \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Aeroplane Magnetism \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Principles of Navigation \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Time &amp; Flight Planning \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ground D/F \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ADF, VOR/DME &amp; GPS \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ground Radar \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Chart Reference Material\n\n\nNote: There is a Trick to Run this cd.(coz its copyrighted)\n\n1. Mount with your mouting software (deamon, virtual clone etc)\n2. Install (Dont RUN)\n3.
