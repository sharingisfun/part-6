The choice is made by blues authority Neil Slaven, so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little doubt that these 75 tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all now public domain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are the real deal.  Walker is the bluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most inspirational early guitarist (only Charlie Christian can rival him in terms of influence), who adapted the improvisatory techniques of the jazzmen of the day and turned them blue. The phrases that resulted became the language blues guitarists had to learn. The original 40s versions of Mean Old World, Stormy Monday and T-Bone Shuffle on Disc One are followed by 50s re-readings on Disc Three, showing how much Walker himself developed.  But, in many ways, the story is what came next: Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Duane AllmanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ A whole generation of (mostly white) artists took WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s baton and ran with it, creating a genre of new blues. Even Hendrix copped the playing guitar behind the head trick! At around a tenner for three discs, this is a must for all blues guitar fans.\nReview From http://recordcollectormag.com\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] T-Bone Blues\n[02] I Got A Break Baby\n[03] Mean Old World\n[04] My Baby Left Me (Blues)\n[05] Come Back To Me Baby (Blues)\n[06] She Is Going To Ruin Me\n[07] I Can't Stand Being Away From You\n[08] No Worry Blues\n[09] Don't Leave Me Baby\n[10] Bobby Sox Blues\n[11] I'm Gonna Find My Baby\n[12] I'm In An Awful Mood\n[13] It's A Low Down Dirty Deal\n[14] Don't Give Me The Runaround\n[15] Hard Pain Blues\n[16] I Know Your Wig Is Gone\n[17] T-Bone Jumps Again\n[18] Call It Stormy Monday\n[19] She's My Old Time Used To Be\n[20] Midnight Blues\n[21] Triflin' Woman Blues\n[22] Long Skirt Baby Blues\n[23] Goodbye Blues\n[24] On Your Way Blues\n[25] The Natural Blues\n\nPlay Time - 01h:14m:20s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] T-Bone Shuffle\n[02] That's Better For Me\n[03] Vacation Blues\n[04] Prison Blues\n[05] Home Town Blues\n[06] I'm Gonna Move You Out And Get Somebody Else\n[07] She's The No-Sleepin'est Woman\n[08] Plain Old Downhome Blues\n[09] Born To Be No Good\n[10] I Want A Little Girl\n[11] I'm Still In Love With You\n[12] You're My Best Poker Hand\n[13] West Side Baby\n[14] Glamor Girl\n[15] Strollin' With Bone\n[16] You Don't Love Me\n[17] The Hustle Is On\n[18] Baby Broke My Heart\n[19] Evil Hearted Woman\n[20] No Reason\n[21] Look Me In The Eye\n[22] Alimony Blues\n[23] Life Is Too Short\n[24] You Don't Understand\n[25] I Get So Weary\n\nPlay Time - 01h:10m:49s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Tell Me What's The Reason\n[02] Cold, Cold Feeling\n[03] Get These Blues Off Me\n[04] Street Walkin' Woman\n[05] Here In The Dark\n[06] Party Girl\n[07] Love Is Just A Gamble\n[08] I'm Still In Love With You\n[09] Vida Lee\n[10] When The Sun Goes Down\n[11] I'll Always Be In Love With You\n[12] Teen Age Baby\n[13] Papa Ain't Salty\n[14] Why Not?\n[15] T-Bone Shuffle\n[16] Play On Little Girl\n[17] T-Bone Blues Special\n[18] Mean Old World\n[19] T-Bone Blues\n[20] Stormy Monday Blues\n[21] Blues For Marili\n[22] Evenin'\n[23] Blues Rock\n[24] Two Bones And A Pick\n[25] Shufflin' The Blues\n\nPlay Time - 01h:13m:43s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:38m:54s\nTotal File Size....................... 541mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
