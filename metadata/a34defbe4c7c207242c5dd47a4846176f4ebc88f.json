Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde. His work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd.[1]\n\nAn eccentric,[2] Satie was introduced as a &quot;gymnopedist&quot; in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the GymnopÃƒÂ©dies. Later, he also referred to himself as a &quot;phonometrician&quot; (meaning &quot;someone who measures sounds&quot;) preferring this designation to that of a &quot;musician&quot;, after having been called &quot;a clumsy but subtle technician&quot; in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.[3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Satie,_Erik&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Satie,_Erik&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34defbe4c7c207242c5dd47a4846176f4ebc88f","amp;dn":"Erik+Satie+Complete+Sheet+Music+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34defbe4c7c207242c5dd47a4846176f4ebc88f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,77,239,190,76,124,32,114,66,197,221,71,164,132,97,118,244,235,200,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
