In addition, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.\r\n\r\n&quot;Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,&quot; said Doug Lombardi at Valve. &quot;For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.&quot;\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n====================\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 7/Vista/XP \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom X3 8750 processor or better \r\nMemory: 1GB XP / 2GB Vista \r\nHard Disk Space: At least 7.6GB of Space \r\nVideo Card: Video card must be 256 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0\r\n\r\nMultilanguage Support:\r\n======================\r\n\r\nBrazilian  (GUI Only)\r\nBulgarian  (GUI Only)\r\nCzech  (GUI Only)\r\nDanish  (GUI Only)\r\nDutch  (GUI Only)\r\nEnglish  (Full)\r\nFinnish  (GUI Only)\r\nFrench  (GUI Only)\r\nGerman  (GUI Only)\r\nGreek  (GUI Only)\r\nHungarian  (GUI Only)\r\nItalian  (GUI Only)\r\nJapanese  (GUI Only)\r\nKorean  (GUI Only)\r\nNorwegian  (GUI Only)\r\nPolish  (GUI Only)\r\nPortugeuse  (GUI Only)\r\nRomanian  (GUI Only)\r\nRussian  (GUI Only)\r\nSpanish  (GUI Only)\r\nSwedish  (GUI Only)\r\nChinese_simp  (GUI Only)\r\nChinese_trad  (GUI Only)\r\nThai  (GUI Only)\r\nTurkish  (GUI Only)\r\n\r\nLanguage choosing in installation process !!!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n=============\r\n\r\nTo install game use: Setup.exe\r\nAfter install run Updater.\r\n\r\nUpdate Game Support:\r\n====================\r\n\r\nIf you need udpating game run: Csgo_Updater.exe ... few minutes ... and thats all - complete :)\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions:\r\n==========================\r\n \nhttp://support.bruss.org.ru/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=1641\r\n\r\nCurrent Version:\r\n================\r\n\r\nProtocol version 13509\r\nExe version 1.35.0.9 (csgo)\r\nExe build: 13:42:50 Oct 14 2015 (6171) (730)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633a3a3edf24afaf0bbf37ae173b8222124f8f96","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike+Global+Offensive+v1.35.0.9+%2BAutoUpdate+%2BMultilang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633a3a3edf24afaf0bbf37ae173b8222124f8f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,58,58,62,223,36,175,175,11,191,55,174,23,59,130,34,18,79,143,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
