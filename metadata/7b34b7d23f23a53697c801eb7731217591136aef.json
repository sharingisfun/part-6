In response, the leader of KonohaÃ¢â‚¬â€œ the Fourth HokageÃ¢â‚¬â€œ sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the newborn Naruto Uzumaki. Konoha, however, regarded Naruto as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood. A decree made by the current Kage, the Third Hokage, forbade anyone mention the attack of the demon fox to anyone else. This included Naruto, who was not aware of the demon inside of him. Years later, Naruto is tricked by the renegade ninja Mizuki into stealing a forbidden scroll that would teach him a secret ninja technique, but he is stopped by his teacher, Iruka Umino. When Iruka almost dies while protecting Naruto from Mizuki, who also reveals that he is the container of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto uses the Jutsu he learned from the scroll that creates multiple clones of himself, Shadow Clone Technique, to defeat Mizuki.\n-------\n\nThank you for downloading :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b34b7d23f23a53697c801eb7731217591136aef","amp;dn":"Naruto+Season+1+%28Ep+1-35%29+Eng+Dub+480p+%5BCursator%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b34b7d23f23a53697c801eb7731217591136aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,52,183,210,63,35,165,54,151,200,1,235,119,49,33,117,145,19,106,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
