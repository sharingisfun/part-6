It is a book of sense and common sense, not only about magick but also about religion and one of the most critical issues of today: how to achieve the much-needed and wholesome relationship with our Earth. Cunningham presents Wicca as it is today: a gentle, Earth-oriented religion dedicated to the Goddess and God. Wicca also includes Cunningham's own Book of Shadows.\n\n01. - Section 1 - Theory - Wicca and Shamanism\n001. About the Audiobook and Dictionary\n002. Preface and Intro\n02. The Deities\n03.
