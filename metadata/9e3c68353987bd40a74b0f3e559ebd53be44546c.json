Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\nPOtHS - Gospel Music - 11 - WoW Gospel - 1998 thru 2011\n\nThese are Someones picks for the 30 Best Gospel Songs for each year, 13 in all. The only problem with me is that they cover to many genre of Gospel Music. They try to cover to big of Music Area, rather than focusing on one area. I think they should at least have 3 divisions maybe more. Then we could pick better. 50% of these songs I would not purchase just cause it ain't in my favorites. A lot of the Newer Music is for younger people that I just prefer not to listen too. All in all there is some Gospel for everyone. (I know how my Dad felt now when Jimi Hendrix came out)\n\nNew Orleans Jazz Festival\n\nI got to go 4 out of 7 days this years. It was a great time.\n\nLocal Favorites\nAmanda Shaw - Good Southern Girl\nJohn Boutte - Good Neighbor\n\nGospel Singers\n\n\nCanton Gospel Soul Children - Welcome to Canton\nConnie &amp; Dwight Fitch with The Family - Victory in Jesus\nNew Orleans Tribute to Mahalia Jackson - Cynthia Girtly &amp; Dr Michael White\nShades of Praise - God is Still Doing Great Things\nThe Electrifying Crown Seekers - Thank You For Saving Me\nThe Melody Clouds - Great Day\nThe Zion Harmonizers - The Best of New Orleans Gospel\n\nThere are also several hundred Festival Photos and some Short RAW Video Clips\n\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99 - The Biggest Conspiracy of all time. Solved\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99 - The Greatest Conspiracy of All Times - Solved\n- NO MORE DOUBTS - Coming Soon\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nThis is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
