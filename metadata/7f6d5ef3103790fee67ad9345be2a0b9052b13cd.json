Each chapter contains a brief lab to demonstrate the topic covered then moves on to the final part which combines the knowledge mastered by building a programmable robot (Arduino and Netduino). The companion disc includes videos of the labs, soldering skills, and code samples for programming of the robot.\r\n\r\nCovering both the theory and its practical application, this text leads the reader through the basic science concepts underlying electronics, building basic circuits, learning the roles of the components, the application of digital theory, and the possibilities for innovation by combining sensors, motors, and microcontrollers. The book includes appendices on mathematics for electronics, a timeline of electronics innovation, careers in electronics, and a glossary.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nIncludes a companion disc with eighteen video tutorials on currents, soldering, power supply, resistors, decoder circuits, and more\r\n\r\nLeads the reader through an introductory understanding of electronics with simple labs and then progressing to the construction of a microcontroller-driven robot using open source software and hardware (Netduino and Arduino versions)\r\n\r\nPresents theoretical concepts in a conversational tone, followed by hands-on labs to engage readers by presenting practical applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6d5ef3103790fee67ad9345be2a0b9052b13cd","amp;dn":"Basic+Electronics+-+Sean+Westcott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6d5ef3103790fee67ad9345be2a0b9052b13cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,109,94,243,16,55,144,254,230,122,217,52,91,226,160,185,5,43,19,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
