In our\nculture we always look on masks as something we hide behind but in a\nlot of other cultures there actually instruments you can be release\nthrough. I know there's a part of me which is naturally shy and\napologetic and I know that's devastatingly boring to watch so you know\nI want to get out of that..\n\nThe mask is the means to open up and express parts of yourself that\nare only hidden away and I think the performance gives me that.\n\nAre we sitting comfortably then I'll begin actually the way this goes\ntonight is in three parts it's a bit like a meal start off with the\nstarter and that's an acoustic bit so we play with the house lights\non with acoustic instruments a bit what we might do when working stuff\nout then we get onto the savoury course that's a bit more electronic\nlittle bit darker in flavour and if you survive that then you get to\ndesert which is the fall the full album from so top to bottom uninterrupted.....\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/57397094207789604880.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/57397094207789604880.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/92402090058198342889.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/92402090058198342889.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/27422483555031638488.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/27422483555031638488.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/08023702251615047790.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/08023702251615047790.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n:: Track List ::\n\n01 - Daddy Long Legs\n02 - Come Talk To Me\n03 - Shock The Monkey\n04 - Family Snapshot\n05 - Digging In The Dirt\n06 - Secret World\n07 - The Family And The Fishing Net\n08 - No Self Control\n09 - Solsbury Hill\n10 - Show Yourself\n11 - Red Rain\n12 - Sledgehammer\n13 - DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Give Up\n14 - That Voice Again\n15 - Mercy Street\n16 - Big Time\n17 - We Do What WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Told [MilgramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 37]\n18 - This Is The Picture [Excellent Birds]\n19 - In Your Eyes\n20 - The Tower That Ate People\n21 - Biko\n\n\n:: Personnel ::\n\nPeter Gabriel: Vocals, Keyboards\nTony Levin:  Bass\nDavid Rhodes:  Guitars\nDavid Sancious:  Keyboards\nManu KatchÃƒÂ©:  Drums\nJennie Abrahamson:  Vocals / Background Vocals\nLinnea Olsson:  Background Vocals\n\n:: General ::\n\nFormat: Matroska\nFile Size: 13.4 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 14.1 Mbps\nDuration: 2h 15mn\nSample: NO\nSubtitles: NO\n\n:: Video Info ::\n\nContainer: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 3 000 Kbps\nResolution: 1280 X 688 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 1.85:1\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n:: Audio Info ::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: DTS HD MA / PCM\nBitrate Mode: Variable / Constant\nBitrate 1: 1536 kbps ((( 6 channels )))\nBitrate 2: 4608 kbps ((( 2 Stereo )))\nSample Rate 1: 24 bits / 48kHz\nSample Rate 2: 24 bits / 96kHz\nChannel positions 1: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nChannel positions 2: L R\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0108450e586040e83cf0cf1ff788d51c47ee7bf","amp;dn":"Peter+Gabriel+-+Back+to+Front+%5B2014%5D+BDRip+720p+DTS-HD+MA+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0108450e586040e83cf0cf1ff788d51c47ee7bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,16,132,80,229,134,4,14,131,207,12,241,255,120,141,81,196,126,231,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
