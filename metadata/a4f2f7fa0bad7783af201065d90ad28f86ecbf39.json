Heartbreaking actual footage from factory farms, stockyards, and slaughterhouses is masterfully interwoven and juxtaposed with beautiful scenes from the sanctuary, as well as with rescue missions and intensely personal interviews with people who experienced first hand -- and ultimately rejected -- the painful realities of farm life. This film has the power to effect real change in people. Gather some friends and family to watch it, and by the end, there will not be a dry eye -- or untouched heart -- in the house.\n\n**********************************************\n\nYou can buy this DVD or other vegan goods from the following kickass online vegan shops! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.veganstore.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.veganstore.com&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Peaceable-Kingdom-Tribe-Heart-Documentary/dp/B00024ONCU\nhttp://www.veganessentials.com\nhttp://www.downbound.ca\nhttp://www.veganstore.co.uk\n\n**********************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f2f7fa0bad7783af201065d90ad28f86ecbf39","amp;dn":"Peaceable+Kingdom+-+Tribe+of+Heart+%282005.DVDRip.DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f2f7fa0bad7783af201065d90ad28f86ecbf39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,242,247,250,11,173,119,131,175,32,16,101,217,10,210,143,134,236,191,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
