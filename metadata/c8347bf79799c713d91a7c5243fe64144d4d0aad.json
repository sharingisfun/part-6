It was directed Robert Hamer, one of Ealing's most gifted filmmakers, who would direct some other notable films, such as Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), before alcohol addiction ruined his health and earned him a premature death.\n\nNo film depicts the post-war mood in Britain more effectively than It Always Rains on Sunday. Today, it is hard not to be struck by the film's bleak, almost cynical, tone and its complete lack of sentimentality. It serves as a useful social document to the mores and hardship of those grim years of privation and post-war disillusionment, where the scars of war - both physical and psychological - were all too apparent, and where criminality was running rampant in the ruins of a shattered society.\n\nThe evocative mood of this film is achieved largely through Douglas Slocombe's meticulous and atmospheric cinematography, which borrows from both French poetic realism and Italian neo-realism. This is particularly effective in the film's nail-biting conclusion - a dramatic nocturnal chase across a railway depot - which has a lush film noir look, which heightens the tension and shows just how tragically isolated the film's two protagonists have become now that Fate has decided to separate them forever.\n\nA tough-as-boots snapshot of post-war London. \n \nIt's a vivid, exciting snapshot of people going about their lives with a stoic hopefulness in the Age of Austerity, a now vanished world captured for ever in a film as good as, and arguably better than, anything comparable being made at the time on the continent\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.69gb\nDuration.... 01:31:33\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 976\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 2518kbps\nFrame Rate.... 24F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 120kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8347bf79799c713d91a7c5243fe64144d4d0aad","amp;dn":"Always+Rains+on+Sunday+1947+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8347bf79799c713d91a7c5243fe64144d4d0aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,52,123,247,151,153,199,19,217,26,124,82,67,254,100,20,77,77,10,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
