But I would love to one of many... homeschool is a COMPLETELY neglected category.\n\nMath Blaster 2 is the sequel to the fun, educational, and not to mention successful Math Blaster. The game is set in a fun Sci-Fi, futuristic world in which you are in space trying to defeat the mean enemies, while solving puzzles, and of course, learning Math the fun way. (Its sure beats the old fashioned Textbook :) )\n\nThe program works on basic math and puzzle skills by creating a futuristic space adventure that can only be won through the power of Math. Math Blaster 2 is good for children 6-12 years old.\n\nI recommend this game, because it will teach your children (or if you are a child, it will teach you) math by using a fun Sci-FI theme that will make your child (or you) want to learn more and more, and it almost never gets boring.\n\nFor Windows/Mac\n\nBrief description of this software product:\nBlasternaut and his pals play 4 different games in order to build the city. Math Problems are changeable to +,-,*,/, fractions, decimals, negatives and 2 and 3 operand formulas.\n\nThis program is appropriate for the following age groups:\nElementary School\n\nType of software:\nSoftware that Educates\nSoftware that Entertains\n\nKids will learn the following skills:\nMath, quick thinking \n\nCREATED WITH ULTRA ISO.  MOUNT TO VIRTUAL DRIVE OR BURN TO DISC.\n\nPLEASE SEED AND UPLOAD YOUR OWN HOMESCHOOL TORRENTS, WE ARE A NEGLECTED GROUP CURRENTLY!\n\nCEZEN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d063582946a4c5e0c8124de91df1d4a8f951323f","amp;dn":"Math+Blaster+2+Homeschool+Educational","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d063582946a4c5e0c8124de91df1d4a8f951323f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,99,88,41,70,164,197,224,200,18,77,233,29,241,212,168,249,81,50,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
