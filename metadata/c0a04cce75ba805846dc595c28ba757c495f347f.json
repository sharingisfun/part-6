A wildly hot and rockin' compilation that makes you wonder why his career ever had to informally wither away. Sure he's getting older, but this megastar will always know how to belt out the right tunes. This greatest hit package isn't something with a few favorites included. At least half a dozen Billboard inclusives are here on disc, making you wish your local rock DJ only had better common sense. TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE, I WANNA GO BACK, BABY HOLD ON, WALK ON WATER, TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT (BE MY BABY), PEACE IN OUR TIME and THINK I'M IN LOVE gets listeners feeling like music does have special meaning. These hits plus many others prompt you either to hug your loving gal to bits, gather with a group of buddies and a stack of cold beer, or have a fun time relaxing all on your own. Seem all too simple or fantasized to be legit? Eddie will sing it to ya... he'll let you know how to keep in control shakin' all night long, having a blast where the best parties get together and take action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a04cce75ba805846dc595c28ba757c495f347f","amp;dn":"Eddie+Money+Greatest+Hits+%5BFLAC%2BMP3%5D+The+Sound+of+Money","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a04cce75ba805846dc595c28ba757c495f347f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,160,76,206,117,186,128,88,70,220,89,92,40,186,117,124,73,95,52,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
