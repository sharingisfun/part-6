All operators, at all levels of licensure, need a basic understanding of arithmetic and problem-solving techniques to solve the problems they typically encounter in the workplace. Hailed on its first publication as a masterly account written in an engaging, highly readable, user-friendly style, the Mathematics Manual for Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators , Second Edition has been expanded and divided into three specialized texts that contain hundreds of worked examples presented in a step-by-step format. They are ideal for all levels of water treatment operators in training and practitioners studying for advanced licensure. In addition, they provide a handy desk reference and handheld guide for daily use in making operational math computations. This second volume, Water Treatment Operations: Math Concepts and Calculations , covers computations commonly used in water treatment with applied math problems specific to waterworks operations, allowing operators of specific unit processes to focus on their area of specialty. It explains calculations for pumping, water source and storage, coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination, fluoridation, and water softening. The text presents math operations that progressively advance to higher, more practical applications of mathematical calculations, including math operations that operators at the highest level of licensure would be expected to know and perform. To ensure correlation to modern practice and design, this volume provides illustrative problems for commonly used waterworks treatment operations found in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment facilities.\nAbout the Author\n\nFrank R. Spellman, PhD, is a retired assistant professor of environmental health at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, and the author of more than 90 books covering topics ranging from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to all areas of environmental science and occupational health. He consults on homeland security vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructures, including water/wastewater facilities, and conducts audits for Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency inspections throughout the country. Dr. Spellman lectures on sewage treatment, water treatment, and homeland security, as well as on safety topics, throughout the country and teaches water/wastewater operator short courses at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (7 May 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00KZ0N6LA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4668796eb36cee73fc2fb41a1d5b1873b4d89ce6","amp;dn":"%5BFrank+R.+Spellman+%5DMathematics+Manual+for+Water+and+Wastewater+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4668796eb36cee73fc2fb41a1d5b1873b4d89ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,104,121,110,179,108,238,115,252,47,180,26,29,91,24,115,180,216,156,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
