Disc 7 of 7 is at http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4325156\n\n-------------\n\nThe small file size is due to the use of the speech optimized codec Ogg Speex rather than MP3, and is not due to compromised quality. The drawback is limited support on mobile devices. If your device doesn't support Ogg Speex you can always reencode it to MP3. File size will increase sevenfold (assuming 128kbit) but you'll still get decent audio quality, and no gaps/jumps/spikes/other disturbances.\n\nMPlayer and VLC should work out of the box, for Windows Media Player download the Directshow Filters from http://www.illiminable.com/ogg\n\n----------------\n\nThe 4-Hour work Week: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Audio CD)\n\nTim Ferriss is an extraordinary young man on a mission. The twenty-eight-year-old serial vagabond and successful entrepreneur has been teaching a wildly popular course at Princeton University for the past four years--a how-to and why-to guide to throwing out the old tools and methods for success (balancing life and work, retiring well, having a great nest egg) and replacing them with a whole new way of living. Readers can lead a rich life by working only four hours a week, freeing up the rest of their time to spend it living the lives they want.\n\nTIM FERRISS has a diverse background of experience, including working as an actor, speaking seven foreign languages, holding a world record in tango, and being a national Chinese kickboxing champion. He has written for Maxim and the Philadelphia Inquirer, has appeared on MTV and CBS radio, and has been interviewed or featured in such major publications as the New York Times, LA Times, Parade, Cosmopolitan, Entrepreneur Magazine, and National Geographic Traveler.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Audio CD: 200 pages\n    * Publisher: Blackstone Audio Inc.; Unabridged edition (April 24, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0786158964\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0786158966\n\nWhether you're an overworked employee or an entrepreneur trapped in your own business, The 4-Hour Workweek is the compass for a new and revolutionary world.\n\nForget the old concept of retirement and the rest of the deferred-life plan?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³??????there is no need to wait and every reason not to.
