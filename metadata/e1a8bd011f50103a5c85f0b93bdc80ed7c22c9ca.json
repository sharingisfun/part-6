He achieved international recognition as an emblematic member of the Generation of '27.  He was executed by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThese two collections of GarcÃƒÂ­a Lorca's poetry feature English and Spanish texts on facing pages.  SELECTED POEMS covers all periods of the poet's life and gives equal space to the less well-known early poems.  At the same time key poems from all GarcÃƒÂ­a Lorca's collections are given, including the recently discovered &quot;Sonnets of Dark Love&quot;.  POET IN NEW YORK was written while GarcÃƒÂ­a Lorca was a student at Columbia University in 1929-30 and is one of the most important booksÃ‚Â he produced.  Indeed, it is a book that changed the direction of poetry in both Spain and the Americas, a pathbreaking and defining work of modern literature.\n\n\n* SELECTED POEMS (Oxford World's Classics, 2007).
