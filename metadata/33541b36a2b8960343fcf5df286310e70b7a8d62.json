In 2003, the album was ranked number 303 on Rolling Stone magazine\\&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, Mojo Magazine named Grace the #1 Modern Rock Classic of all Time.

It is currently certified 6x Platinum in Australia.\n\nA statement from the Buckley estate insists: Jeff Buckley\\&amp;#039;s death was not \\&quot;mysterious,\\&quot; related to drugs, alcohol, or suicide. We have a police report, a medical examiner\\&amp;#039;s report, and an eye witness to prove that it was an accidental drowning, and that Mr. Buckley was in a good frame of mind prior to the accident.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jeffbuckley.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jeffbuckley.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33541b36a2b8960343fcf5df286310e70b7a8d62","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+Grace+%281994%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33541b36a2b8960343fcf5df286310e70b7a8d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,84,27,54,162,184,150,3,67,252,245,223,40,99,16,231,11,122,141,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
