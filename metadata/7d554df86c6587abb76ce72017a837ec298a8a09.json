This VTC QuickStart! course will show you how to create a responsive website using the integrated functions that come with Adobe's Dreamweaver CS6. Author Mark Struthers will cover the issues that are present with a traditional fixed width, non-responsive website. Then he will show you how to create a static website using an extension made by WebAssist that can subsequently be developed when CSS rules and media queries are later applied. The Fluid Grid Layout function within Dreamweaver CS6 is also explored so that experienced Dreamweaver users (who may be new to responsive website design) can use the resulting fluid grid template, populated with assets of their own, to build a fully functioning responsive site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d554df86c6587abb76ce72017a837ec298a8a09","amp;dn":"VTC-QuickStart%21+-+Responsive+Dreamweaver+CS6+Websites+Course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d554df86c6587abb76ce72017a837ec298a8a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,85,77,248,108,101,135,171,183,108,231,32,23,168,55,236,41,138,138,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
