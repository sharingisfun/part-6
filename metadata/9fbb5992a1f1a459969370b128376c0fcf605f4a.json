PFD ONLY.\n\nStephen King returns to the character and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance and the very special twelve-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.\n\nOn highways across America, a tribe of people called the True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmlessÃ¢â‚¬â€mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, the True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the steam that children with the shining produce when they are slowly tortured to death.\n\nHaunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel, where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant shining power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doctor Sleep.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThen Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own demons and summons him to a battle for AbraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of The Shining and satisfy anyone new to this icon in the King canon.\n\nEPUB,MOBI AND TXT.
