It was recorded in two weeks at several locations in London and Kent during 2008 and was produced by Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee. Inspired by the release options available in the Internet age, the band members made the album available for purchase on their website as a digital download on 21 August 2008. Minimal promotion was undertaken in the UK. The record was released in compact disc form on 24 October 2008, with Wichita Recordings as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the Billboard 200 in the United States at number 18. Bloc Party wanted to create an album that further distanced the band from the traditional rock set-up by incorporating more electronic elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of frontman Kele Okereke's break-ups in 2007. Three songs were released as singles: &quot;Mercury&quot;, &quot;Talons&quot;, and &quot;One Month Off&quot;; the first two tracks entered the UK Top 40. Intimacy was generally well received by critics. Reviewers often focused on its rush-release and central theme, and considered them either bold steps or poor choices.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Ares\n[02] Mercury\n[03] Halo\n[04] Biko\n[05] Trojan Horse\n[06] Signs\n[07] One Month Off\n[08] Zephyrus\n[09] Talons\n[10] Better Than Heaven\n[11] Ion Square\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:48m:00s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 117mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
