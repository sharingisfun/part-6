The series features the eponymous owl, pink in colour, and with blue feet that &quot;float&quot; below her body. Each of the minute-long fifty-two episodes centres on the owl attempting to overcome unfortunate circumstances (sometimes created by her negative attitude and antisocial behavior), but end in her demise by her various appendages and body being dispensed of in unusual or comical ways. The series also feature a surrealistic world with floating objects and exploding apples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b1734ee8b17df8003fc6ca688ccbbdf766cc94","amp;dn":"The+Owl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b1734ee8b17df8003fc6ca688ccbbdf766cc94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,177,115,78,232,177,125,248,0,63,198,202,104,140,203,189,247,102,204,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
