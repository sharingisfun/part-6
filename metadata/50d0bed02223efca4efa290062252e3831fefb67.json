Gregor is a soldier who is about to embark on a mission to Afghanistan and Ziva is going to study abroad. Andrej is their gay friend who hates everything, himself included. They decide to go to a road trip to the seaside like they did when they were in high school. When they arrive, they get drunk and Ziva and Gregor kiss each other, what brings tension to their relationship, while Andrej doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know anything and just makes fun of everything, mostly of Gregor and his army ideals. The conflict erupts when Ziva, in a fit of rage, destroys their tent and tells a secret that enrages Andrej. Only then the true problem is revealed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ziva is not going to study abroad, she was lying because she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to pity her.\n\nRip Specs\n\nFile Name .........................................: Izlet.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,159,221,248 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:21:48\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1687 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.234 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956534/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956534/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSlovenian audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by exvet, whom we thank\n\nNejc Gazvoda - Izlet (2011)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d0bed02223efca4efa290062252e3831fefb67","amp;dn":"Nejc+Gazvoda+-+Izlet+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d0bed02223efca4efa290062252e3831fefb67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,208,190,208,34,35,239,202,78,250,41,0,98,37,46,56,49,254,251,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
