Peaceful. Everyone shares. When the people work together, for the people, it is only then that everything starts to work. This is why Linux excels over Windows, Firefox over Internet Explorer, and ThePirateBay over Amazon or other so-called 'e-book libraries' where information and education is restricted to only the rich. Education should be for everyone, I believe we can accomplish this, one seed at a time, we will plant the tree of knowledge, the fruits of which our children shall consume :)\n\n\nThis book is wonderful!\n\nDon't take my word? Fine, how about take the word of his editor instead?\n\n&quot;Prior to 1998, Gevin Giorbran authored three books in which he described in detail how our universe eventually ends, as space expands perfectly flat and time reaches absolute zero. In 1998, when astrophysicists discovered the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating towards perfectly flat space, Gevin started work on the book you see before you now. Prior to his death he asked that I, Rob Bryanton, takeover the sale and promotion of his work. The ideas in this E-book took Gevin through almost ten years of research, writing and polishing, and a lifetime dedicated to the pursuit of this knowledge, to arrive at what you see before you. This pdf file has no copy protection on it [but he was still a greedy asshole about it, taking down sites holding the pdf and shit] because my main interest is in getting these important and groundbreaking ideas out into the world. If you would like to own this book in either hard cover or paperback, or buy other products related to this project, please visit www.tenthdimension.com/store . Or if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to download your own copy of this pdf, please go to www.tenthdimension.com/digital . Enjoy the journey! Profits from the sale of GevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work will go to the Gevin Giorbran Memorial Fund.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261698850ada138a95fd591c848628854daf8564","amp;dn":"Everything+is+Forever%2C+learning+to+see+timelessness+-+Gevin+Gior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261698850ada138a95fd591c848628854daf8564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,22,152,133,10,218,19,138,149,253,89,28,132,134,40,133,77,175,133,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
