Cat: Keeping Peace When You Have More Than One Cat by Pam Johnson-Bennett\nEnglish | 2004 | ISBN: 0142004758 | 240 pages | EPUB | 503 KB\n\n\nIn this companion to her successful introduction to cat behavior Think Like a Cat, Pam Johnson-Bennett, the award-winning author and feline behaviorist, shows how adding another cat to your home does not have to be the start of a kitty apocalypse. Although cats are often misunderstood as natural loners, Johnson-Bennett shows how to plan, set up, and maintain a home environment that will help multiple catsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their ownersÃ¢â‚¬â€live in peace. Cat vs. Cat will help readers understand the importance of territory, the specialized communication cats use to establish relationships and hierarchies, and how to interpret the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad behaviorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that leads so many owners to needless frustration. Offering a wealth of information on how to diffuse tension, prevent squabbles and ambushes, blend two families, or help the elder kitty in your family, Cat vs. Cat is a welcome resource for both seasoned and prospective guardians of cat families large and small.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZfHCNOF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZfHCNOF.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e41d552b62dd403fe02dee2d31443afc060442d","amp;dn":"Cat+Vs.+Cat%3A+Keeping+Peace+When+You+Have+More+Than+One+Cat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e41d552b62dd403fe02dee2d31443afc060442d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,65,213,82,182,45,212,3,254,2,222,226,211,20,67,175,192,96,68,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
