You actually do get two hours and 20 minutes of Renaissance music performed so exquisitely, so correctly, and so passionately that it's as if an entire era in music makes itself understood through these CDs. \n\nThe Tallis Scholars are as good as it gets in this repertoire. In addition to getting Allegri's gorgeous Miserere, you'll find Thomas Tallis's 40-part Spem in alium, some wonderfully weird and dissonant Responsories by Gesualdo, Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli (the &quot;how-to&quot; piece of the Renaissance popes, who demanded that the words be understood), and various other works. \n\n'This stuff is like a finely woven tapestry and should be listened to bits at a time, it's amazingly rich and worth it.' --Robert Levine\n\n2 CDs. EAC-&gt;FLAC, cues, logs. Complete scans\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccde0511fe210c4510f0b25e5f3d50b907f1d53","amp;dn":"The+Tallis+Scholars+-+The+Best+of+the+Renaissance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccde0511fe210c4510f0b25e5f3d50b907f1d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,205,224,81,31,226,16,196,81,15,11,37,229,243,213,11,144,127,29,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
