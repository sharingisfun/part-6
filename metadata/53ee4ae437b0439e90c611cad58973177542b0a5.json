Ward\nNarrated by: Jim Frangione\nLength: 22 hrs and 8 mins\n\nSeries: Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 13\n\nUnabridged Audiobook\n\nTwo brothers bound by more than blood discover a conspiracy that will change their destiny in the astonishing all-new novel of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, the &quot;frighteningly addictive&quot; (Publishers Weekly) series by number-one New York Times best-selling author J. R. Ward.\n\nWarnings from the customer reviews ... apparently this late in the series JR Ward and Jim Frangione consulted and made changes to the pronunciation of names based on her intentions versus what he had been using for the narrations on previous books. Many customers found these late date changes upsettingly distracting.\n\nThat being said, the story itself is up to par with the rest of the series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53ee4ae437b0439e90c611cad58973177542b0a5","amp;dn":"J+R+Ward+-+Black+Dagger+Brotherhood+13+-+The+Shadows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53ee4ae437b0439e90c611cad58973177542b0a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,238,74,228,55,176,67,158,144,198,17,202,213,137,115,23,117,66,176,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
