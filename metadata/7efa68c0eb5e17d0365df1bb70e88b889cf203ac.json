With the guidance of Serina, a spirited artificial intelligence (A.I.) persona, direct legions of UNSC soldiers, Warthogs, Scorpions, and more, each group having its own strengths and uses in battle. Adventurous commanders can also call upon ancient Forerunner technology, if they are fortunate enough to find it hidden throughout the battlefield.\n\nIn campaign mode, command the armies of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire, with familiar and new UNSC units in its initial encounters against the Covenant, an alien coalition threatening to obliterate mankind. Covenant forces are also waiting for you to lead them into battle in multiplayer skirmishes via the New Xbox Experience. Call upon an arsenal of new and familiar Covenant units such as Grunts, Elites, Ghosts, and even Scarabs to defeat foes on the battlefield.\t\n\n\nThis game is stealth patched and the torrent includes the .iso and .dvd files\n\nI have tested these files on the 1.51 firmware and verified stealth through two softwares.\n\nJust open the .dvd file in a common mounting tool and burn (2.4x) and you'll be playing in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\nREMEMBER TO SEED!!!!!
