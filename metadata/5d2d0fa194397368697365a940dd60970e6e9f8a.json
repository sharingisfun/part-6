The\npocket atlas is meant as a companion to lectures. It also serves as a valuable\norientation tool for coursework in microscopic anatomy. More than ever before,\nhistology plays a very important role in medicine and biology. Therefore,\nthe short instructive texts have been updated so that they incorporate\nthe latest scientific findings. An understanding of micromorphological techniques\nis a prerequisite for the study of biochemistry, physiology and the\nrelatively young discipline of molecular cell biology. Accordingly, cytology\nand histology rank high in the curriculum.\nThis pocket atlas does not attempt to provide a complete theoretical knowledge\nof histology, which may be approached using comprehensive works on\ncytology, histology and microscopic anatomy. It rather conveys a basic\nunderstanding of the elements in histology and the microscopic anatomy of\nthe human body. Students of histology will value this pocket atlas as a course\ncompanion book while using microscopic techniques. The atlas will help\nthem to recognize the crucial elements and structures in a histological image\nand make it easier to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\nYou will find 16 tables in the appendix. Students have suggested this addition.\nWith the help of these tables, students can test their ability to recognize\nand interpret the relevant structures in histological images.\nThe intuitive layout of the current edition makes it easy to find references.\nMany new images have been added.\n\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b8d5cdd0d9d5d5d9dc96cfd9c9d9ca96d9dadad9cbf8d4d1cedd96dbd7d5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d2d0fa194397368697365a940dd60970e6e9f8a","amp;dn":"Color+atlas+of+cytology%2C+histology+and+microscopic+anatomy+%28Kueh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d2d0fa194397368697365a940dd60970e6e9f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,45,15,161,148,57,115,104,105,115,101,169,64,221,96,151,14,110,159,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
