Howard - the creator of Conan the Barbarian, and contemporary and collaborator with H.P. Lovecraft. The film is based off the book by the only woman that Howard is known to have had a serious relationship with - this somewhat limits the scope to her experiences and knowledge of him. That said, there were not many who knew Howard who put their perpectives down on paper for posterity, so this may be the only glimpse we ever get into the real life of this immortal fantasist.\n\nStarring Vincent D&amp;#039;Onofrio as Robert E. Howard, Renee Zellweger as Novalyne Price.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118163/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118163/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/Whole_wide_world_1996.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/Whole_wide_world_1996.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973eb6f60bc2107592af4c241975e9b6152607da","amp;dn":"The+Whole+Wide+World+1996+%5BHoneyko%5D+Conan+Barbarian+related+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973eb6f60bc2107592af4c241975e9b6152607da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,62,182,246,11,194,16,117,146,175,76,36,25,117,233,182,21,38,7,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
