The objective of most authors is to get rid of the negative truths about man as given by God in His Book. In this work, Dr. Ruckman lays out exactly what the Scriptures say about manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition and how all positive approaches by men to change that end in either abject failure, death, Hell, or all three. Only the intervention of God can save man, whether you are talking individually or as a whole. In a day when positive thinking is considered a dogma of humanity, it is necessary to have a work like this that presents proper Biblical discernment.\n\n\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fd3ea3a3df8f11fba0292a5d184eecdab4cdc5","amp;dn":"The+Power+Of+Negative+Thinking+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fd3ea3a3df8f11fba0292a5d184eecdab4cdc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,253,62,163,163,223,143,17,251,160,41,42,93,24,78,236,218,180,205,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
