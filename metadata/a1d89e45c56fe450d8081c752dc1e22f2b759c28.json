Slans are usually shot on sight, but that doesn't stop Jommy's mother from bringing him to see the world capital of Centropolis, the seat of power for Earth's dictator, Kier Gray. But on their latest trip to Centropolis, the two slans are discovered, and Jommy's mother is killed. Jommy, only 9 years old, unwittingly becomes caught up in a plot to undermine Gray, who may be more sympathetic to slans than the public suspects.\n\nThe nonstop action and root-for-the-underdog plot has made Slan a science fiction favorite.\n\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\n[tape rip]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d89e45c56fe450d8081c752dc1e22f2b759c28","amp;dn":"A.E.+van+Vogt+-+Slan+%28Slan+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d89e45c56fe450d8081c752dc1e22f2b759c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,216,158,69,197,111,228,80,216,8,28,117,45,193,226,47,43,117,156,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
