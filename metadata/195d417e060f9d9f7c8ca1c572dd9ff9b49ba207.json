Created by Jonathan Ames, the series follows a writer, named Jonathan Ames, based in Brooklyn who moonlights as an unlicensed private detective. Advertisements have described Bored to Death as a &quot;Noir-otic comedy&quot;. It airs Sundays at 9:30pm EST.\n\nAlthough it is loosely based in Carroll Gardens, the series is shot primarily on location in the nearby neighborhood of Fort Greene.\n\nHBO has renewed the comedy for a second season.
