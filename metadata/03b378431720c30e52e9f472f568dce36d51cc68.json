She was awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin American world.&quot;\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known Latin American poets of her time, Gabriela -- as she was admiringly called all over the Hispanic world -- embodied in her person, as much as in her works, the cultural values and traditions of a continent that had not been recognized until then with the most prestigious international literary prize.  &quot;It is to render homage to the riches of Spanish American literature that we address ourselves today especially to its queen, the poet of 'DesolaciÃ³n' [1922], who has become the great singer of mercy and motherhood,&quot; concludes the citation read at the Nobel Prize ceremony.\r\n\r\nOwing to the suicide of her lover, Mistral never married, and a haunting, wistful strain of thwarted maternal tenderness informs her poetry.  Her later work evidences a broader interest in humanity, but love of children and of the downtrodden remained her principal themes.  Her extraordinarily passionate verse, which is frequently coloured by figures and words peculiarly her own, is marked by warmth of feeling and emotional power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\r\n\r\n* Crickets and Frogs: A Fable (Atheneum, 1957).
