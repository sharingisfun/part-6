Release: 2007. Remastered.\n\n\nCountry music doesn't get any more essential than this. The five-disc box set SHE THINKS I STILL CARE is undoubtedly the most awe-inspiring George Jones collection to date. Jones was at his peak during his 1962-'64 stint on the UA label, and some of his most unforgettable recordings hail from this era. You get much more on this set than mere timeless, undeniable gems such as &quot;The Race is On,&quot; &quot;She Thinks I Still Care,&quot; and &quot;Let's Invite Them Over,&quot; though.\n\nFrom heartbroken Hank Williams tributes like &quot;Take These Chains From My Heart&quot; to the spiritual intensity of &quot;Kneel at the Feet of Jesus&quot; and a generous helping of Jones legendary duets with Melba Montgomery (easily on a par with his Tammy Wynette collaborations), this set gives us a full picture of the man's artistry. And with five discs worth of tracks, you couldn't ask for more comprehensive coverage of this era. You can get the aforementioned hits on a million best-of packages, it's the rest of the story that makes SHE THINKS I STILL CARE such an outstanding musical document.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d04a92fdb26e7d84353b625917f5c61c90b0fb48","amp;dn":"George+Jones+-+She+Thinks+I+Still+Care+%5B1962-1964%5D+Bear+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d04a92fdb26e7d84353b625917f5c61c90b0fb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,74,146,253,178,110,125,132,53,59,98,89,23,245,198,28,144,176,251,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
