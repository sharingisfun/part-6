The actual artist name and album title are ambiguous; releases, reviews, and even the official artist and label websites use &quot;Black Devil&quot; and &quot;Black Devil Disco Club&quot; interchangeably.Songwriting credits on the EP named Junior Claristidge and Joachim Sherylee, aliases for Bernard Fevre and Jacky Giordano, respectively. In a 2007 interview, Fevre explained that Giordano's role wasn't musical, he just financed the recordings, and the co-writing credit was a way of recouping that investment. The 1978 EP was reissued in 2004 on the Rephlex label. Collectors unaware of the original LP release initially speculated that the reissue was a hoax by Rephlex founders.\n\nThe reissue press release read as follows:   &quot;Originally released on Out Records way back in 1978, Black DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDisco ClubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an extremely rare disco masterpiece, an epic journey into the deepest electronic disco ... The record was discovered by RephlexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own PP Roy for 20 pence at a car boot sale, and quickly found favour with friends Richard D. James and Luke Vibert. The record has received heavy road testing from Richard and Luke, and original copies are on the net for up to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200... Keen as ever to share fantastic music, label co-founder Grant Wilson-Claridge has managed to secure the exclusive license for Rephlex, unwittingly beating Metro AreaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Morgan Geist (a long time fan) to the snap! It was made manually in a recording studio in the suburbs of Paris using synths and occasional tape loops and a drummer: no midi or computers.&quot;\n\n\nThere are some acts so thrillingly obscure and mysterious that to embrace them takes a certain leap of faith. In fact, the lack of a paper trail becomes part of the fun.\n\nAccording to what little lore exists, Black Devil is the French duo Bernard Fevre and Jackie Giordano. Or maybe that's spelled Jacky Giordano, as he was credited on the group's 1978 EP, along with Joachim Sherylee and Junior Claristidge, who may (or may not) be made-up, or possible pseudonyms of Fevre and Giordano. Until now, that EP was the only known document of the group's existance. Titled Disco Club (that is, assuming it wasn't a self-titled release by Black Devil Disco Club all along, to whom this disc is credited), it was initially released to little fanfare, but has steadily gained notoriety and recognition since its original issue. And rightly so: Its few spooky tracks of European electro-disco were brilliant enough to have supposedly influenced and inspired throngs of italo-disco and dance artists over the years.\n\nOf course, the disc was a well-kept secret, until some deep cratedigging led the Chemical Brothers to sample a Black Devil track called &quot;Earthmessage&quot; on &quot;Got Glint?&quot; from their 1999 Surrender disc. And a few years later, in 2004, the first and only Black Devil Disco Club EP was parceled out via a series of 12&quot;s by Rephlex, leading some to wonder whether the whole thing was just an elaborate ruse perpetrated by label co-founder Aphex Twin, who, as everybody knows, has nothing better to do than to prank his fans.\n\nFast forward two more years and a six-song disc has appeared credited to Black Devil Disco Club, titled 28 Later. Is this the same Black Devil from 1978, twenty-eight years later? The copyright reads 2006, but the only credit on the jacket notes &quot;All Titles Written &amp; Produced by Bernard Fevre.&quot; OK, but written and produced when? 1978? 1983? 2005? The eerily timeless disc could have been produced in any of those eras, as it propels itself along on a familiar and formula of analog synths, Giorgio Moroder-styled pulse/throb basslines, simple drum machine patterns, pitter-pattering faux bongo beats, and someone (Fevre?) singing heavily processed vocals and wordless gibberish.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic/Dance\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tRCA \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.H Friend\n02.Timing, Forget The Timing\n03.One To Choose\n04.We Never Fly Away Again\n05.Follow Me (Instrumental)\n06.No Regrets\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6af80782440f12acfa5ade92534fc2445b9c8c","amp;dn":"Black+Devil+-+Disco+Club+RCA+PL+37164+%281978%29+RARE+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6af80782440f12acfa5ade92534fc2445b9c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,106,248,7,130,68,15,18,172,250,90,222,146,83,79,194,68,91,156,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
