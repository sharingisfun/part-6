Over the last 100 years, Sicilians have seen their beautiful island sink under the weight of corruption, recession and the mafia. But today, Sicily is experiencing a renaissance and celebrating a rediscovery of their unique ancient heritage. Andrew and Giorgio visit Mount Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe, and explore the rich vegetation of its foothills and the dramatic moonlike craters of its upper slopes. Etna truly is a great beauty with a seductive dark side, just like Sicily. During this journey our presenters will meet the ordinary people really trying to make a difference in Sicily. Ciccio the fisherman who retrieved a statue dating back 2300 years from the sea. Called the Dancing Satyr, rather than sell it to a private art dealer, he generously gave it back to his town so that his fellow Sicilians can enjoy the riches of their past. \nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/623/sicilyunpackedscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/623/sicilyunpackedscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5323/sicilyunpackedscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5323/sicilyunpackedscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8204/sicilyunpackedscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8204/sicilyunpackedscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4378/sicilyunpackedscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4378/sicilyunpackedscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3639/sicilyunpackedscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3639/sicilyunpackedscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5389/sicilyunpackedscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5389/sicilyunpackedscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/719/sicilyunpackedscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/719/sicilyunpackedscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3900/sicilyunpackedscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3900/sicilyunpackedscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7296/sicilyunpackedscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7296/sicilyunpackedscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1640 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f94a82b1a920cd75cc0dd0e6581685230cbb310","amp;dn":"BBC+Sicily+Unpacked+3of3+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f94a82b1a920cd75cc0dd0e6581685230cbb310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,148,168,43,26,146,12,215,92,192,221,14,101,129,104,82,48,203,179,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
