Friday Night Dinner is\n                a truly original series about the Goodmans, a family\n                who have made an art form of their eccentricities. In\n                the second episode, when Adam and Jonny come home to\n                find Dad secretly peering into his underpants with a\n                magnifying glass, they're desperate to find out what\n                he's looking at. Meanwhile, Mum is just trying to\n                have a nice Friday night, but Jim - the neighbour\n                who's terrified of his own dog - keeps interrupting\n                the meal. Dad takes Adam - who's single - into the\n                toilet to have a private chat about 'females'. Soon\n                the whole family are in the loo quizzing poor Adam.\n                Jonny is loving it. And finally, the secret behind\n                Dad's pants-peering is revealed.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cdaf68563721e57fff9a56b724f71fcccf3368e","amp;dn":"Friday.Night.Dinner.S01E02.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cdaf68563721e57fff9a56b724f71fcccf3368e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,218,246,133,99,114,30,87,255,249,165,107,114,79,113,252,204,243,54,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
