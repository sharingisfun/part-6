Orlac (Conrad Veidt) is a famous pianist whose handsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the tools of his trade and his wife Ivana's (Alexandra Sorina) favorite part of his bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are mangled in a horrific train wreck.\n\nThe film is full of castration imagery, Freudian intimations (including a patriarchal ogre in a twisted castle), and assorted perversities (like the wife's erotic yearning to be touched), yet next to the relentlessly distorted subjectivity of Caligari, Wiene's handling here seems almost minimalist, keeping the camera angles mostly balanced as the horrors materialize through stark atmosphere and Veidt's extraordinary physical expressiveness. Paced like a funeral and saddled with one of the least satisfying endings in German expressionism, Orlac scarcely reaches the baroque complexities of The Man Who Laughs (where it was Veidt's grin, rather than his mitts, that tortured him). Nevertheless, it lingers as a unique waking nightmare both in the viewer's mind and in film history: He may have started a long line of unruly-appendage shocks (from the 1935 MGM remake Mad Love to the slapstick splatter of Evil Dead 2), but Wiene's greatest contribution was imagining, decades before Cronenberg, the ultimate horror of the body turning against itself.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/4-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/4-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/9d-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/9d-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/1-6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii2/mteste/1-6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------not my rip--------\n\n~~~~~~ Orlacs Hande.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,231,134,720                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:52:44                \nFrame Count:....................................121622             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................17.982          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1257                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP..................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.228&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n\n       *****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
