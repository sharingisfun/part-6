Hirschman goes on to explain that by understanding the relationship between exit and voice, and the interplay that loyalty has with these choices, organizations can craft the means to better address their members' concerns and issues, and thereby effect improvement. \nAlso included are two follow-up works:\nExit, Voice and the State\nExit, Voice, and Loyalty - Further Reflections and a Survey of Recent Contributions\n\nThe Rhetoric of Reaction - Perversity, Futility, Jeopardy\nIn this book, Hirschman argues that the rhetoric of conservativism in opposition to social change consists of three narratives: perversity, futility, and jeopardy, and that, further, these narratives are simplistic and flawed, and cut off debate. Hirschman illustrates this thesis with examples from the French revolution and 19th and 20th centuries. He then discusses corresponding progressive narratives, and proposes a new framework.\n\n\nThe Principle of the Hiding Hand\nIn which Hirschman introduces the Hiding Hand Principle: the idea that when a person decides to take on a project, the ignorance of future obstacles allows the person to rationally choose to undertake the project, and once it is underway the person will utilize his creativity to overcome the obstacles he encounters because it is too late to abandon the project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d3d7b2a0de0269b244286573babaeace1a1c95","amp;dn":"Albert+Hirschman+-+Books+and+Articles+%286+files%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d3d7b2a0de0269b244286573babaeace1a1c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,211,215,178,160,222,2,105,178,68,40,101,115,186,186,234,206,26,28,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
