The three members were barely out of their teens when they became a musical sensation in 1972, scoring No. 1 hits and winning a Grammy for best new musical artist. Their recording success stretched throughout the 1970s; some of their best known songs are &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; (both of which reached No. 1), &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;, and &quot;Lonely People&quot;. George Martin produced seven of their albums.\n\nPeek left the group in 1977 to pursue a solo career, but Beckley and Bunnell returned to the top 10 as a duo with &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; in 1982. As late as 2009, America performed over 100 shows per year.\n\nOn January 16, 2007, America released Here &amp; Now, the band's first major label studio album in over twenty years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmerica is the eponymous debut album by America, released in 1971. It was initially released without &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, which had not yet been recorded.

It produced two hit singles; &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; spent three weeks at #1 on the Billboard singles chart in 1972 (it peaked at #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart), and &quot;I Need You&quot; hit #9 on the Billboard singles chart and #7 on the AC chart. Several other songs received radio airplay on FM stations playing album tracks, including &quot;Sandman&quot; (long rumoured in the US Navy to be about the VQ-2 air squadron formerly based in Rota, Spain)[citation needed] and &quot;Three Roses&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of one million units in the US.\n\n\nBand:\n\nDewey Bunnell: lead and backing vocals, 6-string acoustic guitar (except on &quot;Here&quot; and &quot;Never Found the Time&quot;)\n\nGerry Beckley: bass (except on &quot;Three Roses&quot; and &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;), 6 and 12-string acoustic guitars (except on &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Pigeon Song&quot;), lead and backing vocals (except on &quot;Pigeon Song&quot;), electric guitar and chimes on &quot;Clarice&quot;, piano on &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Clarice&quot;\n\nDan Peek: 6 and 12-string acoustic guitars (except on &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;Clarice&quot; and &quot;Pigeon Song&quot;), lead and backing vocals (except on &quot;Pigeon Song&quot;), electric guitar (on &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot;), piano on &quot;Never Found the Time&quot;, bass on &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; and &quot;Three Roses&quot;\n\nRay Cooper: percussion\n\nDave Atwood: drums on &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;Here&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot;\n\nKim Haworth: drums on &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;\n\nDavid Lindley: electric guitar on &quot;Children&quot;, steel guitar on &quot;Rainy Day&quot;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHomecoming is a 1972 album by America.
