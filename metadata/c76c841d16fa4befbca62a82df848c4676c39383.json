For each area studied there are only so many questions an examiner can ask; they are presented here with clear explanations that allow the student to revise thoroughly one topic at a time. \n\nWhile doing so the student can also practise their exam technique. Each book includes MCQs, EMQs, SAQs and Problem-based Questions - exactly the kind of questions they will get in their exams.\n\nIllustrated with simple, easy-to-reproduce line drawings, medical students have in this one volume all that they need for exam success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76c841d16fa4befbca62a82df848c4676c39383","amp;dn":"One+Stop+Doc+Immunology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76c841d16fa4befbca62a82df848c4676c39383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,108,132,29,22,250,75,239,188,166,42,130,223,132,140,70,118,195,147,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
