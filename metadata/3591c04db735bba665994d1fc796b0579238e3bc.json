Each age has a unique characteristic pattern of crime. In the past three centuries crime has changed and evolved until the sex killer and the mass murderer have become symbols of all that is worst about our civilization. But this is not just a study in human depravity; it is an attempt to place crime in perspective against human discovery, exploration and invention. The result is a completely new approach to the history and psychology of human violence.\nGenre: Psychology and Behavior","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3591c04db735bba665994d1fc796b0579238e3bc","amp;dn":"A+Criminal+History+of+Mankind+by+Colin+Wilson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3591c04db735bba665994d1fc796b0579238e3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,145,192,77,183,53,187,166,101,153,77,31,199,150,176,87,146,56,227,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
