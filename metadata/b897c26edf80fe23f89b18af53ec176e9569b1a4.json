Though women will find useful information here, men seem to be the main audience for this book, that is men serious enough about their hard body to endure a regimen of supplements, a strict meal plan and several weeks of high-intensity workouts. Students of fitness science will have the chance to learn all about things like &quot;Positive Nitrogen Balance,&quot; &quot;The Anabolic State&quot; and the &quot;Lactic Acid System.&quot; \n Formulas are provided to calculate recommended daily calories, target heart rate during workouts and current muscle-to-fat percentage. Exercises and stretches come with pictures and drawings to demonstrate, and a daily exercise checklist and food journal demand accountability. The fact that Shilstone can take credit for the athletic bods of heavyweight champion Michael Spinks, NBA star Manute Bol and baseball legend Brett Butler proves his techniques are sound. But his writing doesn't serve to entertain, and his textbooklike tone makes reading a chore.\n\n============================================\n\nThe 8 Colors of Fitness\n\nSuzanne Brue\n2008\nEnglish \nISBN: 0979562503  \n204 pages \n3.10 MB\n\nThe 8 Colors of Fitness: Discover Your Color-Coded Fitness Personality and Create an Exercise Program You'll Never Quit!
