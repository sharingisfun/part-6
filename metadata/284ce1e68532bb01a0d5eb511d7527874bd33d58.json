Others must be put down. Just ask Anita Blake.\n\nBefore now, she would have considered them merely off-putting, never dangerous. Before now, she had never heard of any of them causing human beings to perish in agony. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all changed.\n\nMicah's estranged father lies dying, rotting away inside from some strange ailment that has his doctors whispering about &quot;zombie disease&quot;.\n\nAnita makes her living off of zombies - but these arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the kind she knows so well. These creatures hunt in daylight, and are as fast and strong as vampires. If they bite you, you become just like them. And round and round it goes....\n\nWhere will it stop?\n\nEven Anita Blake doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know.\n\n\n\nFrom my first conversions from audible aa format to mp3 - \nConverted using SoundTaxi 128kbps - \nI checked the beginning and end of each file to make sure the conversion was complete - please let me know if there are any issues.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284ce1e68532bb01a0d5eb511d7527874bd33d58","amp;dn":"Laurell+K.+Hamilton+-+Affliction+Anita+Blake+Book+22+Unabridged+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284ce1e68532bb01a0d5eb511d7527874bd33d58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,76,225,230,133,50,187,1,160,213,235,81,29,117,39,135,75,211,61,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
