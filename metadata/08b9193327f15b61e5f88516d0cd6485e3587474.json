Rush knew it was now or never with their fourth release, and they delivered just in time -- 1976's 2112 proved to be their much sought-after commercial breakthrough and remains one of their most popular albums. Instead of choosing between prog rock and heavy rock, both styles are merged together to create an interesting and original approach. The entire first side is comprised of the classic title track, which paints a chilling picture of a future world where technology is in control (Peart's lyrics for the piece being influenced by Ayn Rand). Comprised of seven &quot;sections,&quot; the track proved that the trio members were fast becoming rock's most accomplished instrumentalists. The second side contains shorter selections, such as the Middle Eastern-flavored &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot; and the album-closing rocker &quot;Something for Nothing.&quot; 2112 is widely considered by Rush fans as their first true &quot;classic&quot; album, the first in a string of similarly high-quality albums.
