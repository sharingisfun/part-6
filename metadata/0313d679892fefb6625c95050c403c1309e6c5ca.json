Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec,[4] Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband RenÃƒÂ© AngÃƒÂ©lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record.[5] In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.[6]\n\nDion had first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland.[7][8] Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of AngÃƒÂ©lil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history.[9][10] However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer.[10][11] She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada.[12][13][14]\n\nDion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&amp;B to gospel and classical. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals.[15][16][17] Dion is the best-selling Canadian artist of all time,[18][19] is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era,[20][21] and is the only female artist to have two singles sell more than a million copies in the UK.[22] In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time.[23] In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time.[24][25] According to Sony Music Entertainment, Dion has sold over 200 million albums worldwide. \n\n\n\nMy Love: Ultimate Essential Collection 2008\n\n\nMy Love: Essential Collection is a greatest hits album by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. It was released by Columbia Records on October 24, 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). Before releasing My Love: Essential Collection, Dion had already sold over 200 million albums worldwide. In the album's liner notes, she dedicated this collection of songs, recorded between 1990 and 2008, to her fans who supported her throughout the years. My Love: Essential Collection was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. The two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include a new track, &quot;There Comes a Time&quot;. The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment Japan decided to issue another compilation, Complete Best in February 2008.\n\nMy Love: Essential Collection received a positive response. It topped the albums charts in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, as well as the compilation album chart in France. My Love: Essential Collection debuted at number two in Canada, number five in the United Kingdom and number eight in the United States, and was certified double-Platinum in Canada and Ireland, Platinum in Belgium and Gold in Mexico, Finland, New Zealand and Hungary. The first single from the album, &quot;My Love&quot;, is a semi-autobiographic song written for Dion by Linda Perry, originally available on Taking Chances (2007). In France and later in the United States, &quot;I'm Alive&quot; (Remix) was released as a promotional single.\n\nIn July 2011, the &quot;Ultimate Essential Collection&quot; was re-issued with both their respective track listings as part of Sony's The Essential line.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (Duet with Peabo Bryson)\n3.\t&quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot; (New Edit)\n5.\t&quot;My Love&quot; (Live Version)\n6.\t&quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Radio Edit)\n7.\t&quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; \n9.\t&quot;The Power of the Dream&quot; \n10.\t&quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; \n11.\t&quot;All by Myself&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Pour que tu m'aimes encore&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Tell Him&quot; (Duet with Barbra Streisand)\n\nDisc 2 \n\n1.\t&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; \n2.\t&quot;To Love You More&quot; (Radio Edit)\n3.\t&quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; \n4.\t&quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; (Duet with R.
