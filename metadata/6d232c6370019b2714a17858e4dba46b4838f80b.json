WHOLE LOTTA LOVE\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe last show of the tour and the last Led Zeppelin show ever! \r\nThis show alternates between brilliance and boredom, especially \r\nfrom Jimmy. But the good moments are very good. Since I've Been \r\nLoving You is a great version and there is a lot of experimentation \r\nwith a very long and great version of Trampled Underfoot and a long \r\nversion of Stairway To Heaven. Whole Lotta Love is a long jam that \r\nsounds great. Amazing bass from Jones as Jimmy spits out guitar \r\nflourishes and Robert and Bonzo cook behind this. One of the two \r\nshows from the 1980 Tour that didn't have Achilles Last Stand. But \r\nas the last ever show there is historical significance here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d232c6370019b2714a17858e4dba46b4838f80b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.07.07+Berlin%2C+Germany+%28Last+Show%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d232c6370019b2714a17858e4dba46b4838f80b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,35,44,99,112,1,155,39,20,161,120,88,228,219,164,107,72,56,248,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
