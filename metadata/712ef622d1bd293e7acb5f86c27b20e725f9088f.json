Originally just a few hundred tents, it now has 24,000 homes with a busy shopping street (known locally as the Champs-Elysees), hospitals and schools, and like every other city on earth, Zaatari has births, deaths, marriages and everything in between. In this episode, Anita tackles the logistical feat of providing water in the middle of a desert, Javid meets some of the children recovering from injuries of war and Ben does the bakery night shift to find out how 90,000 loaves are baked every day to feed the camp. Anita and Javid are invited to a wedding and Ben finds out how war has affected education.\r\n\r\n2)  Camp Infrastructure \r\nAnita investigates how Zaatari is building a new infrastructure that will bring it in line with any other modern metropolis. Anita also meets some of the 11 babies that are born in this refugee camp every single week. With over half of Zaatari's population under the age of 18, Ben will spend time with the remarkable Syrians who are determined to inspire their next generation. Whilst Javid follows the families making heartbreaking decisions about whether to leave Zaatari to start a new life abroad.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen0.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen1.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen2.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen3.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/0/00/The-Refugee-Camp-Our-Desert-Home-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1225 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 832 x 468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\nAudio: English\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nPart Size: 570 MB\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lpgqz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:712ef622d1bd293e7acb5f86c27b20e725f9088f","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Refugee.Camp.Our.Desert.Home.1of2.PDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"712ef622d1bd293e7acb5f86c27b20e725f9088f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,46,246,34,209,189,41,62,122,203,95,134,194,123,32,231,37,249,8,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
