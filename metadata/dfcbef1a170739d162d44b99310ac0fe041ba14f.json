In his obituary, the New York Times described him as &quot;one of the most admired writers in the Spanish-speaking world&quot; and an important influence on the Latin American boom, the explosion of Latin American literature in the 1960s-70s, while The Guardian called him &quot;Mexico's most celebrated novelist&quot;.\n\nHis many literary honors included the Miguel de Cervantes Prize as well as Mexico's highest award, the Belisario DomÃƒÂ­nguez Medal of Honor.
