He is considered one of the preeminent writers in the English language.\n\nMilton wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his epic poem PARADISE LOST (1667), written in blank verse.  His poetry and prose reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day.  Writing in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated AREOPAGITICA (1644) -- written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship -- is among history's most influential and impassioned defenses of free speech and freedom of the press.\n\n\nThis collection includes 5 editions of PARADISE LOST, including the Norton Critical Edition, and a generous selection of Milton's prose works on religion, politics, and domestic issues.
