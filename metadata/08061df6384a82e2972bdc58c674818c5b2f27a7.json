Other characters in the comic included a red kangaroo named Jack, a zorse (horse-zebra hybrid) called The Brumby, Bayshore the otter, the tiger Raj and a female black cat named Zeb, among others.\n\nThe comic was set on the fictional Bendigo Beach in Australia. The premise of the comic was Diego's day to day life as he and his friends try to woo the tourists as well as deal with Diego's ex from last summer.\n\nThe summary on the back of the graphic novel describes the story as:\n&quot;Diego the dingo spends the better part of his days in the company of his local friends, trolling the popular Bendigo Beach for tourists and one-night-stands. However, with the near limitless possibilities before him and the sudden reappearance of his ex-boyfriend, Diego finds himself struggling to make up his mind and sort through his conflicting feelings. Is he happy to remain a footloose beach bum with a voracious sexual appetite, or can he throw away his lifestyle and reputation for an old flame?&quot;\n\n\nThis is the full version. It's rated PG-13.
