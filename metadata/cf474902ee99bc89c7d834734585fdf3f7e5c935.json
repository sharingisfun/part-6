A large installer contains many features perceived as unnecessary by many experienced users:[1] Visual Basic ActiveX control, CD/DVD label creator, sound editor, photo editor, and others. The premium versions of Windows Vista also has all the home entertainment, DVD burning, movie editing and backup features. This has spawned a niche of unofficial, more streamlined installers, such as Nero Micro, which include only features deemed to be essential, resulting in installer sizes as low as 13 MB, and featuring &quot;just Nero Burning Rom with basic Audio/VideoCD support (English).&quot;[6] While many components can be removed using the official installer, its large size and the inability to remove all undesired components via its interface make these alternatives desirable. A valid Nero license key is still required for all installations.[1] One of the factors that produces even more criticism is the fact that the latest Nero 9 needs the huge .NET Framework 3.0 to run. As an example, the setup for Nero 6 Ultra Edition(which contains all the features) is ~33MB, while the setup for the 9 version is 370MB.\n\n            &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_(computer_software)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_(computer_software)&lt;/a&gt;\n=================================================================================\n\nAlso real fast, don't let it update - first and foremost the program doesn't need it anyway and second all it'll do is invalidate your key.\n\nAGAIN FOR THE IDIOTS ON TPB, THERE ARE NO VIRUS'S IN THE PROGRAM,  ZERO NONE!\n\n...no you know what I hate idiots and I definitely don't want any of them here.\n\nScrew it - THERE ARE TONZ OF VIRUS'S HERE ALL SORTS - EVEN SOME THAT'LL TURN YOU GAY OR REPUBLICAN! SOME OF THEM MAY EVEN EAT YOUR SOAL SO WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T DOWN LOAD THIS PROGRAM EVER - INFACT YOUR GETTING INFECTED RIGHT NOW JUST BY BEING ON THIS PAGE \n\n \nFor those of you who REALLY are paranoid run Md5checker which you can get here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.softpedia.com/dl/b79674fb18648859407c787df60fcc83/49404040/100061913/software/security/Md5Checker.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.softpedia.com/dl/b79674fb18648859407c787df60fcc83/49404040/100061913/software/security/Md5Checker.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndrag nero6.zip on to the program and it should give you an MD5 checksum of\n\nE55616BB89151C07CB47FBAEAE3EBC12\n\nand i do redownload and check all my torrents periodically.\n\n\n\nNERO 6 ULTRA EDITION LIGHT from FUWAD84 - \n&quot;SO SMALL ITS GOTTA BE A VIRUS....&quot;\n\n&quot;DOH!&quot;\n\n\nJust incase it asks(which it never ever does -BUT JUST INCASE)\n\n\nSERIAL: 1A23-4036-7088-1618-7864-8040\n\nWILL NOT WORK ON x64 WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH A USELESS OS FOR A PERSONAL COMPUTER\n\n\n========================SHOUT OUTS TO MY FAVORITE SHIT ON TPB====================\n\nSince I'm noticing more and more people seeding this torrent I thought why not enlighten visitors with the various other great, light and simple to install programs that I put on nearly every computer that I work on. Keep in mind I wouldn't be giving a shout out to it if I didn't use it myself.  \n\n------------------ESET Smart Security Business Edition by HeartbuG----------------\n\nBasically its the worlds greatest(and strangely enough lightest) combo firewall/antispam/antivirus suite and install's super f'in easy i've used it since july and it has yet to fail me. No need for key hunting and its as unintrusive as hell as best of all its uploaded by HeartbuG one of PirateBays best known crackers.\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4257661/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4257661/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-----------------------Microsoft Office 2003 Lite by FalconFour--------------------\n\nYou know whats one thing I REALLY hate about most of the Office suites that you get off of this site? There mostly bloat ware, your downloading 300MB+ of shit you don't use. Think about it.. when was the last time you opened up groove or access and if you do use those programs than your probably a rich bastard who can afford the software anyway. Most of us only use 3 programs mabe four at the most -&gt; Word, Excel, Powerpoint and mabe outlook(!?!) Well than this is the torrent for the majority of us who hate bloatware. Its one .exe about 70MB small and installs unattended in about 3 minutes. You get Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook AND NOTHING ELSE!!!\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3771346/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3771346/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso If you want to open, save and edit 2007 .docx files Office Lite will work with Microsoft's compatibility patch which you can get here. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&amp;displaylang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&amp;displaylang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------Macromedia Studio 8 With Working Keygen by Ronmarsden--------------\n\nOk for you web designers, flash cartoonists or photo editors out there - how many of you actually use Adobe bridge or both Photoshop AND Fireworks when there almost the same damn program!?! Im still on the theme of small is best and once again this is the case with Macromedia Studio 8, which comes with just Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks all the tools you ACTUALLY USE and no bloatware or shit that MUST update - works flawlessly\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4438534/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4438534/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n------------------------WinRAR 3.80 Professional by Frezeone----------------------\n\nI don't even need to give an intro to this wonderful filezipping program but will anyway. As far as compressing files go this is the jack of all traits can open and edit nearly any format known to man even opens .iso and other CD image files(but you can mount them with nero6) Best part as if it couldn't get any better - the installer is only 1 MB small!!! And it downloads in 25 seconds cuz theres like 1200 seeds of it, those numbers don't lie!\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4505441/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4505441/&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------Process Explorer by Mark Russinovich-----------------------\n\nNo its not on the Piratebay but its a program I use in place of task manager. Its actually a program that will present in a very detailed listing ALL of the programs, processes, keys, threads ect. running on your computer including ones that try to hide them selves( this shouldn't be a problem if you get Eset) You can see how much resource its robbing from your computer. Like I said I wouldn't post it if I didn't use it.\n\n            &lt;a href=&quot; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------CCleaner by Piriform----------------------------\n\n         (i didnt write any of this but I TOTALLY AGREE a MUST GET!!!)\n\nCCleaner is a freeware system optimization, privacy and cleaning tool.

Not just only is the OS but you even get options as to how you want to install the OS and the iso its self is also a standalone boot disk that has a linux based back up incase you need to get online but your HD crashed. I could go on all day how great this OS but I'm tired and have to get up soon. Its the OS that I am using as im typing this - Ive used it since August and have not had a single problem with it and its so nice surfing Microsofts website for driver updates seeing as how it will pass WGA.\n \n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4206516/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4206516/&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ATTENTION FIREFOX USERS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n&quot;CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE WON A NEW YADDA YADDA&quot; TIRED OF THAT?
