Newell, a rock singer and part-time kitchen porter who'd left his band the previous summer and Elliot, a drummer and former hippy traveler, had much in common. They shared a love of sunny 1960s pop music, punk rock and musical comedy. Neither Elliot nor Newell cared much for any kind of musical rule book. Both were dismayed by the new right-wing politics which had now taken over the country. Both were in their twenties, had time on their hands and were keen to start something new.\n\nThis is The Cleaners From Venus Vol. 1 Box Set, including the first three albums, completely remastered and previously only released on small-run cassettes, these three albums carved a niche for the cult band that would go on to become an inspiration to many. Martin Newell never played by the rules and went on to become a success in his own right.
