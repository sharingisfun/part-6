After more than 20 years fronting legendary sad sacks Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon, Kozelek, through his stripped-down, honest songwriting approach, has demonstrated an uncanny ability to cut straight through the bullshit and get at the core of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real.\nBut while KozelekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original material has earned him a reputation as one of the most unflinching songwriters of his generation, his ability to unlock the sentimental riches in other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work further cements his ability to find the heart of a song. Like Rats, a diverse collection of 13 covers from various artists spanning numerous genres, puts KozelekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack for musical reinvention to a vexing test, but in the end he passes with flying colors.\n\nWhether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tackling punk-reggae (Bad BrainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or just punk (The DescendentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silly GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), metal (DanzigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThirteenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or pop music mainstays (Sonny and CherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Got You BabeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Kozelek leaves little to no trace of the songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ origins, wiping the slate clean and filtering the music through his own staggeringly forlorn muse. Bruno MarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young GirlsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is stripped of its stomping drums, soaring vocals, and pop sass and left with KozelekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low mumble (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You young, wild girls, you make a mess of me / You young, wild girls will be the death of meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and sullen guitar, while The Misfits Ã¢â‚¬Å“Green HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is reduced to a hollow, moving shell of its manic, original version. Even the half-crazed cock rock of Ted Nugent (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Free-For-AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t invincible to KozelekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s human touch.\n\nWith weary vocals, trembling guitar, and a disposition to match, Kozelek makes sense of a slate of songs that otherwise share little if any common ground. Sometimes less is more, and Like Rats offers up considerable proof.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231688c5c07db3539327f373729293a0857489f2","amp;dn":"Mark+Kozelek+-+Like+Rats+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231688c5c07db3539327f373729293a0857489f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,22,136,197,192,125,179,83,147,39,243,115,114,146,147,160,133,116,137,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
