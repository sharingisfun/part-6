Disguised as a soldier, Mulan secretly takes her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in the Imperial army, training with a troop, led by the courageous Captain Shang. Never far away are MulanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guardian dragon, Mushu and lucky cricket, Cri-Kee. Will MulanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clever thinking help to defeat the ruthless leader, Shan-Yu.
