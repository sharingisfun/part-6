A compromised psychiatrist confronts the unstable patient he slept with... A father and a son wage a lethal battle of wits over the whereabouts of a stolen diamond and a missing woman... Along with completely original material, this new col-lection is a compilation of the best of Dennis Lehane's previously published short stories, including &quot;Until Gwen,&quot; which was adapted for the stage in 2005 and appears in this book as the play Coronado.\r\n\r\nAt turns suspenseful, surreal, romantic, and tragically comic, these tales journey headlong into the heart of our national mythsabout class, gender, freedom, and regeneration through violenceand reveal that the truth waiting for us there is not what we'd expect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d61ab8405c3736fa5532398f4908c056d1275c","amp;dn":"CORONADO+-+Dennis+Lehane+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d61ab8405c3736fa5532398f4908c056d1275c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,214,26,184,64,92,55,54,250,85,50,57,143,73,8,192,86,209,39,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
