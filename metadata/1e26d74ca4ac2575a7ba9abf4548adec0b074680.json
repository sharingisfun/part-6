Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime todayÃ¢â‚¬â€an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, where displays of affection are punished, informants are rewarded, and an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. Demick takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors, and through meticulous and sensitive reporting we see her subjects fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we witness their profound, life-altering disillusionment with the government and their realization that, rather than providing them with lives of abundance, their country has betrayed them.\n\n336 pages\nPublisher: Spiegel &amp; Grau; Reprint edition (September 21, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385523912\nISBN-13: 978-0385523912\nProduct Dimensions: 8 x 5.1 x 0.7 inches ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e26d74ca4ac2575a7ba9abf4548adec0b074680","amp;dn":"Nothing+to+Envy%3A+Ordinary+Lives+in+North+Korea+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e26d74ca4ac2575a7ba9abf4548adec0b074680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,38,215,76,164,172,37,117,167,186,154,191,69,72,173,236,11,7,70,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
