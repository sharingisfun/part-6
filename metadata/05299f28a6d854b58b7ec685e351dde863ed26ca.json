Dismissed by critics, seemingly dogged by bad luck, with drummer Rick Allen losing an arm in a car accident, HYSTERIA had to be an album to turn heads. In retrospect, it sounded like the first true hard rock record for the CD generation. Ambitious arrangements and remixes on songs such as &quot;Rocket&quot; and &quot;Armaggedon It,&quot; a crisp single in &quot;Animal,&quot; and a dense paean to love with &quot;Love Bites,&quot; all bets were off. Def Leppard had created an intriguing language of ideas that still speaks volumes more than a decade on.\n\nRecorded at Wisseloord Studios, Hilversum, Holland; Windmill Lane Studio 2, Dublin, Ireland; Studio Des Dames, Paris, France.\n\nDef Leppard: Joe Elliot (vocals); Rick Savage (bass guitar); Rick Allen (drums); Phil Collen, Steve Clark .\n\nPersonnel: Joe Elliott (vocals); Phil Collen, Steve Clark (guitar); Rick Allen (drums).\n\nAudio Mixers: Mike Shipley; Nigel Green.\n\nRecording information: Studio Des Dames, Paris, Fra; Windmill Lane Studio 2, Dublin, Ireland; Wisseloord Studio, Hilversum, The Netherlands.\n\nPhotographers: Ross Halfin; Laurie Lewis.\n\nUnknown Contributor Role: Steve Clark .\n\nDef Leppard: Joe Elliott (vocals); Steve Clark, Phil Collen (guitar); Rick Savage (bass); Rick Allen (drums).\n\nAdditional personnel: The Bankrupt Brothers (background vocals).\n\n\ntracks\n\nWomen\n\nRocket\n\nAnimal\n\nLove bites\n\nPour some sugar on me\n\nArmageddon it\n\nGods of war\n\nDon't shoot shotgun\n\nRun riot\n\nHysteria\n\nExcitable\n\nLove and affection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05299f28a6d854b58b7ec685e351dde863ed26ca","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard-Hysteria+Album+mp3-320k-winker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05299f28a6d854b58b7ec685e351dde863ed26ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,41,159,40,166,216,84,181,139,126,198,133,227,81,221,232,99,237,38,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
