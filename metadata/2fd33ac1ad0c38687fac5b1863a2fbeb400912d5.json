This battle would be particularly bloody and would result in the greatest loss of life in a single ever suffered by American soldiers. Bloody sites such as the Cornfield, Dunker Church and Bloody Lane would enter American history as some of the darkest points of our story. The battle would serve to highlight the inability of the Confederacy to mount an effective campaign on northern soil but it would also bring to light the continuing problem of Yankee leadership of its armies.\n\nAnother great book in the series, well-written and illustrated with period photos, maps, artwork and photos of artifacts. Sidebars include an artist's view of the battle, photos of Harper's Ferry, The Making of a Union Heroine and Gallery of the Dead.&quot;\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fd33ac1ad0c38687fac5b1863a2fbeb400912d5","amp;dn":"The+Bloodiest+day+-+The+Battle+of+Antietam+%28Time-Life+The+Civil+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fd33ac1ad0c38687fac5b1863a2fbeb400912d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,211,58,193,173,12,56,104,127,172,91,24,99,162,251,235,64,9,18,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
