Call this the latest and greatest bomb-string stoner pop/thunder rock/doom pop classic from Torche mastermind Steve Brooks and his fellow hook heroes. Call it the sweetest, catchiest, hugest riff colossus since &quot;Sky Valley&quot;. &quot;A pure sludge bulldozer&quot; - Spin. &quot;At long last, we know what life would be like in a parallel universe where The Melvins became a pop sensation instead of Nirvana&quot; - Revolver. Look for them at SXSW and on a full European tour. They&amp;#039;ve shared stages with Isis, Jesu, Baroness, and Mogwai, among others.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f063458604bd93032e7ac592eeaba5937e22f8","amp;dn":"Torche+-+Meanderthal+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f063458604bd93032e7ac592eeaba5937e22f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,240,99,69,134,4,189,147,3,46,122,197,146,238,171,165,147,126,34,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
