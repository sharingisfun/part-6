Now brought up to date, this revised and improved\n\nsecond edition is ideal for classical mechanics courses for first- and\n\nsecond-year undergraduates with foundation skills in mathematics. The book\n\nretains all the features of the first edition, including numerous worked\n\nexamples, challenging problems and extensive illustrations, and has been\n\nrestructured to improve the flow of ideas. It now features new examples taken\n\nfrom recent developments, such as laser slowing of atoms, exoplanets and black\n\nholes; a 'Hints, Clues and Answers' section for the end-of-chapter problems to\n\nsupport student learning; and a solutions manual for instructors at www.cambridge.org/kandk\n\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nDaniel Kleppner is Lester Wolfe Professor of Physics Emeritus at Massachusetts\n\nInstitute of Technology. For his contributions to teaching he has been awarded\n\nthe Oersted Medal by the American Association of Physics Teachers and the\n\nLilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society. He has also received the Wolf\n\nPrize in Physics and the National Medal of Science.\n\n\nRobert Kolenkow was Associate Professor of Physics at Massachusetts Institute of\n\nTechnology. Renowned for his skills as a teacher, Kolenkow was awarded the\n\nEverett Moore Baker Award for Outstanding Teaching","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e09be5260f329fc0217eea799f8baccaf2494a","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Mechanics+%282e%29+-+Kleppner+%2B+Kolenkow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e09be5260f329fc0217eea799f8baccaf2494a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,224,155,229,38,15,50,159,192,33,126,234,121,159,139,172,202,242,73,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
