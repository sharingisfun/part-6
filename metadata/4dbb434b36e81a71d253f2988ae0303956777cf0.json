Instant non-destructive and reversible transformation from CD \nproject to DVD-A project is simple. Also supported are DVD real-time text and \nstatic text, still images, slideshows, and graphic menus, ISRC and UPC/EAN codes. \nWith WaveLab 6 you can automatically create menus, drop in hidden &quot;bonus&quot; tracks, \nimport and burn DVD video content ... the WaveLab 6 feature set goes on!\n\nWaveLab 6 includes a complete Red Book CD mastering toolset, including signal \nprocessing, accurate PQ editing, CD text, track-sheet and CD cover layout tools \nand error detection and correction. Extended CD burning, including audio, ISO data,\nand mixed-mode formats is part of WaveLab 6's tool set. Individual clips in the \nAudio Montage can be defined as CD tracks and burned directly to CD. A label editor\nlets you create custom labels and CD covers. And for backup, WaveLab 6 allows \nstorage of projects and data on CDs or other media.\n\n\n\nImprovements Steinberg WaveLab 6.1.0.340:\n\n- Podcast creator. This is a rather large feature, please refer to the addendum \n  documentation.\n- Better optimizations for Intel Core 2 Duo processors.\n- Batch processor: new ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Audio Injector ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ plugin. This plugin allows to insert \n  an audio file before or/and after the files to process, with an optional \n  cross-fade process. The file(s) to inject must have the same number of channels \n  and sample rates as the source files, and must not be longer that 60 seconds.\n- Batch processor: new ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Trimmer ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ plugin. This plugin allows to cut a specific \n  time at the head or/and tail of the audio file. It can be useful when combined \n  with the Silence plugins, Fade-in/out plugins, and reverb-like plugins.\n- Waves VST plugins are now supported from the Master Section (must be using the \n  latest VST shell).\n- Audio Montage: it is now possible to navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history \n  using the more standard key shortcuts Alt+Left/Right arrow keys. Some extended \n  keyboards have dedicated keys for this. Same thing for mouse Back/Forward buttons \n  (mouses with 2 additional buttons on the side). In other words, it is possible to \n  navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history using the same shortcuts as eg. in \n  Microsoft internet explorer.\n- Audio Montage: better display when using Control + left/right arrow (allow to \n  navigate from clip boundary to clip boundary).\n- Audio Montage / Wave : Key shortcut added for &lt;&lt; Move edit cursor to position.. &gt;&gt;\n  : &lt; ! &gt;\n- Key shortcut added for &lt;&lt; Live input.. &gt;&gt; : &lt; Control + Shift + I &gt;\n\n\n\nBug fixes Steinberg WaveLab Studio 6.1.0.340:\n\n- Crytal Resampler: bug fix and slightly improved quality in &lt;&lt; Ultra &gt;&gt; mode.\n- Burning an Audio Montage using Track effects, and with the option &lt;&lt; Render to \n  temporary file before burning &gt;&gt;, had for effect to apply the track effects twice.\n- CD-Text issue fixed.\n- When moving a Xfade left and right the volume enveloppe points don't move anymore.\n- Improved look and installation under Vista.\n- Problem fixed with some plugins used with a mono file.\n- Audio CD grabbing: the last audio track of a CD-Extra could not be grabbed and \n  its length was wrongly displayed.\n- Opening the Live Input window while a meter window was open, caused a crash.\n- Recording audio to a mono track of an Audio Montage, was systematically adding \n  a new track to the montage.\n- Fixed possible problem when exporting text in Excel format (eg. Clip list).\n- Audio Montage: playback can now start even if some audio peak files are being \n  built.\n- Improved compatibility when saving &lt;&lt; ulaw &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; alaw &gt;&gt; audio files with a \n  WAV file header.\n- In the montage &quot;Files&quot; tab, the file date's day and month were exchanged.\n- It was not possible to erase a Montage track name.\n- Batch renaming of clips and markers: the initial value of the &lt;&lt; counter &gt;&gt;\n  procedure was ignored.\n- Useless peak files with a null size could sometimes be created for some audio \n  files.\n- Auto Split: useless audio files with a null size could be created, in certain \n  cases.\n- Master Section slot key commands above 3 where not selectable.\n- Auto Split: in mode &lt;&lt; Cut Head and Tail &gt;&gt;, the option &lt;&lt; Insert silence at \n  start or end &gt;&gt; was ignored.\n- Silence plugin: (batch processor). The plugin works nice correctly.\n- Loudness distribution: the dB value displayed at the mouse cursor position, \n  did not take into account the AES17 preference.\n- Opening a copy of an Audio Montage, would change the date of the original montage.\n- Audio file path is now remembered when opening an audio file as a montage.\n- Audio Montage: saving a clip will now always set the right file extension. \n- Audio Montage: the colour condition feature was not working.\n- Other minor problems.\n\n\n\nSteinberg WaveLab 6 System Requirements:\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nThe minimum system requirements state the minimal specification your computer \nmust have to be able to use the software.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at October, 31 2009 - 16.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbb434b36e81a71d253f2988ae0303956777cf0","amp;dn":"Steinberg+WaveLab+6.1.0.340+%28Cracked+by+TEAM+AiR%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbb434b36e81a71d253f2988ae0303956777cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,187,67,75,54,232,26,113,210,83,242,152,138,224,48,57,86,119,124,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
