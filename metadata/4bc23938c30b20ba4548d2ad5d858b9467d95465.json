By the time Ford surfaces, everything has changed. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental extremists have taken control of the island -- or are they thugs hired by the Russian's competitors? Whatever the motive, they have herded everyone together and threatened to kill one hostage every hour until midnight unless their demands are met, at which point they will just blow everybody up. \r\n\r\nElectronic jammers make communications with the outside world impossible. The only hope of avoiding terrible consequences is Doc Ford. The militants don't know Ford's capabilities, or that he is still on the loose. But that situation won't last for long -- and the clock is ticking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc23938c30b20ba4548d2ad5d858b9467d95465","amp;dn":"CHASING+MIDNIGHT+-+Randy+Wayne+White.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc23938c30b20ba4548d2ad5d858b9467d95465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,194,57,56,195,11,32,186,69,72,210,173,93,133,139,148,103,217,84,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
