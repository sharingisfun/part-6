If a text string is longer than the path, the characters no longer fall off the path. \n-CorelDRAW no longer stops responding when trying to bring up the Edit Text dialog box for text frames that contain empty lines or when opening files that contain cloned text. \n\nOpening and saving files\n-Arrowheads in CorelDRAW (CDR) files saved to version 12 are preserved. \n-CorelDRAW no longer stops responding when opening certain files from older versions. \n-Hyperlinks are preserved in saved files. \n\nPrinting\n-CorelDRAW no longer stops responding when printing files that contain imported EPS files. \n-Disabled colors do not appear in the final output when you print color separations. \n\nTools\n-CorelDRAW no longer stops responding when double clicking a control arm of a pattern fill with the Interactive Fill tool. \n-When working with a custom workspace, you can use the Alt key with the Polyline tool to draw circular arcs. \n-Selecting and deleting nodes with the Shape tool in certain files no longer causes the application to stop responding. \n\nCorel PHOTO-PAINT\n-Mask feathering works as expected. \n-You can choose different anti-aliasing settings for text from the property bar. \n\nCorel Connect\n-Undocking the Connect docker no longer results in duplicated tray content. \n\nSystem Requirements\n-MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 8 (32-bit or 64-bit Editions), MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 (32-bit or 64-bit Editions), Windows VistaÃ‚Â® (32-bit or 64-bit Editions), or WindowsÃ‚Â® XP (32-bit), all with latest service packs installed \n-IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® 4, AMD AthlonÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 64 or AMD OpteronÃ¢â€žÂ¢ \n-1GB RAM \n-1.5GB hard disk space (for typical installation without content - additional disk space is required during installation) \n-Mouse or tablet \n-1024 x 768 screen resolution \n-DVD drive \n-MicrosoftÃ‚Â® Internet ExplorerÃ‚Â® 7 or higher\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4260069&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4260069&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbaf2965b7dc27b6f8c0c546f3a6f98006f95d01","amp;dn":"CorelDRAW+Graphics+Suite+X6+16.4.0.1280+SP4+%2864+bit%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbaf2965b7dc27b6f8c0c546f3a6f98006f95d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,175,41,101,183,220,39,182,248,192,197,70,243,166,249,128,6,249,93,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
