But they're not the only ones who're after the gold; soon they meet a group of &quot;honorable&quot; citizens and the cavalry crosses their way too - and that is even before they enter Indian territory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e034b4e7f67df76fce21c2397af2f617dcd1d7e0","amp;dn":"Mackennas+Gold++%28Western+1969%29++Gregory+Peck%2C+Omar+Sharif+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e034b4e7f67df76fce21c2397af2f617dcd1d7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,52,180,231,246,125,247,111,206,33,194,57,122,242,246,23,220,209,215,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
