To revert it to SP2 and get uncensored, follow the instructions in the readme file in the program folder, which are this:\n\nTo disable the XP updates, remove base_xp.tah and omake_xp.tah from the arcs folder, delete or rename ObsDX9.exe, and rename ObsDX9old.exe to ObsDX9.exe\n\nThis will revert the game to SP2 uncensored.\n\nAlso note that the configuration utility does not completely work with either of these. When you change your settings you must hit Start for them to be applied. However, the utility will crash and not launch the game. You must use the normal shortcut.\n\nSorry, I can't fix this, as I didn't code the utility. Just be sure to hit Start to apply your changes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad144434de2e5da56fe1893877848d7466e455e","amp;dn":"TechArts+3D+Custom+Girl+Creator+w%2F+SP2+and+XP+updates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad144434de2e5da56fe1893877848d7466e455e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,209,68,67,77,226,229,218,86,254,24,147,135,120,72,215,70,110,69,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
