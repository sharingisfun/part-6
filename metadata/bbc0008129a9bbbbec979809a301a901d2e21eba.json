You could probably toss in a few issues of Power Girl if you wanted, but they don't play much of a role, and they don't have the banner, so I didn't.  There are 120 books in this compilation, so it's over 2Gb.  Anyway, I couldn't find a torrent that had anywhere near a complete Brightest Day list, so I made my own.\n\nEnjoy and Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbc0008129a9bbbbec979809a301a901d2e21eba","amp;dn":"Brightest+Day+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbc0008129a9bbbbec979809a301a901d2e21eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,192,0,129,41,169,187,187,236,151,152,9,163,1,169,1,210,226,30,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
