Boyash Gypsy music, which until now was only performed within this small (30k) minority of Hungarians. Originally from Transylvania, the Boyash Gypsies mainly live in 4 districts of the southwest. Their melodies are more Romanian than usual Gypsy/Hungarian music, with a sense of group fun about it. When one vocal is singing solo, do the rest of the players shut up? No, they keep on with constant, consistent asides that fill up the odd gaps or pauses, if anyone dares to let a second go without a shout, a dabadado, or a group sing-along. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the aboriginal delights of the album.\nKanizsa Csillagai (literally translated as Stars of Kanizsa). Formed in 1993 by 5 young Boyash and Wallachian Gypsies from Nagykanizsa, the leader of the group is singer/guitarist/dancer ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n HorvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡th. This is their 2. cd, and is indicative of a family recording (ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife and brothers are on here too) as ever IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard. If only all groups were this collaborative and confident with weaving themselves together.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nKhanci Dos: Bi Granica (No Limits)\n&quot;The band was formed in 1987 at Nagyecsed (North Eastern Hungary), and at first they interpreted the songs of the local Romania community. Most of the members moved to Budapest in 1991, the present formation of the band working together since 1998.\nThey represent the culture of the three main Romani groups living in Hungary, the so called Romungro, Vlach Rom and Boyash. Beside the friendships their aim is to give an authentic representation of the music (whether Gypsy or not), to reduce the prejudices among the different groups of Gypsies and to interpret this variegated culture on a high professional level. Completing their repertoire, beside the songs of Nagyecsed, they play self-composed pieces and Gypsy songs from around the world.\nThe band plays traditional contemporary gypsy music using a very witty, interesting and unusual orchestration. The songs very collected from Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Balkan area. Colorful and enjoyable compilation. Traditional sounds are mixed with modern instruments (electric guitar and drums), but the water-jug is the most characteristic elements of this music.&quot;\n\n\nKalyi Jag: CigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nyszerelem (Gipsy Love)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œListening to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGipsy LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (i.e., ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nyszerelemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) by Kalyi Jag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ one begins to understand how the Roma managed to survive for centuries without a country of their own: through passionate expression of their music. Transcending time and politics, music expressed the Roma way of life like nothing else could, since they traveled from place to place. Kalyi Jag brings to life the full Gipsy spirit: they sing of cruel fate, lost love, poverty, infidelity and jealousy. They sing about a simple way of life: selling horses at the fair and the thoughts and feelings of being a knife-grinder, who wanders from village to village plying his trade. They sing about a son who abandons the straight and narrow life, breaking his motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart, and about the son who brings pleasure to his young wife by playing music on his guitar. The rhythms are universally Gipsy and Balkan-like, they do not resemble any of the Hungarian popular music know as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnotaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which is often played by Gipsy bands in restaurants in Hungary. Although Kalyi Jag uses a few modern instruments, like the guitar, they provide traditional percussion using hollow milk cans and other common utensils, such as spoons or vocalization. The harmonies are typical Roma .. they are hauntingly familiar to anyone who enjoys Balkan music, because so many ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½traditionalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Balkan sounds incorporate them into their village music. This is understandable as the Gypsies have wandered into and out of all the countries in Eastern Europe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ some settled down into ghettos in the cities or segregated sections of villages, maintaining their unique identity and way of life for centuries.\nMost gypsies today, can be categorized by where they live: either city-dwellers (urban gypsies) or rural dwellers (village gypsies). The time of wandering in caravans, over mountains and settling in the valley for an overnight stay, has for the most part been abandoned. For the past 100 years or so, the better known Gipsy bands have originated in the cities where their talents were utilized in restaurants and hotels, playing music for the clientele. The music which they played was usually the popular music of the day or national music of the country, with violin as the primary instrument In Hungary, the cimbalom (a type of hammered dulcimer, played with a mallet) has been almost universally identified with Gipsy music. Although segregation has occurred, most often due to discrimination and often has a negative connotation, it helped foster and maintain the Gipsy way of life. On many levels, the gypsies were viewed as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“outsidersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ yet this fostered their identify, cohesion, and community spirit in a way nothing else could. In the past, music was the only way to maintain the freedom of the Gipsy spirit and express universal sorrow and melancholy in the midst of harsh circumstances. Today, the younger Gipsy musicians, although remaining true to their roots, are often college-educated. Kalman Balogh, the world-renown young Gipsy cimbalom player and some members of Kalyi Jag, Jozsef Balogh and his wife, Agnes Balogh-Kunstler, have studied music formally. They remain true to the rural Gipsy music. The rural gypsies were known for creating primarily sorrowful and melancholic songs. They also used vocalization, such as, repetitive made-up sounds or created rhythms, by slapping ones hand on the thighs, or stomping on the floor. Emotional extremes are the core basis of the origin of these sounds and the music itself. Gypsies can express, like nobody else on earth (except perhaps for African-Americans, i.e., Blacks, who sing the blues) the pure love of life despite pain and sorrow. Kalyi Jag expresses the eternal yin and yang cycles of life, love and hate, happiness and sadness, hope and frustration as no other Gipsy group has done before. In addition, they compose and create songs and music reflective of their roots. The compositions are original and new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but the traditional sound they create is as old as the Gipsy culture itself. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGipsy SzerelemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ will live up to your highest expectations of what good music should sound like. It is a treasure-chest of music whose roots go very deep ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the expression of the eternal opposites of life provides a universal appeal for people who have eclectic tastes in music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n - Erika Borsos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:915f7b470c6ab7008902faf2f0d65f8fe5d3625d","amp;dn":"Gypsy+Music+from+Hungary+%284+bands%2C+full+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"915f7b470c6ab7008902faf2f0d65f8fe5d3625d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,95,123,71,12,106,183,0,137,2,250,242,240,214,95,143,229,211,98,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
