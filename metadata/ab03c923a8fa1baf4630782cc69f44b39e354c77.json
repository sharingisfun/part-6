Fronted by Buster Bloodvessel (born Douglas Trendle), the band was formed in 1976 while the members were together at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School near Manor House, North London. They were at their most popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s, during a period when other ska revival bands, such as Madness and The Specials, filled the charts. Bad Manners spent 111 weeks in the British singles charts between 1980 and 1983.[1]\n\nAfter becoming popular in London, Bad Manners signed to Magnet Records in 1980 for a six figure sum, and then became more well known. Some of Bad Manners&amp;#039; more notable hits include &quot;My Girl Lollipop&quot;, &quot;Lip Up Fatty&quot;, &quot;Ne Ne Na Na Na Na Nu Nu&quot;, &quot;Lorraine&quot;, &quot;Just A Feeling&quot;, &quot;Walking In The Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Can Can&quot; and &quot;Special Brew&quot;. One of the main reasons for their notoriety was their outlandish huge-tongued and shaven-headed frontman, Buster Bloodvessel. His manic exploits got them banned from the British BBC TV chart show Top of the Pops.\n\n\nMembers:\nBuster Bloodvessel (Douglas Trendle)\nLouis Cook (guitar)\nDavid Farren (bass)\nMartin Stewart (keyboards)\nBrian Tuitti (drums)\nGus Herman (trumpet)\nChris Kane (saxophone)\nAndrew Marson (saxophone) \n\n\nTorrent includes\n\nSka &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; B (Magnet) 1980 \nEat The Beat 1988\nReturn of the Ugly (Blue Beat) 1989 \nFat Sound (Pork Pie) 1992 \nSkinhead 1992\nInner London Violence 1994\nGreatest Hits Live 1997\nViva La Ska Revolution (1998)\nHeavy Petting (Moon) 1997 \nSka Party 2001\nStupidity (Bad Records) 2003 \n\nIt is not my torrent. \nIt is inaccurated but worth to download.\nCheck out files before you start to burn mp3&amp;#039;s on your CD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab03c923a8fa1baf4630782cc69f44b39e354c77","amp;dn":"Bad+Manners+-+Collection+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab03c923a8fa1baf4630782cc69f44b39e354c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,3,201,35,168,250,27,175,70,48,120,44,198,159,68,179,158,53,76,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
