Each year, it has gotten bigger and bigger in production as electronic music has boomed in North America and around the world. The nice thing about Movement Festival is that the curators arenâ€™t bringing that crap EDM to this festival and keep to its roots, Detroit Techno, quality underground acts, and producers/DJs that would not often get booked during the year without this festival. Each year I have gone, Iâ€™ve always wanted to see Kraftwerk on the bill. It would only be fitting they headline the festival. Without them, we would not be able to enjoy this kind of music today had it not been for them. I was absolutely over the moon when I found out they would be headlining the first night of the festival!\r\n\r\nOf course I would be taping! I brought in both rigs, my AT831s and my 717 + D8 comboâ€¦ I love the sound of the DAT and 717 when recording from the stack. I wish I could say that these tapes were flawless with quality. But there seems to be some hissing on the D8 recording and I am not sure why? Then this recording has one or two .5 second static places at the end of the set. This may be due to cables or how absolutely hot it was this weekend and this stuff sitting in my backpack all day in 90 degree heat. I donâ€™t get out taping much anymore, so I am not worried about getting a perfect tape. Theyâ€™re for my enjoyment, but hey, if you want to download it, go ahead! Itâ€™s not bad in any regard. Just not a flawless tape like I always hope.\r\n\r\nThe set though, was amazing! As usual! I have not listened to any new Kraftwerk recordings since I saw them back in October 2016 at the Masonic, but it seems there are some different variations in the performances of these songs. Very subtle differences, but for people who listen to Kraftwerk pretty much religiously, you can tell! They were supposed to go on at 10:40 but they started 10 minutes early and I hadnâ€™t started rolling tape yet! So, I missed the intro and spliced the beginning from another recording of mine. Literally 3 seconds or so. A few talkers around me, and some just downright rude people. Most of them younger people who have no sense of manners or respect of others and will just plow right through you as they go by and say, â€œThis is boring, lets go to another stage.â€ Mind you, these are the same youngsters that are making sure they get all their snapchats and selfies right to show all their friendsâ€¦ \r\n\r\nThe people who were musically in tune with what they were witnessing had their jaws to the floor. The 3D show is always amazing, and the sound was crisp and punchy. Ralf with many words at the end, â€˜Good night!â€™ Sample below to judge. Overall, the weekend was great and saw so many acts that I generally donâ€™t get to see without traveling to other cities. Ame, Tale of Us, Maceo Plex, DJ Tennis, Digweed were all highlights. If you like electronic music, I highly suggest hitting this festival up once. Until next timeâ€¦ Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7f34e06783901377cee5c4bdfda4c144bfc73d","amp;dn":"Kraftwerk+2016-05-28+Movement+Festival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7f34e06783901377cee5c4bdfda4c144bfc73d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,127,52,224,103,131,144,19,119,206,229,196,189,253,164,193,68,191,199,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
