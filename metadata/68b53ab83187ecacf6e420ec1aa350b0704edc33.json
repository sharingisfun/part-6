But Harry is the only person who knows about Thibor Ferenczy, a vampire long buried in the mountains of Romania--still horribly alive, in undeath--and Thibor's insane &quot;offspring,&quot; Boris Dragosani, who rips information from the souls of the dead in a terrible, ever-lasting form of torture.\r\n\r\nSomehow, Harry must convince Britain's E-Branch that only by working together can they locate and destroy Dragosani and his army of demonic warriors--before the half-vampire succeeds in taking over the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by James Langdon\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b53ab83187ecacf6e420ec1aa350b0704edc33","amp;dn":"Brian+Lumley+-+Necroscope+%28Necroscope+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b53ab83187ecacf6e420ec1aa350b0704edc33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,181,58,184,49,135,236,172,246,228,32,236,26,163,80,176,112,78,220,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
