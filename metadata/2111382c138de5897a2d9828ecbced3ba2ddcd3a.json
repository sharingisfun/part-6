Alternatively, SPSS Amos offers a non-graphical method to specify models. SPSS Amos is the perfect tool for a variety of purposes, including:\n# Psychology - Develop models to understand how drug, clinical, and art therapies affect mood\n# Medical and healthcare research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Confirm which of three variables ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“confidence, savings, or research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ best predicts a doctorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s support for prescribing generic drugs\n# Social sciences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Study how socioeconomic status, organizational membership, and other determinants influence differences in voting behavior and political engagement\n# Educational research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Evaluate training program outcomes to determine impact on classroom effectiveness\n# Market research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Model how customer behavior impacts new product sales or analyze customer satisfaction and brand loyalty\n# Institutional research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Study how work-related issues affect job satisfaction\n# Business planning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Create econometric and financial models and analyze factors affecting workplace job attainment\n# Program evaluation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Evaluate program outcomes or behavioral models using SEM to replace traditional stepwise regression\n\nFeatures and benefits\n* IBM SPSS Amos makes structural equation modeling (SEM) easy and accessible\nIBM SPSS Amos builds models that more realistically reflect complex relationships because any numeric variable, whether observed (such as non-experimental data from a survey) or latent (such as satisfaction and loyalty) can be used to predict any other numeric variable.\nIts rich, visual framework lets you to easily compare, confirm and refine models.\nQuickly build graphical models using SPSS AmosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ simple drag-and-drop drawing tools. Models that used to take days to create are just minutes away from completion. And once the model is finished, simply click your mouse and assess your modelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fit. Then make any modifications and print a presentation-quality graphic of your final model.\nA non-graphical, programmatic approach, introduced with SPSS Amos 20, improves accessibility for those who can benefit by specifying models directly. Its scripting capabilities improve the productivity of users who need to run large, complicated models, and make it easy to generate many similar models that differ slightly.\nIts approach to multivariate analysis encompasses and extends standard methods ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including regression, factor analysis, correlation and analysis of variance.\n\n* Obtain Bayesian estimates of model parameters and other quantities\nBayesian analysis enables you to apply your subject-area expertise or business insight to improve estimates by specifying an informative prior distribution. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the underlying computational method for Bayesian estimation. The MCMC algorithm is fast and the MCMC tuning parameter can be adjusted automatically.\nPerform estimation with ordered categorical and censored data Create a model based on non-numerical data without having to assign numerical scores to the data. Or work with censored data without having to make assumptions other than the assumption of normality. You can also impute numerical values for ordered-categorical and censored data. The resulting dataset can be used as input to programs that require complete numerical data.\n\n* Impute missing values or latent variable scores\nChoose from three data imputation methods: regression, stochastic regression, or Bayesian. Use regression imputation to create a single completed dataset. Use stochastic regression imputation or Bayesian imputation to create multiple imputed datasets. You can also impute missing values or latent variable scores.\nnput data from a variety of file formats (IBMÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® SPSSÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Statistics, MicosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Excel, text files, or many others). Select grouping variables and group values. IBM SPSS Amos also accepts data in a matrix format if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve computed a correlation or covariance matrix.\n\nSee how easy it is to use IBM SPSS Amos in this page &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/statistics/amos/features.html?S_CMP=wspace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/statistics/amos/features.html?S_CMP=wspace&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem requirements\nOperating systems\nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or Windows XP \nSoftware\n- Internet Explorer 6\n- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 or higher\nHardware\n- Memory: 256 MB RAM minimum\n- Minimum free drive space: 125 MB\n\nInstall Notes\nPlease &quot;follow readme.txt in \\EQX.&quot;\n\nHave a nice day \n\n\nIf you want to download direct last uploads visit: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2111382c138de5897a2d9828ecbced3ba2ddcd3a","amp;dn":"IBM+SPSS+Amos+v20.0.0+Build+817+%5BThumperDC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2111382c138de5897a2d9828ecbced3ba2ddcd3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,17,56,44,19,141,229,137,122,45,152,40,236,188,237,59,162,221,205,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
