Produced by Jack Richardson, C.M., they were the first Canadian rock group to have a No.1 hit in the United States (see 1970 in music).\n\nThe Guess Who started out as a local Winnipeg band formed by singer/guitarist Chad Allan in 1960 and initially called Al and the Silvertones. This was changed to Chad Allan &amp; the Reflections in 1962, by which point the band consisted of Chad Allan (vocals/guitar), Bob Ashley (keyboards), Randy Bachman (guitars), Jim Kale (bass), and Garry Peterson (drums). All the band members were born in Winnipeg.\n\nThe band's debut single (&quot;Tribute To Buddy Holly&quot;) was released on Canadian-American Records in 1962. Chad Allan and the Reflections then signed with Quality Records and released several flop singles in 1963/64, including one mis-credited to Bob Ashley &amp; The Reflections. By 1965, the group was forced to change its name to Chad Allan &amp; the Expressions after a U.S. group called The Reflections had scored a hit with &quot;Just Like Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;.\n\nIt was at this point that the band scored their first hit, a 1965 rendition of Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates' &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot;. This track reached #1 in Canada, #22 in the U.S (where Quality had licensed the track to the American Scepter label for release in the U.S.) , and #27 in Australia. However, in an attempt to build a mystique around the record, Quality Records credited the single only to &quot;Guess Who?&quot; It was hoped that some listeners might assume the &quot;Guess Who?&quot; identity was deliberately masking several famous performers working under a pseudonym -- given the &quot;beat group&quot; nature of the record, perhaps even members of The Beatles and/or other popular British Invasion bands. In concealing the identity of the band in this fashion, Quality Records may have been influenced by a similar ploy made the previous year by &quot;The You Know Who Group&quot;, an American outift whose Merseybeat-ish 1964 single &quot;Roses Are Red My Love&quot; had peaked at #43 in the US, and at #21 in Canada.\n\nIt is debatable as to whether anyone was really fooled by the &quot;Guess Who?&quot; ruse, or if the record would have been a hit regardless of the artist credit. But the upshot was that, even after Quality Records revealed the band was &quot;really&quot; Chad Allan &amp; The Expressions, disc jockeys still announced the group as Guess Who?, effectively forcing the band to rename themselves. So although singles were issued as being by &quot;Guess Who?&quot;, on their first two albums, the band was credited as both &quot;Guess Who?&quot; and &quot;Chad Allan &amp; The Expressions&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greatest of the Guess Who 1988\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nThese Eyes\nLaughing\nUndun\nNo Time\nAmerican Woman\nHand Me Down World\nAlbert Flasher\nGlamour Boy\nStar Baby\nClap for the Wolfman\nDancinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Fool\nWhen the Band was SinginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShakin All OverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a23870f552d19b5564b2dd1993de6857d3cc7f4","amp;dn":"The+Guess+Who+-+Greatest+Hits+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a23870f552d19b5564b2dd1993de6857d3cc7f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,35,135,15,85,45,25,181,86,75,45,209,153,61,230,133,125,60,199,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
