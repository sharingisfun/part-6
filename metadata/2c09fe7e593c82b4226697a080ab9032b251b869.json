However, Peter&amp;#039;s trying to move on, and he&amp;#039;s smitten with a brainy, bombshell barrister he&amp;#039;s been chatting with online. However, when she comes to his house for their first face-to-face, she isn&amp;#039;t refined, isn&amp;#039;t Ivy League, and isn&amp;#039;t even a lawyer. Instead, it&amp;#039;s Charlene, a prison escapee who&amp;#039;s proclaiming her innocence and wants Peter to help her clear her name. But Peter wants nothing to do with her, prompting the loud and shocking Charlene to turn Peter&amp;#039;s perfectly ordered life upside down, jeopardizing his effort to get back with his wife and woo a billion dollar client.\n\nSteve Martin ...
