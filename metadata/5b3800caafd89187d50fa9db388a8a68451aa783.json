The multichannel layer has much better dynamics, so with downmixing them we got a better sounding album.\r\n\r\nSo, whats the dynamic range of this!?\r\n\r\nPretty good, actually. Dynamic Range Meter gives it a score of DR11 (original CD is a horrible DR6). Full log on 'Technical/foo_dr.txt'\r\n\r\nWhy 48KHz and not 96KHz?\r\n\r\nThe SACD only have 22KHz of usable information (seems that this was digitally recorded and mastered), so everything above this frecuency is DSD noise a.k.a useless white noise. Proof of this in 'Technical/Morning Glory SACD cutoff.jpg', look at the lowpass at 23KHz, and the noise from 30Khz.\r\n\r\nWhy the insane clipping in &quot;Morning Glory&quot;?\r\n\r\nThe guitars' tracks are clipped *before mixing*, so theres nothing to do.\r\n\r\nProcessing chain?\r\n\r\nMorning Glory SACD -&gt; foobar2000 + foo_input_sacd (multistage DP/multichannel)    -&gt; iZotope RX 4 (24 to 32bit float, filtering, resample) -&gt; iZotope Ozone 7 (declipping) -&gt; Adobe Audition CC with custom downmix matrix -&gt; iZotope Ozone 7 (EQ and dithering) -&gt; foobar2000 + libFLAC 1.3.1 level 8    -&gt; MusicBrainz Picard -&gt; Mp3tag -&gt; foobar2000 + Lyric Show Panel\r\n\r\nSeed, share and enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3800caafd89187d50fa9db388a8a68451aa783","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory+%281995%29+24bit%2F48KHz+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3800caafd89187d50fa9db388a8a68451aa783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,56,0,202,175,216,145,135,213,15,169,219,56,138,138,104,69,26,167,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
