He became a\r\nglobal sensation with the release of the Oscar-winning, semi-autobiographical\r\nmovie Purple Rain in 1984, embarking on an incredible journey of musical\r\nself-discovery that continued right up to his passing in April 2016, aged 57.\r\n\r\nFrom the psychedelic Around the World in a Day to his masterpiece album\r\nSign O' the Times and experiments with hip-hop and jazz, Prince was one of\r\nmost ambitious and prolific songwriters of his generation. He tested the\r\nboundaries of taste and decency with explicit sexual lyrics and stage shows\r\nduring his early career and in the 1990s fought for ownership of his name and\r\ncontrol of his music, played out in a public battle with his former label, Warner.\r\nHighly regarded as one of the most flamboyant live performers ever, Prince was\r\na controversial and famously elusive creative force.\r\n\r\nContributors include Revolution guitarist Dez Dickerson, Paisley Park label\r\npresident Alan Leeds, hip-hop legend Chuck D and Prince 'Mastermind' and UK\r\nsoul star Beverley Knight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/78095774743315988157.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/32348051610989185177.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/85130099022402509901.png\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 747 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1500 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 13s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a1ca7b18606c9cce3593a0321609f06d2fe1582","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Prince+A+Purple+Reign+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a1ca7b18606c9cce3593a0321609f06d2fe1582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,28,167,177,134,6,201,204,227,89,58,3,33,96,159,6,210,254,21,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
