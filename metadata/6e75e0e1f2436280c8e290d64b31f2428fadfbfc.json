He remixed the xx's &quot;Islands,&quot; Charlotte Gainsbourg's &quot;Heaven Can Wait,&quot; and a piece of Phillip Glass' Einstein on the Beach, and he also produced Kendrick Lamar's &quot;Cloud 10.&quot; Given that activity, the mellowness and restraint of his second album is surprising. A pair of collaborations with vocalists actually heightens its pained, private sound; they both convey the feeling of regretfully watching a relationship slip away. &quot;Eclipse/Blue,&quot; featuring Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino, switches from anxious thumps to hovering textures, while &quot;Try,&quot; featuring Chaz Bundick (Toro y Moi),&quot; is soft, fuzzy, and slightly off-center. Those appearances have a kind of lingering effect on the nine remaining tracks, all instrumentals. The glinting &quot;Glue&quot; and well-titled &quot;Snap&quot; excepted, they lack the muscle of Chung's earlier releases, but they're more evocative - detailed enough to withstand numerous plays whenever comforting, if downcast and unobtrusive, abstract hip-hop is sought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e75e0e1f2436280c8e290d64b31f2428fadfbfc","amp;dn":"Nosaj+Thing+-+Discography+%282006-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e75e0e1f2436280c8e290d64b31f2428fadfbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,117,224,225,242,67,98,128,200,226,144,214,75,49,242,66,143,173,251,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
