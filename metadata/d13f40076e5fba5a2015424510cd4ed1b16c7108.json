Strange light fixtures. Mutant cockroaches. There are some odd things about NateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new apartment. Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perfect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nag at him too much. At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbor across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And XelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment. And TimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. And VeekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends. Or the end of everything... &quot;Picture Lost in an apartment building with a cast of ordinary people, some comedy, plenty of charm, and the stakes being the end of the world, and you'd come close to capturing what makes 14 tick.&quot; - Craig DeLouie, author of The Infection and The Killing Floor.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio on MP3-CD; MP3 Una edition (May 7, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1469298651\nISBN-13: 978-1469298658\n\n| -------------------------------------------------------- |\n\nEx-Heroes (Unabridged) By Peter Clines [64 Kbps]\n__\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EOF1kNovL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EOF1kNovL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nStealth. Gorgon. Regenerator. Cerberus. Zzzap. The Mighty Dragon. They were heroes. Vigilantes. Crusaders for justice, using their superhuman abilities to make Los Angeles a better place. Then the plague of living death spread around the globe. Despite the best efforts of the superheroes, the police, and the military, the hungry corpses rose up and overwhelmed the country. The population was decimated, heroes fell, and the city of angels was left a desolate zombie wasteland like so many others. Now, a year later, the Mighty Dragon and his companions must overcome their differences and recover from their own scars to protect the thousands of survivors sheltered in their film studio-turned-fortress, the Mount. The heroes lead teams out to scavenge supplies, keep the peace within the walls of their home, and try to be the symbols the survivors so desperately need. For while the ex-humans walk the streets night and day, they are not the only threat left in the world, and the people of the Mount are not the only survivors left in Los Angeles. Across the city, another group has grown and gained power. And they are not heroes.

For most of that time, the superhero called St. George, formerly known to the world as the Mighty Dragon, has protected the people of Los Angeles at their film studio-turned-fortress, The Mount. Together with his fellow heroes Ã¢â‚¬â€ Cerberus, Zzzap, and Stealth Ã¢â‚¬â€ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried to give the survivors hope and something like a real life. But the swollen population of the Mount is becoming harder and harder to sustain, and the heroes are feeling the pressure. Hope arrives in the form of a United States Army battalion, based in a complex a few hundred miles away in Arizona. This is not just any base, however. The men and women of Project Krypton are super-soldiers, designed and created before the outbreak to be better, stronger, and faster than normal humans. They want the heroes and all the people of the Mount to rejoin America and have normal lives again. But can the military be trusted? And is there even a country left to rejoin? There is a secret at the heart of Project Krypton, and those behind it have an awesome power that will help them keep that secret hidden. The power of Freedom.

I WAS JUST BETTER PREPARED TO DO IT THAN MOST FOLKS.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In the years since the wave of living death swept the globe, St. George and his fellow heroes havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just kept Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last humans alive Ã¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created a real community, a bustling town thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spreading beyond its original walls and swelling with new refugees. But now one of the heroes, perhaps the most powerful among them, seems to be losing his mind. The implacable enemy known as Legion has found terrifying new ways of using zombies as pawns in his attacks. And outside the Mount, something ancient and monstrous is hell-bent on revenge. As Peter Clines weaves these elements together in yet another masterful, shocking climax, St. George, Stealth, Captain Freedom, and the rest of the heroes find that even in a city overrun by millions of ex-humans, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than one way to come back from the dead.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio on MP3-CD; MP3 Una edition (December 10, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1480564079\nISBN-13: 978-1480564077\n\n\n| -------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\nThe Junkie Quatrain By Peter Clines [80 Kbps]\n___\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51881JMVEmL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51881JMVEmL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nSix months ago, the world ended.\n\nThe Baugh Contagion swept across the planet. Its victims were left twitching, adrenalized cannibals that quickly became know as Junkies. Civilization crumbled as people created isolated safe havens to hide from the infected... and the possibly-infected.\n\nNow, as society nears a tipping point, lives will intersect and intertwine across two days in a desolate city. THE JUNKIE QUATRAIN is four tales of survival, and four types of post-apocalypse story. Because the end of the world means different things for different people. Loss. Opportunity. Hope. Or maybe just another day on the job.\n\nPublisher: Permuted Press (January 13, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B006XJW1AE\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
