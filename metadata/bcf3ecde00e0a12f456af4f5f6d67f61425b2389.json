In this installment of Illustrator CC for Web Design, Justin Seeley walks through everything to know about creating, using, and saving wireframes in Illustrator. Starting with a carefully chosen color scheme, Justin shows how to structure a wireframe in layers, develop templates for different devices, and create a library of ready-to-use UI elements, including multistate buttons and placeholders for media and forms. He then combines these elements in an example wireframe, and shows how to save versions of your file as the design evolves.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\nMiss part one?
