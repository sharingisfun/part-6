Choosing the right lamps for your home can be tough- just finding ones you like takes some doing, and they can be quite expensive. Why go through all that, when you can make your own? Crafting Wooden Lamps has plans for 24 great lamps and lighting projects that most woodworkers can complete in a weekend. The designs range from traditional to contemporary, and laidback to funky. A chapter on wiring shows exactly how to use easily-available lamp parts to hook things up safely.\n\n\nBy Ken Burton\nPublished by F+W Media in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 133 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e93dddd9f2ce6936c436242c3cd61c5571feb1","amp;dn":"Crafting+Wooden+Lamps%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e93dddd9f2ce6936c436242c3cd61c5571feb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,233,61,221,217,242,206,105,54,196,54,36,44,60,214,28,85,113,254,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
