Possible future directions of accretion are also discussed. The following main themes are covered: a historical perspective; physical models of accretion onto black holes of all masses; black hole fundamental parameters; and accretion, jets and outflows. An overview and outlook on the topic is also presented.\n\nThis volume summarizes the status of the study of astrophysical black hole research and is aimed at astrophysicists and graduate students working in this field.\n\nOriginally published in Space Science Reviews, Vol 183/1-4, 2014.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nThis title reviews in-depth research on accretion on all scales, from galactic binaries to intermediate mass and supermassive black holes.
