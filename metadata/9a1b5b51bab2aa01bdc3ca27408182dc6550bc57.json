While in Chicago for the 2008 Pitchfork Music Festival, Jarvis and his band tested out a few new songs in Albini's studio, and having liked the sound and the price, decided to return months later and record more material for the album. New songs like Angela and Fuckingsong suggest a heavier and livelier sound than his previous effort and show that Cocker has yet to find a song he can't inject his own observational wit into. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1b5b51bab2aa01bdc3ca27408182dc6550bc57","amp;dn":"Jarvis+Cocker+-+Further+Complications+%5Bmp3-160-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1b5b51bab2aa01bdc3ca27408182dc6550bc57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,27,91,81,186,178,170,1,189,195,202,39,64,129,130,220,101,80,188,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
