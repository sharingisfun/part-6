Born William Royce Scaggs in Ohio on June 8, 1944, he was raised in Oklahoma and Texas, and while attending prep school in Dallas met guitarist Steve Miller. Scaggs joined Miller's group the Marksmen as a vocalist in 1959, and the pair later attended the University of Wisconsin together, where they played in blues bands like the Ardells and the Fabulous Knight Trains. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.50% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tGray Cat Records\nCatalogue:\t\tGCD 4001\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Lowdown\n02.Slow Dancer\n03.Heart Of Mine\n04.It All Went Down The Drain\n05.Harbor Lights\n06.Jojo\n07.Ask Me 'Bout Nothin' But The Blues\n08.Breakdown Dead Ahead\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Look What You've Done To Me\n02.I Just Go\n03.Georgia\n04.Miss Sun\n05.Lido Shuffle\n06.Runnin' Blue\n07.Loan Me A Dime\n08.We're All Alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775a826c94ebc0fbbb1b410e92086da8f1e26d17","amp;dn":"Boz+Scaggs+-+Greatest+Hits+Live+2CD++%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775a826c94ebc0fbbb1b410e92086da8f1e26d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,90,130,108,148,235,192,251,187,27,65,14,146,8,109,168,241,226,109,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
