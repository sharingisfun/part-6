Robert Hastings, Maria Wall, &quot;Sustainable Solar Housing: Volume 2 - Exemplary Buildings and Technologies&quot;\nEarthscan Publications Ltd. | 2009-11 | ISBN: 1844078000, 1844073262 | 288 pages | PDF\n\nVolume 2 of this two-volume set offers a detailed analysis of exemplary buildings in different European countries and examines the various technologies employed. Aided by clear illustrations, it offers invaluable insights into the application of these technologies.\n\nThe Sustainable Solar Housing set examines a range of potential solutions for low-energy building design, considering different strategies (energy conservation and renewable energy) and technologies (relating to the building envelope, ventilation, heat delivery, heat production, heat storage, electricity and control). Each volume assesses the potential of these options in a variety of contexts, covering different housing types (apartment, row and detached) and different climate types (cold, temperate and mild). The impressive list of expert authors from 14 countries includes a mix of internationally respected academics and practitioners, working under the auspices of a five-year International Energy Agency (IEA) research project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b8bb2306a5ef87f1a0cd8755efb755da5803a4","amp;dn":"Sustainable+Solar+Housing+-+Vol++2+%282009%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b8bb2306a5ef87f1a0cd8755efb755da5803a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,184,187,35,6,165,239,135,241,160,205,135,85,239,183,85,218,88,3,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
