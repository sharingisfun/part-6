His work explores an individual's search for authenticity, self-knowledge and spirituality.\n\nSIDDHARTHA (1922) is a classic novel of self-discovery that has inspired generations of seekers.  With parallels to the enlightenment of the Buddha, the novel is the story of a young Brahmn's quest for the ultimate reality which takes him from the extremes of indulgent sensuality to the rigors of ascetism and self-denial.  Steeped in the tenets of both psychoanalysis and Eastern mysticism, Siddhartha presents a strikingly original view of man and culture, and the arduous process of self-discovery that leads to reconciliation, harmony and peace.\n\nSTEPPENWOLF (1927), combining autobiographical and psychoanalytic elements, reflects a profound crisis in Hesse's spiritual world during the 1920s while memorably portraying the protagonist's split between his humanity and his wolf-like aggression and homelessness.  The novel became an international success, although Hesse would later assert that the book was largely misunderstood.\n\n\n* SIDDHARTHA: An Indian Poem (Modern Library, 2006).
