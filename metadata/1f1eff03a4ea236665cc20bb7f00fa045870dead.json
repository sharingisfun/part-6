This allegorical tale is visually stunning and at times terrifying. Each scene is like a painting and the colors and costumes alone are worth the viewing.

The soundtrack is equally gorgeous, and the movie is utterly captivating. \n\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE! \n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE' \n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?
