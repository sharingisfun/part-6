The criminal gangs that had once made their homes there were forced out by the corporations that had taken over since the facility became an Independent Protectorate. Instead of the gentlemanly gang wars that had once dominated the scene, and made Hank's services prized as a negotiator, the city was now plagued by the clash of corporate armies using heavy weapons. Even tanks roamed the streets regularly. Most everyone from the olden days had either fled the station or was killed due to the organizational changes. Changes that Hank personally brought about when he had negotiated Belvaille's status with the Navy. As Hank contemplates whether he can survive in this increasingly hostile environment, he realizes that things aren't as bad as they seem - they are quite a bit worse. The constant power plays among corporations might have further reach than just the alleys of a backwater space station at the edge of the galaxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Liam Owen\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nLength: 9 hrs and 16 mins\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:10-24-14\r\nPublisher: Steven Campbell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db3c0cbc1c140635184f7a4ca4813ae36cfd2fc9","amp;dn":"Steven+Campbell+-+Basketful+of+Crap+%28Hard+Luck+Hank+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db3c0cbc1c140635184f7a4ca4813ae36cfd2fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,60,12,188,28,20,6,53,24,79,122,76,164,129,58,227,108,253,47,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
