Maybe not the exact image or line, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a rough idea of what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to write. So you begin writing your story with lots of enthusiasm...until you reach the middle, aka Act Two. \n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where you get stuck. Suddenly, all of your enthusiasm evaporates. Blank pages are scary in general. Blank pages from Act Two, those are downright terrifying. But if you figure out which events end Act TwoÃ¢â‚¬â€often referred to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“all is lostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ momentÃ¢â‚¬â€everything else will fall into place. If you do that, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be writing screenplay or novel pages quickly. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be good pages too. Pages which engage, excite, and enthrall. \n\nSo, WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Key to Plotting the Perfect Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Is LostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Moment?\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple: craft a sequence which is filled with pain, emotion, and paradox...what I like to call the heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“trough of hell.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Combined, these three elements re-engage audiences, right when their interest is about to flag.
