However this is not true. It is difficult to understand the Middle East only when the emphasis is not on oil and natural gas. If oil and natural gas are taken into account it is very easy to analyze the Middle East.\n\nBecause the Middle East is simply a region where the local players are fighting to sell their oil and natural gas, and the foreign players are fighting to buy this oil and natural gas. It might sound naÃƒÂ¯ve, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what the Middle East is about. It is only academics and specialists that need to know more about the Middle East.\n\nFor the general reader who simply wants to understand the Middle East wars, oil and natural gas will do the trick. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what this booklet is about. It clearly explains how the US, Russia and China are trying to control the oil and natural gas of the Middle East, and how Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar and Iraq are trying to sell their oil and natural gas.\n\nAfter reading the booklet, the reader will know the exact causes of the wars in Syria, Iraq and Libya. No prior knowledge is required","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd44c1c937513636a7121d87f481b8ce27ee2b9","amp;dn":"USA+Russia+and+China+in+the+Middle+East-+Alliances+and+Conflicts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd44c1c937513636a7121d87f481b8ce27ee2b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,212,76,28,147,117,19,99,106,113,33,216,127,72,27,140,226,126,226,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
