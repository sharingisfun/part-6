And we're doing it all on Windows 8 with WebMatrix 2.\n\nDescription\nThis is a different kind of production for us at Tekpub.\nWe're building out an application *that we need to use* and we're open sourcing it as well.\nWe use MongoDB quite often - and many times have wanted to work with a MongoDB explorer much like the RavenDB explorer built using Silverlight.\nWe can't stress it enough: this production is about building an app. It starts off explaining concepts, but quickly gets into the crazy-making aspects of working an app with Javascript.\n\nAuthored by: Rob Conery \nDuration: 4h 26m\nLevel: Intermediate\nReleased: 2/9/2013 \n\nVideo Details:\nWhat is BackboneJS Who Cares\t\t\t\t0:14:08\nWhat is BackboneJS and Why Use It\t\t\t7:09\nInstallation and Setup\t\t\t\t\t4:41\nGetting Started\t\t\t\t\t\t2:18\n\nA Simple View\t\t\t\t\t\t0:10:40\nGetting Started and A Simple View\t\t\t7:27\nWiring up a View Event\t\t\t\t\t1:25\nOrganizing and Summary\t\t\t\t\t1:48\n\nThe List View\t\t\t\t\t\t0:16:08\nCreating a List View\t\t\t\t\t10:36\nUsing a Template\t\t\t\t\t3:37\nOrganizing and Summary\t\t\t\t\t1:55\n\nCollections\t\t\t\t\t\t0:17:23\nWorking with Collections and Data\t\t\t8:01\nbind() and an Event Driven Model\t\t\t6:11\nRefactoring for Clarity\t\t\t\t\t3:11\n\nModels\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0:27:57\nWiring Up Add() Functionality\t\t\t\t11:15\nAdding a Delete() Function\t\t\t\t10:10\nUsing Validations\t\t\t\t\t6:32\n\nRefactor 1\t\t\t\t\t\t0:25:22\nRefactoring and Using Inheritance\t\t\t14:25\nNaming: Concepts and Conventions\t\t\t5:06\nA Cleaner View Structure\t\t\t\t5:51\n\nRouters\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0:41:09\nIntroduction to Complexity\t\t\t\t9:50\nAdding in a Router\t\t\t\t\t15:12\nThe App Layout and Reducing Duplication\t\t\t16:07\n\nGoing Around Backbone, Part 1\t\t\t\t0:18:58\nIntroduction and Adding in Mongo Documents-Dev Speed\t8:29\nEditing Documents with the Ace Editor\t\t\t10:29\n\nGoing Around Backbone, Part 2\t\t\t\t0:26:40\nCleaning Up: Paying Down Some Technical Debt\t\t5:02\nGetting the Ace Editor to Work Better\t\t\t7:25\nHooking Up the Real Document Data\t\t\t1:58\nAdding Save and Delete\t\t\t\t\t12:15\n\nPlugging in MarionetteJS\t\t\t\t1:08:20\nIntroduction\t\t\t\t\t\t5:14\nSetting Marionette Up\t\t\t\t\t5:44\nItem and List Views\t\t\t\t\t7:36\nAce Editor Conversion\t\t\t\t\t29:17:00\nMore Marionette Possibilities\t\t\t\t20:29\n\n\nIf you enjoy the video tutorial please support the author(s) by subscribing to pluralsight. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pluralsight.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pluralsight.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor requests and suggestions, Leave a comment and I will do my best to answer them all.\n\n--ognadrol09 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ognadrol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ognadrol&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50faa6644c07083d018b3a63cda88d3c2ea9aa99","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Application+Patterns+with+BackboneJS+%5BOGNADROL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50faa6644c07083d018b3a63cda88d3c2ea9aa99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,250,166,100,76,7,8,61,1,139,58,99,205,168,141,60,46,169,170,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
