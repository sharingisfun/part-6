In that same town, we meet Kevin (Matthew Settle), whose marketing &amp; design company is on the brink of shutting down due to the economy. Plus, KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife Jenny is in a difficult pregnancy with twins.\n\nThomas starts a new school and becomes the target of a bully who is threatened by how well Thomas plays basketball. Unable to join the high school team, Thomas goes to the community center where he meets Kevin and the two of them become unlikely friends through pickup basketball games.
