Lambesis' arrest negatively affected his relationships with As I Lay Dying, which resulted into the departure of all members exept for Jordan Mancino, who had been sharing an ownership for the band's rights with Lambesis since 2006. After a short meeting they decided to put the future on hold.[1][2]\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Wovenwar had been in the process of making a debut self-titled album with the producer Bill Stevenson. The mixing was done by Colin Richardson. The album is set to be released on August 5, 2014 through Metal Blade Records.[3] On April 21, 2014 the debut single &quot;All Rise&quot; saw the light of day. On June 18, 2014, the band released a second single called &quot;The Mason&quot;.[4]\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WovenwarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ track listing:\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ForewordÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“All RiseÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death To RightsÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“TempestÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The MasonÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moving UpÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sight Of ShoreÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Father / SonÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProfaneÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ArchersÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ruined EndsÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IdentityÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Matter Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProphetsÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“OnwardÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n\nAll songs are unfortunately 192kbps but it'll do until we can acquire a FLAC version.
