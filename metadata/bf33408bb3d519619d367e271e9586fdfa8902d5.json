The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community.[2]\n\n1.  &quot;Multinational Corporations&quot;  1:06\n2.  &quot;Instinct of Survival&quot;   \t2:26\n3.  &quot;The Kill&quot;   \t0:23\n4.  &quot;Scum&quot;   \t2:38\n5.  &quot;Caught...
