Although schools have different names for this course such as Math Analysis and Algebra 3, the concepts are the same and will provide you the background for anything you might encounter afterwards. Professor Vincent Selhorst-Jones will make sure you understand every concept and reinforce what you learned through many examples. This course includes other Educator instructors specializing in Trigonometry (Dr. William Murray) and Algebra 2 (Dr. Carleen Eaton) to make sure every aspect of Pre-Calculus is covered. Topics include everything from Functions and Partial Fractions to Logarithms, Probability, and Series. Professor Selhorst-Jones has been teaching 8+ years and double-majored in Mathematics and Theater at Pomona College, as well as received an M.F.A. in Acting from Harvard University.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14a1b5c6e8e525c8d5de35f1b2bbf4fcc05bf6b","amp;dn":"Educator+-+Pre-Calculus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14a1b5c6e8e525c8d5de35f1b2bbf4fcc05bf6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,74,27,92,110,142,82,92,141,93,227,95,27,43,191,79,204,5,191,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
