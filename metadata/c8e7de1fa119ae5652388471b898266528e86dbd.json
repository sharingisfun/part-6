Two brothers\nDemetrius Meech Flenory and Terry Southwest T Flenory\nran a drug enterprise that had 200 members and was\nconnected to one of the major Mexican cartels. In the Hip\nHop music industry they created a front company called BMF\nEntertainment, which was a perfect mix of drugs, violence\nand street cred that makes their story Hip-Hop s version\nof the Godfather\n\nBMF is a 80-minute documentary that explores the story of\nthe 15-year investigation by the DEA, FBI and an elite\ndrug task force called HIDTA that resulted in 41\ndefendants across the country being charged in one of the\nlargest drug conspiracy cases ever. The film is a tale\nthat combines the story of a criminal syndicate that lived\non a code of honor and conduct that rivaled any of the\nfive Mafia families, and ended just as dramatically under\na hailstorm of government informants, wiretaps and\nsurveillance that ultimately caused the downfall of the\nHip-Hop Drug Empire\n\nWith over 11,000 government documents and close to 5,000\nphotographs and taped conversations the BMF is a\ndocumentary that will deconstruct the story of BMF from\nboth the law enforcement angle and from members inside BMF\nthat had intimate knowledge of the operation. The film\nwill include interviews with: informants, DEA Agents\nDistrict Attorney s, FBI, Atlanta Police and rare insights\nfrom Hip-Hop heavyweights, Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, Rick\nRoss, Fabolous, and many others. While many articles have\nbeen written in the press about BMF, BMF is a film on two\nbrothers that were able to fuse an organized crime network\nwith a company that purveyed Hip-Hop hype, the ultimate\ngangster tale\n\nWe're back!
