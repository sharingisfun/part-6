The band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King.[1] Slayer rose to fame with their 1986 release, Reign in Blood, which has been called &quot;the heaviest album of all time&quot; by Kerrang!.[2] The band is credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Anthrax and Megadeth.[3]\n\nSlayer's musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, atonal guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, Satanism, religion and warfare have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public.\n\nSince their debut record in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one box set, four videos, two extended plays, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received three Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot;, and one in 2008 for the song &quot;Final Six&quot;. They have headlined music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow No Mercy 1983\n\n\nShow No Mercy is the debut album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released in December 1983 through Metal Blade Records. Brian Slagel signed the band to Metal Blade after watching the band perform the song &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; by Iron Maiden. The band was forced to self-finance their debut album, combining the savings of vocalist Tom Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King's father.\n\nTouring extensively promoting the album, the band brought close friends and family members along the trip, who helped backstage with lighting and sound. Although criticized for poor production quality, it became Metal Blade Records highest selling release, also producing the songs &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; and &quot;Black Magic&quot;, which are played at Slayer's live shows regularly.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;The Antichrist&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Die By the Sword&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Fight Till Death&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Metal Storm/Face the Slayer&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Black Magic&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Tormentor&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;The Final Command&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Crionics&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Show No Mercy&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHell Awaits 1985\n\n\nHell Awaits is the second studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer, released through Metal Blade Records in 1985. The band's previous release, Show No Mercy, became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release; as a result, producer Brian Slagel desired to release a second Slayer album. To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (Show No Mercy was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.\n\nLyrical themes on Hell Awaits are darker than on Show No Mercy, and included hell and Satan.[2] Musically, the album features the band's most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases. Defined as &quot;influential to future extreme metal acts,&quot; the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re-recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums.[3] Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan cite Hell Awaits as an influence.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Hell Awaits&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Kill Again&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Praise of Death&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Necrophiliac&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Crypts of Eternity&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Hardening of the Arteries&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReign in Blood 1986\n\n\nReign in Blood is the third studio album and major label debut by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on October 7, 1986, the album was the band's first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band's sound evolve. Reign in Blood was very well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. Kerrang! magazine described the record as &quot;the heaviest album of all time,&quot; and a breakthrough in thrash metal and speed metal.\n\nReign in Blood's release was delayed because of concerns regarding its graphic artwork and lyrical subject matter. The opening track, &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, which refers to Josef Mengele and describes acts, such as human experimentation, that Mengele committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, provoked allegations of Nazism.[6] However, the band stated numerous times they do not condone Nazism, and are merely interested in the subject.[7] The album was Slayer's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 94, and was awarded gold certification on November 20, 1992.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Angel of Death&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Piece by Piece&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Necrophobic&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Altar of Sacrifice&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Jesus Saves&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Criminally Insane&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Reborn&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Epidemic&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Postmortem&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Raining Blood&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth of Heaven  1988\n\n\nSouth of Heaven is the fourth studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band's second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer's previous album Reign in Blood had helped the band's sound evolve.\n\nSouth of Heaven was Slayer's second album to enter the Billboard 200, and its last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia Records's refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. In order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album's tempo. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilised undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more accustomed to the style of earlier releasesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were disappointed. Despite this, the songs &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; and the title track became permanent features of the band's live setlist.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;South of Heaven&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Silent Scream&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Live Undead&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Behind the Crooked Cross&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Ghosts of War&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Read Between the Lies&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Cleanse the Soul&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot; (Judas Priest cover)\n10.\t&quot;Spill the Blood&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasons in the Abyss 1990\n\n\nSeasons in the Abyss is the fifth studio album by the thrash metal band Slayer. It was released in 1990 through Def American Records, and later through American Recordings after the company changed its name. It was Dave Lombardo's last studio album with Slayer, until his return in 2006 with the release of Christ Illusion. Seasons in the Abyss is Slayer's third major record label release. Seasons in the Abyss is one of few albums to be issued with a Parental Advisory label despite the virtual absence of profanity unlike other Slayer albums, though the lyrics depict violent acts.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;War Ensemble&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Blood Red&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Spirit in Black&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Expendable Youth&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Hallowed Point&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Skeletons of Society&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Temptation&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Born of Fire&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivine Intervention 1994\n\n\nDivine Intervention is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on September 27, 1994 through American Recordings, it was the first Slayer album featuring Paul Bostaph, replacing the band's original drummer Dave Lombardo. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 chart, with 93,000 copies sold in its first week,[1] and later that year was certified gold in Canada and United States.\n\n1.\t&quot;Killing Fields&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Sex.

The album is a collection of punk covers of bands like Minor Threat, T.S.O.L., D.I. and Iggy Pop. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman used two of the four punk songs he had written in 1984 and 1985 as part of a side project called Pap Smear, while King and vocalist Tom Araya wrote an original song titled &quot;Gemini&quot;. Released on May 28, 1996 through American Recordings, Undisputed Attitude peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Disintegration&quot;\n&quot;Free Money&quot;  \n\n2.\t&quot;Verbal Abuse&quot;\n&quot;Leeches&quot;  \n\n3.\t&quot;Abolish Government&quot;\n&quot;Superficial Love&quot;  \n\n4.\t&quot;Can't Stand You&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Ddamm&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Guilty of Being White&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;I Hate You&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Filler&quot;\n&quot;I Don't Want to Hear It&quot;  \n\n9.\t&quot;Spiritual Law&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Mr. Freeze&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Violent Pacification&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Richard Hung Himself&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;I'm Gonna Be Your God&quot; (parody tribute of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;)\n14.\t&quot;Gemini&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabolus in Musica  1998\n\n\nDiabolus in Musica is the eighth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on June 9, 1998, it is the second studio album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph. Although receiving mixed critical reviews, the album sold 46,000 copies in its first week to peak at number 31 on the Billboard 200.\n\nGuitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote most of the album's content which has been described as Slayer's most experimental album. The album's title is a Latin term for &quot;The Devil In Music&quot;, a musical interval known for its dissonance. Lyrical themes explored on the album include religion, deviants, death, maniacs, war, and serial killers.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Bitter Peace&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Death's Head&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Stain of Mind&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Overt Enemy&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Perversions of Pain&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Love to Hate&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Desire&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;In the Name of God&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Scrum&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Screaming from the Sky&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Wicked&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Point&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod Hates Us All 2001\n\n\nGod Hates Us All is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on September 11, 2001, the album received mixed critical reviews, although it entered the Billboard 200 at number 28. Recorded in three months at The Warehouse Studio in Canada, God Hates Us All includes the Grammy Award-nominated &quot;Disciple&quot; and is the band's last album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph.\n\nGuitarist Kerry King wrote approximately 80% of the lyrics, adopting a different approach from earlier recordings by including prevalent themes such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. Limiting the lyrics to topics which everyone could relate to, King wished to explore more in depth, realistic subject matter. The band experimented musically by recording two songs with seven-string guitars, and a further two with drop B tunings. The album's release was delayed due to the graphic nature of its artwork for which slip covers were created to cover the original artwork, difficulties encountered during audio mixing, and the change of distributor by the band's record label during the release period.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Darkness of Christ&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Disciple&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;God Send Death&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;New Faith&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Cast Down&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Threshold&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Exile&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Seven Faces&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Bloodline&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Deviance&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;War Zone&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Here Comes the Pain&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Payback&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrist Illusion 2006\n\n\nChrist Illusion is the tenth studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on August 8, 2006, the album received generally favorable critical reviews, and it entered the Billboard 200 at number 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the band's highest U.S. chart position to date. Christ Illusion includes the Grammy Award-winning songs &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; and &quot;Final Six&quot;, and is the band's first studio album to feature original drummer Dave Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss.\n\nDepicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator Larry Carroll, the album's graphic artwork courted controversy. An alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original. Lyrical themes, particularly in the song &quot;Jihad&quot; which describes the September 11 attacks from a terrorist perspective, outraged the Mumbai-based Catholic Secular Forum in India. As a result, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by EMI India.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Flesh Storm&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Catalyst&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Skeleton Christ&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Jihad&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Consfearacy&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Catatonic&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Black Serenade&quot; (Alternate Version)\n9.\t&quot;Cult&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Supremist&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Final Six&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Painted Blood 2009\n\n\nWorld Painted Blood is the eleventh studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released by American Recordings/Sony Music on November 3, 2009. The album was produced by Greg Fidelman and executive produced by Rick Rubin.\n\nIn May 2009, Kerry King said of the album: &quot;I think this one has a little bit of everythingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more so than anything we've done since Seasons. So I would imagine people are gonna compare it to that one.&quot;[12] The band had recorded thirteen songs for the album, seven written by Jeff Hanneman and six by King, although not all of them were included.[12] Kerry King later confirmed the album's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009.[13] A recent article on Slayer's website has confirmed the name of the band's 10th studio album is World Painted Blood.[14] World Painted Blood marks the first time Slayer wrote and prepared the material for the album while in the studio. In the past, most or all of the songs had been worked out by the time the band entered the studio to record the material. Dave Lombardo said in an interview on Capital Chaos &quot;The other albums were good, but this one there's some kind of magic that I can't put my finger on, it just flows really well, the structuring is done well, the melodies are done well. Everything has been a collective effort so I'm definitely proud of it and I'm sure the other guys are too.&quot;[15] On August 20, 2009, Roadrunner Records confirmed the track listing[16] On September 15, 2009, the artwork for the album was revealed. It will be released with four different covers that when put together, create a world map covered in blood.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;World Painted Blood&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Unit 731&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Snuff&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Beauty Through Order&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Hate Worldwide&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Public Display of Dismemberment&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Human Strain&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Americon&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Psychopathy Red&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Playing With Dolls&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Not of This God&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Undead  1985\n\n\nLive Undead is a live album by the thrash metal band Slayer. It was recorded during a rehearsal in New York in 1984 live in a studio in front of 50 of their friends. The CD was released through Metal Blade Records in 1985. Bobby Steele of The Undead named an album Live Slayer after hearing this album.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Black Magic&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Die by the Sword&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Captor of Sin&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;The Antichrist&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Show No Mercy&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Aggressive Perfector&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecade of Aggression 1991\n\n\nDecade of Aggression is a double live album by Slayer, released in 1991 through Def American Records (later renamed to American Recordings). The album reached #55 in the Billboard Top 200. A numbered limited edition (of 10,000 copies) was also released with the CDs contained in a metal case, a booklet with exclusive photographs, and two additional live songs, &quot;Skeletons of Society&quot; and &quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\t&quot;Hell Awaits&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;The Antichrist&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;War Ensemble&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;South of Heaven&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Raining Blood&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Altar of Sacrifice&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Jesus Saves&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Angel of Death&quot;\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n1.\t&quot;Hallowed Point&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Blood Red&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Die by the Sword&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Black Magic&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Captor of Sin&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Born of Fire&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Postmortem&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Spirit in Black&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Expendable Youth&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Chemical Warfare&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaunting the Chapel 1984 EP\n\n\nHaunting the Chapel is an EP released by the thrash metal band Slayer in 1984 through Metal Blade and Enigma Records. Slayer's debut album Show No Mercy became Metal Blade's highest selling, leading to producer Brian Slagel wanting to release an EP. Recorded in Hollywood the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet, although it resulted in drummer Dave Lombardo meeting Gene Hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed.[1]\n\nAlthough originally featuring three songs, the record evidences a marked evolution from the style of their previous album, Show No Mercy, and is considered the first demonstration of the band's &quot;classic&quot; style displayed on later albums and a &quot;stepping stone.&quot;[2] The songs &quot;Captor of Sin&quot; and &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; are regularly featured on the band's live set list.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n&quot;Chemical Warfare&quot;  \n&quot;Captor of Sin&quot;  \n&quot;Haunting the Chapel&quot;\n&quot;Aggressive Perfector&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes 2 Bootlegs as well.
