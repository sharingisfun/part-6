If you're wondering what 2012 collection Gems: The Very Best Of can offer what the other 20-odd flooding the market haven't already, the answer is not a lot. Indeed, apart from the substitution of &quot;That's What Love Is All About&quot; for his take on Bill Withers' &quot;Lean on Me,&quot; its 17 tracks are exactly the same as his hugely successful Greatest Hits 1985-1995 (albeit in a different order). It therefore means that the 11 studio albums he's recorded since are entirely ignored, but with only one of his 17 U.S. Top 40 hits (&quot;Go the Distance&quot;) charting outside that time frame, it remains to be seen whether the lack of recent material should be an issue. Unsurprisingly the bulk of the track list comes from his late 80s/early 90s heyday, from the long-haired power balladry of &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You?&quot; to his renditions of soul classics from Percy Sledge (&quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;), and Ray Charles (&quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;) to his soft rock uptempo songs like &quot;How Can We Be Lovers?&quot; and &quot;Time, Love and Tenderness.&quot; Bolton's star had started to wane by the mid-'90s, and while several of the tracks recorded specially for his first major-label retrospective, such as the unadulterated schmaltz of &quot;I Promise You&quot; and &quot;A Love So Beautiful&quot; explain why, the cheekily seductive world-pop of &quot;Can I Touch YouÃ¢â‚¬Â¦There?&quot; and a straight-forward rendition of &quot;I Found Someone&quot; (the track he penned for Cher) are arguably two of his best songs. Tacked on as a bonus disc, the 2011 duets collection Gems shows he can still belt it out with the best of them, particularly the covers of U2's &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; and Joe Cocker's &quot;You Are So Beautiful.&quot; But casual fans will be more concerned with the first hits-packed disc, which may do its job, but ultimately, is indistinguishable from the mountain of similar compilations.\nAll Music Review by Jon O'Brien\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Soul Provider\n[02] (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\n[03] How Am I Supposed to Live Without You\n[04] How Can We Be Lovers\n[05] When I'm Back On My Feet Again\n[06] Georgia On My Mind\n[07] Time, Love And Tenderness\n[08] When a Man Loves a Woman\n[09] Missing You Now\n[10] Steel Bars\n[11] Said I Loved You...But I Lied\n[12] Lean On Me\n[13] Can I Touch You...There\n[14] I Promise You\n[15] I Found Someone\n[16] A Love So Beautiful\n[17] This River\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:14m:50s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Love Is Everything - - - Featuring Rascal Flatts\n[02] Fields Of Gold - - - Featuring Eva Cassidy\n[03] Sajna - - - Featuring A.
