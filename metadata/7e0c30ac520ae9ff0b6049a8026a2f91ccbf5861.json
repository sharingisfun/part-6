Only when she's completely run out of displacement activities does she actually write.\nFollow Jill on Twitter at @JillMansell.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0c30ac520ae9ff0b6049a8026a2f91ccbf5861","amp;dn":"Jill+Mansell+Books%2813%29-epub%2Cmobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0c30ac520ae9ff0b6049a8026a2f91ccbf5861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,12,48,172,82,10,233,255,11,96,73,168,2,106,47,145,204,191,88,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
