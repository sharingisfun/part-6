This chapter will be especially of interest to anyone wondering if a hereditary element exists for intelligence.\n\n\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how different groups of humans have transformed in the last 10,000 years, this book is a must read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3aa8b95877ef920567b28ce5bf5def16975ec2","amp;dn":"The+10%2C000+Year+Explosion.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3aa8b95877ef920567b28ce5bf5def16975ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,58,168,185,88,119,239,146,5,103,178,140,229,191,93,239,22,151,94,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
