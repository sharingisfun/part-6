Cicero (106-43 BC) said: &quot;The face is a picture of the mind as the eyes are its interpreter.&quot; To capture a person's personality, there are so many things to keep in mind and the authors of Faces show us how to match up a personality with lighting, posing, and composition. Portraiture is truly an art and this book dives deep into the details so that you end up with a gorgeous portrait that both you and your subject love.\n\nNot only is this book the most comprehensive available on portraiture, but it contains stunning images. Each image is paired with a lighting diagram, a description of why the type of image was chosen, and then takes you through postproduction to put the finishing touches on. The authors also take things a step further by showing you some of the most famous portraits taken and how the techniques of these portraits were obtained.\n\n\n* gorgeous photos with detailed information on how they were done\n* wide breadth of portraits -- from street shots to studio shots\n* totally comprehensive how-to including composition, posing, lighting, and even legal and model info ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b1be1d7c064e1ea89f617a3f6ec73c6bab73da","amp;dn":"FACES%3A+Photography+and+the+Art+of+Portraiture+-Biver-+PDF+%5BSlend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b1be1d7c064e1ea89f617a3f6ec73c6bab73da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,177,190,29,124,6,78,30,168,159,97,122,63,110,199,60,107,171,115,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
