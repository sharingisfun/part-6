Mutineer's Moon (1991)\r\n2. The Armageddon Inheritance (1993)\r\n3. Heirs of Empire (1996)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 - Mutineer's Moon\r\n\r\nMUTINY . . .\r\n\r\nFor Lt.  Commander Colin Maclntyre, it began as a routine training flight over  the Moon. For Dahak, a self-aware Imperial battleship, it began  millennia ago when that powerful artificial intelligence underwent a  mutiny in the face of the enemy. The mutiny was never resolved-Dahak was  forced to maroon not just the mutineers but the entire crew on  prehistoric Earth.\r\n\r\nDahak has been helplessly waiting as the  descendants of the loyal crew regressed while the mutineers maintained  control of technology that kept them alive as the millennia passed. But  now Dahak's sensors indicate that the enemy that devastated the Imperium  so long ago has returned-and Earth is in their path. For the sake of  the planet, Dahak must mobilize its defenses. And that it cannot do  until the mutineers are put down. So Dahak has picked Colin Maclntyre to  be its new captain. Now Maclntyre must mobilize humanity to destroy the  mutineers once and for all-or Earth will become a cinder in the path of  galactic conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 - Armageddon Inheritance\r\n\r\nJob Pressure . . .\r\n\r\nColin MacIntyre's Life as a NASA astronaut might not have been  exciting, but at least it was orderly. Unfortunately, He's been tapped  for greater things, and he isn't too sure he likes it.\r\n\r\nFirst he  was kidnapped by an ancient, self-aware starship masquerading as Earth's  Moon. Then he was drafted as its captain to suppress a  five-thousand-year old mutiny. And then he had to mobilize the planet  against the attack of an eons-old alien menace dedicated to the  eradication of all intelligent life in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to  blame him for feeling a little stressed but there's something Colin  MacIntyre doesn't know about all the things he's had to do.\r\n\r\nThey were the easy part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 - Heirs of Empire\r\n\r\nThe Boss's Kids . . .\r\n\r\nFor really tough jobs, Emperor Colin the First is your man. The Only  person in the galaxy ever to stop the genocidal Achuutani, he went on  from there to resurrect an empire that died forty-five thousand years  ago. He's still got a few problemsâ€”like a traitor out to murder him and  three-quarters of a billion of his subjectsâ€”but if anyone can handle the  job, it's Colin.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the galaxy better brace  itself, because his progeny are on the way. Not that Sean and Harriet  aren't nice kids; it's just that they've had a bad day. They're a long  way from home, marooned with a blown up starship that's left them  stranded on a theocratic world of gunpowder and pikes, and Mother Church  of that world doesn't like them very much. In fact, she's declared them  demons, proclaimed Holy War, marshalled the Holy Host, and ordered them  exterminated.\r\n\r\nYou might think that things look pretty bleak for  the kids, but in reality it's Mother Church that's in troubleâ€”because  Sean and Harry are chips off the old blockâ€”and they're about to get  angry....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460fa73aab99853ae1589920dad101dcfad0d1f7","amp;dn":"David+Weber+-+Empire+From+the+Ashes+%28Dahak+%231-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460fa73aab99853ae1589920dad101dcfad0d1f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,15,167,58,171,153,133,58,225,88,153,32,218,209,1,220,250,208,209,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
