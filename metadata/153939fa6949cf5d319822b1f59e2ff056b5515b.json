Looney Tunes series of cartoons. The character appeared in only\nfive shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons closed down in 1964, but marketing and\ntelevision appearances later propelled the character to new popularity in the 1990s.\nAs the youngest of the Looney Tunes, the Tasmanian Devil, or 'Taz' as he has come to\nbe known, is generally portrayed as a dim-witted omnivore with a notoriously short temper\nand little patience. He will eat anything and everything, with an appetite that seems\nto know no bounds. He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls\nand rasps, and his ability to spin and bite through just about anything.\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED!!!!!!\n\nMORE TO COME!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153939fa6949cf5d319822b1f59e2ff056b5515b","amp;dn":"Tasmanian+Devil+Pack+%281957-1993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153939fa6949cf5d319822b1f59e2ff056b5515b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,57,57,250,105,73,207,93,49,152,34,177,245,158,47,240,86,181,81,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
