I have uploaded Star ocean the first departure. It is a remake of the original star ocean that release on the SNES only in Japan.  Included is YACC (Yet another iso compressor) witch will allow you to compress the game in a format that the psp will still read.  I also included the full version of winrar for extracting the files.\n\nYou will need to be running Custom firmware to run the game.  I have tested it on dark alex's 4.01 m33-2.  to learn more about hacking the psp see &lt;a href=&quot;\nHttp://www.psp-hacks.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nHttp://www.psp-hacks.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nHttp://www.pspbrew.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nHttp://www.pspbrew.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo play game just drop the &quot;SOTFD.iso&quot; into the ISO folder in the root of your memory card.\n\nEnjoy the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070ab153c125d385296e2cee9788c9fef4a91541","amp;dn":"PSP+Star+Ocean+The+First+Departure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070ab153c125d385296e2cee9788c9fef4a91541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,10,177,83,193,37,211,133,41,110,44,238,151,136,201,254,244,169,21,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
