For more information on Level 42 read the page on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_42\n\nI have made the best discography I can, I know there's maybe a few little bits here and there that aren't included but there's a lot of releases for this band so it's hard to include everything. All the albums are there, I've added the best compilations that I think and I have added a few live albums also that I've created myself mostly. There's a couple of solo project albums from Mark King included. I have encoded all the mp3s for this collection in 320kbps CBR format at 44.1Khz. They all sound superb, you won't find a better sounding discography anywhere else. I have also included all the album artwork that I can and I've tagged every single track correctly and also added the album cover artwork for each one so that it looks better on an mp3 player if you choose to listen to them on one.\n\nI hope that if you do download this then please give back and seed to the others that are also downloading it. It will help to keep the torrent popular and I'm sure that lots of people will then be able to enjoy this collection.\n\nHope that you enjoy listening to this band, I think they're excellent for a Jazz Fusion/Pop band. I think they have a very funky sound and their bass player Mark King is a superb bassist, certainly one of the best bass players on the planet.\n\n(1981) Level 42 - Level 42\n(1982) Level 42 - The Early Tapes\n(1982) Level 42 - The Pursuit Of Accidents\n(1983) Level 42 - Standing In The Light\n(1984) Level 42 - True Colours\n(1985) Level 42 - World Machine\n(1987) Level 42 - Running In The Family\n(1988) Level 42 - Staring At The Sun\n(1991) Level 42 - Guaranteed\n(1994) Level 42 - Forever Now\n(1995) Level 42 - Forever Now [Resurgence]\n(2006) Level 42 - Retroglide\n(2007) Level 42 - World Machine [Deluxe Edition]  CD 1\n(2007) Level 42 - World Machine [Deluxe Edition]  CD 2\n(1989) Level 42 - Level Best\n(1992) Level 42 - The Remixes\n(1998) Level 42 - The Very Best Of Level 42\n(2002) Level 42 - The Ultimate Collection  CD 1\n(2002) Level 42 - The Ultimate Collection  CD 2\n(2006) Level 42 - The Definitive Collection\n(2013) Level 42 - Sirens\n(1983) Level 42 - Level 42 At Rockpalast  CD 1 - Zeche Bochum 29-10-83\n(1983) Level 42 - Level 42 At Rockpalast  CD 2 - Zeche Bochum 29-10-83\n(1984) Level 42 - Level 42 At Rockpalast  CD 3 - Grugahalle Essen 13-10-84\n(1985) Level 42 - A Physical Presence\n(1986) Level 42 - Live At Wembley\n(2000) Level 42 - A Physical Presence  CD 1\n(2000) Level 42 - A Physical Presence  CD 2\n(2001) Level 42 - Live 2001 At Reading UK  CD 1\n(2001) Level 42 - Live 2001 At Reading UK  CD 2\n(2009) Level 42 - Live In Holland 2009  CD 1\n(2009) Level 42 - Live In Holland 2009  CD 2\n(1984) Mark King - Influences\n(1999) Mark King - One Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f33681c6c42a354f8b55b2460ee4002217d6135","amp;dn":"Level+42+-+The+Complete+Discography+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f33681c6c42a354f8b55b2460ee4002217d6135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,51,104,28,108,66,163,84,248,181,91,36,96,238,64,2,33,125,97,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
