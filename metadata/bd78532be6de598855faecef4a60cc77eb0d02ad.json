Normally I'd get all these runs pretty easily from there (Thanks, you MPAA anti-piracy douche bags).\n\nI went on a hunt today from various sites to get all three creator's complete comic runs, and after hours of painstaking searching and renaming, I hit the jackpot!\nSo HERE IT IS, folks! This is my tribute to DEMONOID, that had the best comic collection online that I'd seen. All three full creators' runs. \n\nThis is Part 2:\n\nMatt Fraction's COMPLETE run on Invincible Iron Man\n\nThe way it goes is this: Issue 1 to 33, then theres a renumbering to issue 500, and it then goes on from issue 500 to 527. Also included are the one shot Rescue and Invincible Iron Man Annual number 1\n\nENJOY! And I hope this works. Comments, and criticisms highly appreciated! All credit goes to the original scanners! ROck on, u awesome ppls!\n\nPLEASE SEED!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd78532be6de598855faecef4a60cc77eb0d02ad","amp;dn":"Invincible+Iron+Man+-+Matt+Fraction+%28COMPLETE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd78532be6de598855faecef4a60cc77eb0d02ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,120,83,43,230,222,89,136,85,250,236,239,74,96,204,119,235,13,2,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
