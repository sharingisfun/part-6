His singular vision embraces everything from blues to tin-pan-alley to jazz to just about anything else you can think of. Grammy winner, actor, poet, a master of the musical collage and lyrical surprise, Tom Waits is simply a giant. \n\nMule Variations offers the most complete picture of Tom Waits of any of his albums. Edgy stomps, humor and experimentation are interspersed with some of the most beautiful and personal songs he's ever written.\n\nIt was Waits's first studio album since 1992's Bone Machine (the later The Black Rider was a collection of songs originally written for a play). It won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album and was nominated for Best Male Rock Performance for the track &quot;Hold On&quot;. It also sold more than 500,000 copies world wide.\n\nThe album was backed by an extensive tour of Europe and North America during the summer and autumn of 1999, which was Waits's first proper tour since 1987. Other promotional stops included a solo performance on VH1 Storytellers.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 416 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTom Waits - vocals, The Voice, Guitar, Piano, Organ, Pump Organ, percussion, Chamberlin, Optigan \nAndrew Borger - drums, Percussion\nKathleen Brennan - Boner \nRalph Carney - Trumpet, Sax, Alto-Sax, Bass Clarinet, Reeds \nLes Claypool - Bass\nGreg Cohen - Bass, Percussion \nLinda Deluca-Ghidossi - Violin \nDalton Dillingham III - Bass \nJoe Gore - Guitar \nChris Grady - Trumpet \nJohn Hammond - Blues Harp \nStephen Hodges - Percussion \nSmokey Hormel - Guitar, Dobro, Chumbus &amp; Dousengoni \nJacquire King - Programming \nLarry LaLonde - Guitar \nBrain Mantia - Drums \nChristopher Marvin - Drums \nCharlie Musselwhite - Blues Harp\nNik Phelps - Bari-Sax \nDJ M.
