Selected, edited and translated by Norman Solomon.  896 pp. -- ePUB + MOBI\n\n\nThe Talmud is one of the most significant religious texts in the world, second only to the Bible in its importance to Judaism.  It is a compilation of the teachings of major Jewish scholars from the classic period of rabbinic Judaism.  In a range of styles including commentary, parables, proverbs and anecdotes, it provides guidance on all aspects of everyday life from ownership to commerce to relationships, and is the basis for all codes of Jewish law.\n\nThis selection of its most illuminating passages makes accessible to modern readers the centuries of Jewish thought contained within.  Norman Solomon's lucid translation from the Bavli (Babylonian) Talmud is accompanied by an introduction on its arrangement, social and historical background, reception, and authors.  This edition also includes appendixes of background information, a glossary, time line, maps and indexes.\n\nThank you to the original uploader!\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
