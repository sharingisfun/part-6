It was one of the first musicals to feature a Technicolor sequence, which sparked the trend of color being used in a flurry of musicals that would hit the screens in 1929-1930. Today the Technicolor sequence is presumed lost and only a black and white copy survives in the complete film. The film was the first musical released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was Hollywood's first all-talking musical.\n\nThe film was written by Norman Houston and James Gleason from a story by Edmund Goulding, and directed by Harry Beaumont. Original music was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, including the popular hit &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot;. The George M. Cohan classic &quot;Give My Regards To Broadway&quot; is used under the opening establishing shots of New York City, its film debut. Bessie Love was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\nThe Broadway Melody was a substantial success. It was the top grossing picture of 1929, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Historically, it is often considered the first complete example of the Hollywood musical. However, the film has since come to be seen as weak, clichÃƒÂ©-ridden, and overly melodramatic. Even in 1929, the creaky stereotypes of backstage show biz were something less than fresh.[citation needed] Most believe that the primary reason for its success in the Academy Awards was due to the films with which it competed being equally unimpressive.[citation needed] Filmsite.org describes the 1929 Oscars as follows: &quot;The films nominated for this year's awards were some of the weakest films in the history of American cinema, reflecting the chaos of the transition from silents to sound films.&quot;\n\nThe Broadway Melody won an Academy Award for best picture, the first talking picture to receive the award. Within the next ten years, MGM made three other films with a similar title and plot (Broadway Melody of 1936, Broadway Melody of 1938, &amp; Broadway Melody of 1940) and remade the original 1929 version in 1940 as Two Girls on Broadway.\n\nCAST:-\nCharles King\nAnita Page\nBessie Love\nJed Prouty \nKenneth Thomson \nMary Doran \n\nProducer: Irving Thalberg\nDirector: Harry Beaumont\nScreenplay: Edmund Goulding\nOriginal Music: Nacio Herb Brown\nlyrics by Arthur Freed except as noted\n\nMusical numbers\n&quot;Broadway Melody&quot;\n&quot;Love Boat&quot;\n&quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot;\n&quot;Wedding of the Painted Doll&quot;\n&quot;Boy Friend&quot;\n&quot;Truthful Deacon Brown&quot;, music and lyrics by Willard Robison\n&quot;Lovely Lady&quot;\n\nMOVIE REVIEW:- The Broadway Melody (1929)\nThe plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister (Harriet alias Hank) is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister (Queenie). Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous &quot;stage door Johnny.&quot;\n\nThe movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Broadway Melody.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He tells some chorus girls heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis ZanfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting EddieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not interested but he says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll give them time to think it over.\n\nEddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for ZanfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revue to present their act. Zanfield isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend HankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Broadway MelodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques Ã¢â‚¬Å“JockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.\n\nOver the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart, runs off to Jock once again.\n\nHank, after witnessing QueenieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the least she could do after all heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.\n\nSometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 100 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 100 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dafbc07088c8b732ee545edf355f61ad9e00d3d","amp;dn":"The+Broadway+Melody+%281929%29+Xvid+1cd+-+First+Musical+to+Win+Oscar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dafbc07088c8b732ee545edf355f61ad9e00d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,175,188,7,8,140,139,115,46,229,69,237,243,85,246,26,217,224,13,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
