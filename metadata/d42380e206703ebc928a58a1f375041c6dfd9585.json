The specialized literature, old and new, is considerable, and is being added to constantly. Newly discovered facts correct old errors, expand our horizon and give us new insight. The kind of research that rounds out and fills in the lesser areas has no effect on the total development, which is the topic of this book.

The names of specialists identified with particular points of view have been indicated in the text; essential publications are listed in the bibliography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42380e206703ebc928a58a1f375041c6dfd9585","amp;dn":"The+History+of+Western+Art+by+Erwin+O.+Christensen+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42380e206703ebc928a58a1f375041c6dfd9585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,35,128,226,6,112,62,188,146,138,88,161,243,117,4,28,109,253,149,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
