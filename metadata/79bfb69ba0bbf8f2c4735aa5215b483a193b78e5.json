Wish you could know what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re getting into when you say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI doÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? Now, with Things I Wish IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Known Before We Got Married, you can. Dr. Gary Chapman, #1 New York Times best-selling author of The 5 Love LanguagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, has spent the last thirty-five years counseling couples. In Things I Wish IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Known Before We Got Married, he shares what he and these couples have learned from experience. \n\nAmong the twelve things you should know: that being in love is not enough to make a successful marriage, that romantic love has two stages (and how to make the transition), that mutual sexual fulfillment is not automatic, and that personality profoundly affects behavior. The stakes on marriage are high, but the rewards of preparing are even higher. Whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re single or dating, this audio can be your relationship blueprint and help you decide if and when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ready to tie the knot. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re engaged, even recently married, it will help you examine your relationship foundation and learn the skills necessary for building a successful marriage. Things I Wish IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Known Before We Got Married was written to help you realize your goal of marital happiness. But donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just listen to itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½experience it. Grapple with the practical tips and ideas discussed, honestly share your thoughts and feelings, respect each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opinions, and find workable solutions to your differences. The more you do so, says Chapman, the more you will be prepared for marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510EyYH-pSL._SS400_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510EyYH-pSL._SS400_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iLsZ4vXvL._SS400_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iLsZ4vXvL._SS400_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[.........................ENJOY...............................]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bfb69ba0bbf8f2c4735aa5215b483a193b78e5","amp;dn":"Things+I+Wish+I%5C%27d+Known+Before+We+Got+Married-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bfb69ba0bbf8f2c4735aa5215b483a193b78e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,182,155,160,187,248,242,196,115,90,165,33,91,72,58,25,59,120,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
