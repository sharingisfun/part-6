Phones. Tablets. TVs and set-top boxes powered by\nGoogle TV. Soon, Android will be in cars and all sort of other places as well.\nHowever, the general theme of Android devices will be smaller screens\nand/or no hardware keyboard. And, by the numbers, Android will probably\nbe most associated with smartphones for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhen you write a desktop application, you are &quot;master of your own\ndomain&quot;. You launch your main window and any child windows Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like\ndialog boxes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that are needed. From your standpoint, you are your own\nworld, leveraging features supported by the operating system, but largely\nignorant of any other program that may be running on the computer at the\nsame time. If you do interact with other programs, it is typically through an\nAPI, such as using JDBC (or frameworks atop it) to communicate with\nMySQL or another database.\nAndroid has similar concepts, but packaged differently, and structured to\nmake phones more crash-resistant.\n\nThanks for your interest in developing applications for Android!\nIncreasingly, people will access Internet-based services using so-called\n&quot;non-traditional&quot; means, such as mobile devices. The more we do in that\nspace now, the more that people will help invest in that space to make it\neasier to build more powerful mobile applications in the future. Android is\nnew Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Android-powered devices appeared on the scene first in late 2008 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\nbut it likely will rapidly grow in importance due to the size and scope of the\nOpen Handset Alliance.\nAnd, most of all, thanks for your interest in this book! I sincerely hope you\nfind it useful and at least occasionally entertaining.\n\nHere is what's coming in the rest of this book:\nThe next two chapters are designed to get you going quickly with the\nAndroid environment, through a series of step-by-step, tutorial-style\ninstructions for setting up the tools you need, creating your first project,\nand getting that first project running on the Android emulator.\nThe three chapters that follow try to explain a bit more about what just\nhappened in those first two chapters. We examine the Android project that\nwe created, talk a bit more about Eclipse, and discuss some things we could\nadd to the project to help it run on more devices and such.\nThe bulk of the book is exploring various capabilities of the Android APIs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\nhow to create components like activities, how to access the Internet and\nlocal databases, how to get your location and show it on a map, and so\nforth.\n\nBook Details :\n\nTitle : Android_Development programming { UPPOG2 } torrents\nPages : 731\nSize : 9.8 Mb\nLanguage : English\nFormat : pdf\n\nfollow us on facebook...\n\nhttp:// www. facebook. com/ torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a77c14ae93c61e81e4c1308780f8af55889d799","amp;dn":"Android_Development+programming+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a77c14ae93c61e81e4c1308780f8af55889d799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,119,193,74,233,60,97,232,30,76,19,8,120,15,138,245,88,137,215,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
