The Ã¢â‚¬Å“pureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ insurance risk component of these investments can range from that of property catastrophe to longevity, all of which provide limited correlation with the investment performance of traditional asset types.\n\nSecuritisation of insurance risk has also become an important tool for risk and capital management that can be utilised by insurance companies alongside the more traditional approaches. It offers insurance and reinsurance companies additional flexibility at a time when the landscape keeps changing and the ability to respond to changes quickly is a critical source of competitive advantage.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART I: INTRODUCTION TO INVESTING IN INSURANCE RISK\n\n1 Investing in Insurance Risk\n\nInvesting in risk\n\nInsurance risk\n\nInsurance markets\n\nSecurities issued
