An introduction that will give you the tools to create an application easily, making use of good practices.\n\nOnce you have joined the course I will answer your questions about the contents.\n\n(more)\nCategory: Technology\nWhat are the requirements?\nWhat am I going to get from this cou\n\nYear : 2013\nManufacturer : udemy.com \nAuthor : David Morales \nDuration : 3h 36min\nFormat : MP4 \nVideo : MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.976fps 456kbps \nAudio : AAC 48000Hz stereo 33kbps \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-web-development-with-symfony2/?sl=E0F0dDFUKitDGk9j&amp;dtcode=s3y276yu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-web-development-with-symfony2/?sl=E0F0dDFUKitDGk9j&amp;dtcode=s3y276yu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8123b9e96aa69255a897962cb883743ca876f019","amp;dn":"udemy+-+Introduction+to+web+development+with+Symfony2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8123b9e96aa69255a897962cb883743ca876f019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,35,185,233,106,166,146,85,168,151,150,44,184,131,116,60,168,118,240,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
