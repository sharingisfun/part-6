Taking place in the futuristic world of Planet Spaceball, and with all of the movie's original characters returning including President Skroob and Yogurt (both voiced by Brooks), the show will satirize such household names as 'The Lord of the Rings,' 'Spider Man,' 'The Terminator,' 'The Pirates of the Caribbean,' and 'American Idol,' parodying these mega-hits with light-hearted political and social satire as well as slapstick comedy.
