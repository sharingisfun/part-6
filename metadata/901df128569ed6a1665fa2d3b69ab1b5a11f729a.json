This innovative weapon inspired the Soviet AK-47 in 7.62x39mm calibre. In the West, the NATO countries looked hard at new weapons to upgrade their own infantry arsenals and counter the AK-47, resulting in the design of the Fusil Automatique LÃƒÂ©ger or FAL. It proved to be a successful battle rifle and was soon adopted by the military and police forces of no fewer than 93 nations. The FAL dominated the militaries of the West to such a degree that its nickname became the Right Arm of the Free World. The FAL fulfilled every role it was asked to perform and remains a viable and well-respected weapon to this day.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-FAL-Battle-Rifle-Weapon/dp/1780969031&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-FAL-Battle-Rifle-Weapon/dp/1780969031&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:901df128569ed6a1665fa2d3b69ab1b5a11f729a","amp;dn":"The+FN+FAL+Battle+Rifle+%28Osprey+Weapon+27%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"901df128569ed6a1665fa2d3b69ab1b5a11f729a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,29,241,40,86,158,214,161,102,95,162,211,182,154,177,181,161,31,114,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
