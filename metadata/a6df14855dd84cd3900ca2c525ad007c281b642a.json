Salman Rushdie and Deepa Mehta, two names famous in Indian culture, bring us this lavish feast. Midnight refers to the moment of India's independence, also known as partition - Mehta deals with this in Earth (1998). Midnight's Children is set in a later age, as two people born at &quot;midnight&quot; struggle to find their place in a changing world. I don't want to spoil your enjoyment, so I won't say any more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6df14855dd84cd3900ca2c525ad007c281b642a","amp;dn":"Midnight%27s+Children+%282012%29+Deepa+Mehta+Salman+Rushdie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6df14855dd84cd3900ca2c525ad007c281b642a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,223,20,133,93,216,76,211,144,12,162,197,37,173,0,124,40,27,100,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
