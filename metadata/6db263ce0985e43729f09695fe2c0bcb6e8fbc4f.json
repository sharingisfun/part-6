This convenient book provides 300 exercises, with instructive points highlighted in the solutions.\n\nThere is something here for everyone. The puzzles in the first two chapters are based on a clear-cut tactic or checkmate, such as those explained in Gambit's best-sellers How to Beat Your Dad at Chess and Chess Tactics for Kids. The endgame challenges highlight tactics and principles in action. In practice it is vital to defend resiliently and seek counterattacking chances - there is an innovative chapter on these rarely-covered themes as well as puzzles where the reader must decide how to punch home an attack.\n\nLater chapters help readers develop a vital skill: the ability to make tough chessboard decisions. Attack, sacrifice, grab material, defend or simplify - it's for you to decide! Principles and guidelines are emphasized, together with common sources of error. The final section of puzzles will prove a stern challenge even for the best players, with the reader exposed to the full complexity of modern chess - with a few helpful hints along the way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gambit-Book-Instructive-Chess-Puzzles/dp/1906454280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326905537&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gambit-Book-Instructive-Chess-Puzzles/dp/1906454280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326905537&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db263ce0985e43729f09695fe2c0bcb6e8fbc4f","amp;dn":"The+Gambit+Book+of+Instructive+Chess+Puzzles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db263ce0985e43729f09695fe2c0bcb6e8fbc4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,178,99,206,9,133,228,55,41,240,150,149,254,44,11,203,110,143,188,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
