The book is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs.\n\nThe Penguin Classic and Norton Critical editions included here are improved versions of older scans, with the page images completely reprocessed and contents in bookmarks and accurate pagination.  The Cambridge edition edited by Logan and Adams is not of the same quality but still perfectly legible for study purposes.\n\n\nAll three translations are in PDF format:\n\n* UTOPIA: A Revised Translation / Backgrounds / Criticism (Norton Critical Edition, 1991).  Second edition.  Translated and edited by Robert M. Adams.\n\n* UTOPIA (Cambridge UP, 2002).  Revised edition.  Edited by George M. Logan and Robert M. Adams.\n\n* UTOPIA (Penguin Classics, 2003).  Translated with an Introduction and Notes by Paul Turner.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
