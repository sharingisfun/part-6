It plays out like a best-of episode of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, a chorus that is both catchy yet shows Ace EndersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ voice in apoplectic yelling, marching guitars that can hypnotize a crowd to existentially jump while drenched in sweat, and the purposeful quiet the band is known for. The song progresses and EndersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lyrics become much more dangerous while the music builds, its guitar section becoming more intense. In their world, at a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice anything can fade away, feelings can become immediately alien as time ticks forward. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the story of Imbue, the testament of a band who has shaken off the Ã¢â‚¬Å“newnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of being reunited, to going back to making records with the energy they had when they were 20 years old","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2132064d3e8216aeefd3711654a79c40411c710a","amp;dn":"The+Early+November+-+Imbue+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2132064d3e8216aeefd3711654a79c40411c710a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,50,6,77,62,130,22,174,239,211,113,22,84,167,156,64,65,28,113,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
