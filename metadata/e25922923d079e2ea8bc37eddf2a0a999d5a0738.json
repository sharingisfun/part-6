It mixes coloristic electrophonics with impressionistic orchestra-like sound.\n\nThe use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal sounding instruments, as well as an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound. Their epic soundscapes manipulated through sound effects and catalystic sonic experimentations have a semi-classical feel to them. Entheogenic also records and uses a large amount of &quot;natural samples&quot; - water, human voices, animals, etc.\n\nEntheogenic was formed in 1999 , when Helmut Glavar and Piers Oak-Rhind met while working as VIPs for Emagic and sound technicians in a recording studio in France. Helmut Glavar, born in Austria, has been a musician and songwriter since the early 1980s and founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave, and drums n bass. Piers Oak-Rhind, born in England, has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s, when he studied guitar at the London School of Guitar.
