While that record focused on vocal recitations and percussion, though, Scott-Heron's second album, Pieces Of  A Man, brought things to another level. Here Scott-Heron emerges as an affecting singer and melodist. With his musical aide-de-camp Brian Jackson, he proffers fully fleshed-out musical arrangements that encompass blues, jazz, and R&amp;B. The striking ballad &quot;Lady Day and John Coltrane&quot; makes a particularly compelling case for Scott-Heron and Jackson's jazzier inclinations. At the same time, Scott-Heron's urgent proto-rapping is still present, as is his powerful social message, most notably on the rabble-rousing &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,&quot; which would become one of his signature songs. While his first album was an unforgettable bolt from the blue, Pieces Of  A Man is where Scott-Heron truly came into his own.\n\n[size=4][color=red][b]Tracklist[/b][/color]\n1 Revolution Will Not Be Televised 5:03 \n2 Save the Children 7:02 \n3 Lady Day and John Coltrane 5:32 \n4 Home Is Where the Hatred Is 5: \n5 When You Are Who You Are 5: \n6 I Think I'll Call It Morning 5: \n7 Pieces of a Man 7:39 \n8 Sign of the Ages 6:41 \n9 Or Down You Fall 5:12 \n10 Needle's Eye 7: \n11 Prisoner 15:25\n\nRecorded on April 19 &amp; 20, 1971.\n\n\nPersonnel: Gil Scott-Heron (vocals); Johnny Pale (conductor); Hubert Laws (saxophone, flute); Brian Jackson (acoustic &amp; electric pianos); Burt Jones (electric guitar); Ron Carter (acoustic &amp; electric basses); Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a12974817c32b514e2339ba1494cad686733ac","amp;dn":"Gil+Scott-Heron+Pieces+Of+A+Man+%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a12974817c32b514e2339ba1494cad686733ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,161,41,116,129,124,50,181,20,226,51,155,161,73,76,173,104,103,51,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
