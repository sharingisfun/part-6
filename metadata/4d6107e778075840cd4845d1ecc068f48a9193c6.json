It is the official sequel to the wildly popular and immensely successful personal impact simulator - Stair Dismount.\nThe highlights of this experience are multiple vehicles, an awesome replay system, level editing features, high-speed physics and an indiscriminate sense of style.\nThe purpose of the game is simple - damage awards points. It is up to you to try different combinations of obstacles, vehicles, poses and levels to make it to the top of the leaderboards. To support friendly rivalry, Turbo Dismount supports placing a photo of your friend on the face of Mr. Dismount - such a delightful way to express one's emotions! \n\nChangelog:\nv1.5 (27.11.2014):\n- Seasonal turkey mode (in character selection screen)!\n- New level: &quot;Swiss banks&quot;\n- Minor performance tweaks \nv1.4 (30.10.2014):\n- New character: Mr. Ego, the brains of the operation, with heavy thoughts!\n- Seasonal pumpkin mode included (in character selection screen)!\n- Four new levels! &quot;Fast Lane&quot;, &quot;Missing Delivery&quot;, &quot;Split Decision&quot; and &quot;Monorail Incident&quot;\n- Added Support and Twitter buttons to main menu (follow us on Twitter!)\n- Minor visual and performance tweaks \nv1.3 (02.10.2014):\n- Move &amp; Rotate obstacle hotspots in the setup screen (this should be interesting!)\n- More music, the game's now doing double the disco!\n- Manual disabling of controller support\n- Updating Subscription levels improved (this we'd like feedback on)\n- Visual indicators for Stalled / Go / Full Speed\n- Two-wheelers now way better! It's like they no longer have training wheels!\n- New obstacle: Brake Pad (the anti-turbo-pad)\n- Editor asset package updated with Brake Pad\n- Improved icon! Yeay! \n\nFor the full changelog, see changelog.txt.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://turbodismount.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://turbodismount.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/263760/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/263760/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6107e778075840cd4845d1ecc068f48a9193c6","amp;dn":"Turbo+Dismount+v1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6107e778075840cd4845d1ecc068f48a9193c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,97,7,231,120,7,88,64,205,72,69,209,236,192,104,244,138,145,147,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
