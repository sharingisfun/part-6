The following\n.  provides an overview of the core tools.\n:\nXML Schema Editor\nA graphical XSD editor, allowing you to visualize and edit\nyour schemas. The editor provides an abstracted view of the\nXSD making it simple to understand your data. Context\nsensitive properties make using the more advanced features\nof the XSD standard simple, while drag and drop, cut &amp;\npaste, and multi step undo functionality makes editing your\nschema simple and intuitive.\n\nXML Data Binding Code Generator\n'XML Data Binding' involves the creation of a class library\nfrom an XML schema (XSD). Liquid XML Data Binder uses its\ncode generator engine to generate a class libraries\nspecifically for use with your XML data allowing XML\ndocuments to be manipulated programmatically, in a simple,\nintuitive way. This allows you to deal with strongly typed,\nnamed, properties and classes instead of generic XML nodes,\nreducing the amount of coding needed, increasing\nproductivity and reliability, and reducing development\ncosts.\n\nLiquid XML Data Binder is the most comprehensive XML Data\nBinding Code Generator tool available. With Support for all\nmajor development languages, hardware environments, and\nschema standards.\n\nUsing Liquid XML within your software development project\nwill radically simplify your interaction with XML\ndocuments, increasing reliability, reducing development\ntime, and testing effort. Simply put it bridges the gap\nbetween your development language (C, C#, Java, VB6,\nVb.Net) and XML. Once you try it you'll never go back to a\nbasic DOM or SAX parser.\n\nWSDL Editor\nThe WSDL editor abstracts much of the complexity of the\nWSDL standard, presenting the structure of the WSDL without\nshowing the unnecessary complexity. This provides a view\nthat makes understanding and editing the your WSDL document\nsimple. Access to the full range of related facets is\navailible via the properties window and the WSDL can be\nedited directly within the Source view.\n\nXML Editor\nA graphical XML Editor to allow intuitive editing of xml\ndata in a tree and tabular grid. Syntax highlighted XML\nEditor, providing validation against the XML standard or an\nXSD schema. Auto complete, and intellisense are based on an\nexternal XML Schema. XSD Schemas can also be inferred from\nan existing XML document.\n\nAnd much more...\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n\nInstall the Application\nUnpack contents of patch.zip to installed directory,\noverwriting all files (Win7 &amp; Vista Users, do this as\nAdministrator)\nEnter anything as license key\nOn activation screen, choose 'Activate Manually'\nGenerate Activation Response in Keygen\n\nNote: You might want to disable your internet connection to\nprevent the app from calling home during activation process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3acb975c4617554b15cbec26bb0548ab102a3fad","amp;dn":"Liquid.XML.Studio.2011.v9.0.11.3078.Incl.Keymaker.and.Patch-EMBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3acb975c4617554b15cbec26bb0548ab102a3fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,203,151,92,70,23,85,75,21,203,236,38,187,5,72,171,16,42,63,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
