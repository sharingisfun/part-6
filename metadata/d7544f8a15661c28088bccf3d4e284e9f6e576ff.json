Due to his disputes with 50 Cent, Game left Aftermath/G-Unit and signed with Geffen Records another label under Universal Music Group's Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M division to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in the summer of 2006.\n\nDespite the absence of Dr. Dre, who executive produced Game's debut record, The Documentary, the album featured production by four other returning producersÃ¢â‚¬â€Kanye West, Just Blaze, Scott Storch and Hi-TekÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as will.i.am and Swizz Beatz. Production for the album was also contributed by DJ Khalil, Jellyroll, Jonathan &quot;J.R.&quot; Rotem, Mr. Porter, Nottz, Reefa, Ervin &quot;E.P.&quot; Pope and D-Roc, among others.\n\nDoctor's Advocate debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling over 358,000 copies in its first week, making it Game's second number one album in a row.[1][2] According to The Game himself and Geffen Records, the album has sold nearly 3,000,000 copies worldwide.\n\nGuests featured on Doctor's Advocate include Busta Rhymes, Kanye West, Nas, Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit. Upon its release, the album received favorable reviews, with music critics praising the album's production. Game made a point to prove that he could still make good music and be a successful artist, as he did on The Documentary, without the help from Dr. Dre or 50 Cent.[3][4] As with The Documentary, Doctor's Advocate was distributed in the United Kingdom by Polydor Records, which is the British distributor for Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M releases. Game called Doctor's Advocate the best album of his career.[5]\n\nBitrate: 320kbps)\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1. Lookin' At You\n2. Da Shit\n3. It's Okay (One Blood)\n4. Compton (feat. will.i.am)\n5.
