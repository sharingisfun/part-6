It is also the source for the film of the same name directed by David Cronenberg, the first cinematic adaption of a work by John Wagner since 1995's Judge Dredd. The story concerns a small town Michigan cafe owner, Tom McKenna, who becomes a local hero after defending his store from an attempted robbery. When his story receives national attention, several members of the New York City Mafia arrive in town, believing him to be someone named Joey, who crossed them 20 years earlier. Whilst Tom protests his innocence to everyone, eventually his facade is dropped and he is forced to reveal his history of violence to his wife and son.\n\nENJOY AND SEED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7498f286c43fce1d6fb42ca53e7676e488a274cb","amp;dn":"A+HISTORY+OF+VIOLENCE+%28requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7498f286c43fce1d6fb42ca53e7676e488a274cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,152,242,134,196,63,206,29,111,180,44,165,62,118,118,228,136,162,116,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
