Cash is a genuine titan of popular music, whose finest work should be as venerated as anything by Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, David Bowie or Brian Wilson, and this collection does as good a job of beginning to explain why as any. The virtue of Cash's music is its simplicity. His brutally reductive take on country, set to his distinctive boom-chicka-boom backbeat, directs all of the listener's attention to his supernaturally world-weary voice (even as a teenager, Cash sounded about a thousand years old). This collection is a judicious mix of covers (Hank Williams' &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, Bob Dylan's &quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot; among them) and original Cash standards. That the producers of this record have a genuine empathy with their subject is confirmed by their inclusion of a live version of the triumphantly nihilist &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; (once identified by Ice-T, no less, as a progenitor of gangsta rap) taped at one of Cash's famous prison concerts . The cheers that greet the line &quot;I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die&quot; are the eeriest confirmation of credibility by an audience upon a performer ever recorded.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Ring Of Fire\n[02] I Walk The Line\n[03] A Thing Called Love\n[04] Sunday Morning Coming Down\n[05] Folsom Prison Blues\n[06] Home Of The Blues\n[07] Guess Things Happen That Way\n[08] The Way Of A Woman In Love\n[09] Ballad Of Ira Hayes\n[10] Tennessee Flat Top Box\n[11] I Got Stripes\n[12] Get Rhythm\n[13] Cry, Cry, Cry\n[14] Hey Porter\n[15] Ballad Of A Teenage Queen\n[16] Five Feet High And Rising\n[17] Long Black Veil\n[18] I Still Miss Someone\n[19] Blue Train\n[20] (There'll Be) Peace In The Valley (For Me)\n[21] The Night Hank Williams Came To Town\n[22] Family Bible\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:59m:22s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 143mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.6.1.9 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Country\n\nOriginal CD Ripper  \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 06 April 1998\n\nRecords Company    \t- Spectrum Music\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.johnnycash.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.johnnycashonline.com/  \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cea13ffe333b4f2b478416f520abdf73f549367b","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+The+Best+Of+-+Johnny+Cash+-+143mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cea13ffe333b4f2b478416f520abdf73f549367b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,161,63,254,51,59,79,43,71,132,22,245,32,171,223,115,245,73,54,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
