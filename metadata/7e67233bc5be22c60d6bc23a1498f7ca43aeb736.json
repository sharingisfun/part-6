Drawing Down the Moon\n\nReview _\n\n\nMuch of Young MagicÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs debut full-length, Melt, plants itself in a nebulous, pan-ethnic sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become something of an indie sub-subgenre unto itself this past half-decade, demonstrated to varying degrees by bands such as Animal Collective and All Hour Cymbals-era Yeasayer. World rhythms, chanting, 1960Ã¢â‚¬Â²s pop harmonies, unabashedly psychedelic washes of synth, Middle Eastern tones, an empty parking garageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of echo; you know the drill by now. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not bad music, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even close to that, by any means. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just exploring territory thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become very well-trodden over the last few years.\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be fair to clump them in with a bunch of also-rans, either: Young Magic are incredibly well-traveled and more likely to be influenced by the actual world at large than just by their Brooklyn peers. The album itself contains recordings made in a whopping 10 different countries. Last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single Ã¢â‚¬Å“SparklyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features some ethereal, windswept vocals overtop a tribal beat. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slip TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a fun, plodding, drunken groove, while the washed-out vibe and warbly synths of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Night in the OceanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stick out on the album as something quite different from the rest of the tracks, as if it were plucked from another chillwave record. In fact, Melt sometimes feels like a well-made mixtape with tracks culled from your favorite indie records of 2009.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard not to get a Ã¢â‚¬Å“been here before, done thatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feeling when listening to much of the record. Had this come out four years ago, it probably would have bowled us over with its innovation. As it stands today, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just another band doing a very familiar thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing it really well.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e67233bc5be22c60d6bc23a1498f7ca43aeb736","amp;dn":"Young+Magic+-+Melt+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e67233bc5be22c60d6bc23a1498f7ca43aeb736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,103,35,59,197,190,34,198,13,107,194,58,20,152,247,202,67,174,183,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
