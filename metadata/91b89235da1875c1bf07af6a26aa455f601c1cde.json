He identifies a Ã¢â‚¬Å“global styleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of architectureÃ¢â‚¬â€as practiced by Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Renzo PianoÃ¢â‚¬â€analogous to the international style of Le Corbusier, Gropius and Mies.\n\nMore than any art, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global style conveys both the dreams and delusions of modernity. Foster demonstrates that a study of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“art-architecture complexÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides invaluable insight into broader social and economic trajectories in urgent need of analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b89235da1875c1bf07af6a26aa455f601c1cde","amp;dn":"The+Art-Architecture+Complex+%28Art+Ebook%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b89235da1875c1bf07af6a26aa455f601c1cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,184,146,53,218,24,117,193,191,7,175,106,38,170,69,95,96,28,28,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
