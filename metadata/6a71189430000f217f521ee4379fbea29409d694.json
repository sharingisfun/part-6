But as he investigates, the evidence points to conspiracies far stranger and more deadly than anything he could have imagined.\n\nBorlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº must travel from the decaying Beszel to the only metropolis on Earth as strange as his own. This is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a shift in perception, a seeing of the unseen. His destination is BeszelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the rich and vibrant city of Ul Qoma. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, and struggling with his own transition, BorlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of rabid nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them and those they care about more than their lives.\n\nWhat stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.\n\nCasting shades of Kafka and Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler and 1984, The City &amp; the City is a murder mystery taken to dazzling metaphysical and artistic heights.\nEnjoy and seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a71189430000f217f521ee4379fbea29409d694","amp;dn":"China+Mieville++The+City+%26amp%3B+the+City+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a71189430000f217f521ee4379fbea29409d694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,113,24,148,48,0,15,33,127,82,30,228,55,159,190,162,148,9,214,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
