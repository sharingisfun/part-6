Political and sexual intrigue abound. The primary families are the Stark, Lannister, and Baratheon families. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard Stark to serve as his chief advisor. Eddard, suspecting that his predecessor had been murdered, accepts so that he can investigate further. It turns out more than one family is plotting to take the throne. The Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching an incestuous plot to take control. Across the sea, the last surviving members of the previously deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also plotting a return to power. The conflict between these families and others, including the Greyjoys, the Tullys, the Arryns, and the Tyrells, leads to war. Meanwhile, in the north, an ancient evil awakens. Amidst war and the political confusion, a brotherhood of misfits, The Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and the horrors beyond.\n\n\nEpisode 01 - Winter is Coming ---------- Air Date: 17 Apr 2011\nEpisode 02 - The Kingsroad ------------- Air Date: 24 Apr 2011\nEpisode 03 - Lord Snow ----------------- Air Date: 01 May 2011\nEpisode 04 - Cripples Bastards and Brok- Air Date: 08 May 2011\nEpisode 05 - The Wolf and the Lion ----- Air Date: 15 May 2011\nEpisode 06 - A Golden Crown ------------ Air Date: 22 May 2011\nEpisode 07 - You Win or You Die -------- Air Date: 29 May 2011\nEpisode 08 - The Pointy End ------------ Air Date: 05 Jun 2011\nEpisode 09 - Baelor -------------------- Air Date: 12 Jun 2011\nEpisode 10 - Fire and Blood ------------ Air Date: 19 Jun 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08e5fc753e66027fffc8a6c4ba7bc41e701b1e8","amp;dn":"Game.of.Thrones.S01.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08e5fc753e66027fffc8a6c4ba7bc41e701b1e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,142,95,199,83,230,96,39,255,252,138,108,75,167,188,65,231,1,177,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
