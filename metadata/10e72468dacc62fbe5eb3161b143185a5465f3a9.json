The film explores women's under-representation in positions of power by challenging their limited and often disparaging portrayals in the media.  Miss Representation takes the stand that the media is portraying women's primary values as their youth, beauty and sexuality - rather than their capacity as leaders.  The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was the winner of the 2011 Maui Film Festival Movie Matters Award.  Miss Representation is written, directed and produced by Jennifer Siebel Newsom.
