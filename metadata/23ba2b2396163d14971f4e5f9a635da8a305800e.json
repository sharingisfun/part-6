Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by a man sent to assassinate Richard. With the pilot dead, the plane crashes.\n\nIn the present, Richard and Mary's son, Peter, fights crime as Spider-Man. He apprehends Aleksei Sytsevich, who attempted to steal a truck containing plutonium vials, and rescues OsCorp employee Max Dillon. While speaking by phone with Gwen Stacy, Peter sees a vision of her deceased father, police captain George Stacy, reminding him to leave Gwen out of his affairs as Spider-Man. After their high school graduation, Peter meets with Gwen at a restaurant outside, insisting he needs to keep his vow to her father by staying away from her, and the two break up.\n\nPeter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally ill father, Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is hereditary and Harry is at the age where it first develops. He gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO. He accuses the OsCorp board of trying to wrest control from the Osborns, as they have been privy to Norman's secret biogenetic projects for foreign military powers.\n\nThinking they have become best friends, Max idolizes Spider-Man. While tending to maintenance in an OsCorp laboratory, he gets electrocuted and falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels. They mutate him into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but, as she reveals that an opportunity for a scholarship at Oxford University means that she may move to Britain, Max wanders into Times Square and accidentally causes a blackout. Spider-Man attempts to calm him down, but the police fire at Max, and Spider-Man's resulting rescue of the endangered citizens draws media attention away from Max, making him lose his temper and attack. Spider-Man eventually stops him, and Max is taken to Ravencroft Institute.\n\nHarry's illness begins to show, and he deduces Spider-Man's blood will save him, later asking Peter to find Spider-Man. Peter attempts to dissuade him, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have, and, although he does come to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses; Harry begins to hate Spider-Man. The OsCorp board members frame Harry for covering up Max's accident, and remove him as CEO. Harry's assistant informs him of equipment that could help him; he works with Max to get him back inside the OsCorp building and, there, finds a suit of armor made by Norman, and venom from genetically altered spiders. The venom accelerates his illness and transforms him into a goblin-like creature, but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health.\n\nPeter uses information left by his father to find a video message in a hidden lab; Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's biogenetic weaponization plans. Peter gets a voicemail from Gwen, telling him she got the scholarship at Oxford and is leaving for Britain earlier than expected. Before she leaves, he catches her and professes his love. When Max causes another blackout, Peter and Gwen go to confront him. They restore power and overload Max's body, killing him. Harry arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry; he deduces Spider-Man's true identity and kidnaps Gwen. He fights Spider-Man at the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man subdues Harry, but despite his attempts to save Gwen, she falls to her death. A distraught Peter gives up being Spider-Man and he spends several days throughout the year at Gwen's grave.\n\nFive months later, Harry has healed from his transformation at Ravencroft. His associate Gustav Fiers visits him and breaks Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with a mechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the &quot;Rhino&quot; and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, returns to battle him as Spider-Man.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23ba2b2396163d14971f4e5f9a635da8a305800e","amp;dn":"+The+Amazing+Spider-Man+2+%282014%29+-+English+HD+Bluray+Rip+X264+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23ba2b2396163d14971f4e5f9a635da8a305800e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,186,43,35,150,22,61,20,151,31,78,95,154,99,93,168,163,5,128,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
