It&amp;#039;s difficult to watch(god, that &quot;cinematography&quot;!) but footage of the Velvets is so scarce that any true fan will gladly watch this film time and time again. After all, where else can you see Lou, John, Sterling, and Moe in their black leather and sunglasses? (They didn&amp;#039;t look like this in the 1993 reunion film!) The music sounds similar to the instrumental sections of &amp;#039;Run Run Run&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;European Son(To Delmore Schwartz)&amp;#039; on the band&amp;#039;s first album. There are no vocals. Listen to the first two records by the Velvets--&quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;--and you&amp;#039;ll be able to appreciate the film much more keenly.\n\n\njust recently saw a film print of this for the first time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&amp;#039;s Warhol retrospective a few weeks ago and was floored. If you are an artist or a musician, or both, then this is a particularly important film to see. It exists as the perfect time-capsule of 1966 in the Warhol Factory and completely lacks pretension. Even though it&amp;#039;s original intention was to be wall paper (un-edited, moving images of The Velvet Underground, projected onto themselves as they actually played live), it still managed to take me though just about my entire range of emotions. Throughout the course of the film I thought about life, death, art, love, sex, and nearly everything in between. If you are expecting a concert film, think again...\nIf you are lucky enough to find it, watch it with an open mind.\n\n\nEven ardent fans of the velvet underground will probably move uneasily in their chairs during this picture. The movie includes everything, except for a VU performance. The band IS there, and they are playing, but it is an incoherent jam session from hell rather then something familiar. Warhol accompanies the music with repeating focus shifts, lighting experiments, bizarre camera movements, etc., all of which combined create an hypnotic trance-like effect, not to be forgotten soon. Warhol also chooses to let only the diegtic sound from the amplifiers be heard, and thus whole sequences, such as the cops who arrive to stop the show on account of various complaints from neighbors, remain unheard and eluded to instead of crudely &quot;shown&quot;. This is a revolutionary experiment in rock videos, even in today&amp;#039;s standards.\n\nThanks to anybody for the rip\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
