Because of this the mkv is sligthly &quot;undersized&quot;\n\nWhy doesn't everything get released as BD5?\n\n&gt; We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other\ngroups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing\nincompatible BluRay releases. It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in\nDVD Players\n\nThese types of releases are also meant to replace BluRay releases in archives\n\nDOWN is back with high quality bluray rips - watch out for more to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cc0c200256ec5390835c0f4fba8d4b690334a3","amp;dn":"Immortal.Beloved.1994.1080p.BluRay.x264-DOWN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cc0c200256ec5390835c0f4fba8d4b690334a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,204,12,32,2,86,236,83,144,131,92,15,79,186,141,75,105,3,52,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
