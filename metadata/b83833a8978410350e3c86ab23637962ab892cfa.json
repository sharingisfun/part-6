Organized by disorder, this book is the only one to provide a sample report for each of the major communicative disorders discussed. It also includes a chapter devoted to basic report writing skills and grammar. The assessment aspects of the book offer an in-depth chapter on counseling, a detailed and comprehensive chapter on dysphasia for both pediatric and adult populations, and a clear and practical chapter on assessment of accent. Each chapter is written by experts in their area of communication disorders and provides the following information: background and characteristics of the disorder; parameters for assessment; pertinent interview questions; an inventory and explanation of relevant formal and informal assessment measures in narrative and table format; a section on differential diagnosis to assist in teasing out the specific problem; and a sample case history with assessment tools chosen for that vignette along with rationale for making such selections. All this information is woven into a sample diagnostic report and a similar assignment is provided for practice, making this an ideal resource for ESL learners as well as students preparing for the praxis. Every chapter includes a list of key vocabulary and a glossary to familiarize your students with the professional vernacular relevant for writing diagnostic reports.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83833a8978410350e3c86ab23637962ab892cfa","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+Clinical+Assessment++in+Speech+Language+Pathology%2C+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83833a8978410350e3c86ab23637962ab892cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,56,51,168,151,132,16,53,14,60,134,171,35,99,121,98,171,137,44,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
