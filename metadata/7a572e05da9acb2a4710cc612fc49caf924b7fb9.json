They live in an isolated cabin, somehow subsisting on cornmeal and other low-grade fare. Rinthy goes into labor. Culla, ashamed of their incest, refuses to fetch a midwife, and instead leaves Rinthy to give birth by herself. He cuts the umbilical chord, and, unbeknownst to his unconscious sister, carries the baby into the woods, and leaves it there to die. The baby, however, is discovered by a wandering tinker. Rinthy eventually regains her strength and wants to know what became of their child.
