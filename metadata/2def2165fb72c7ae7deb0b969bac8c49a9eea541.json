Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 25 years. She is ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the richest women in entertainment. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame.\n\nAfter signing a recording contract with A&amp;M in 1982, she came to prominence following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover appeal in popular music. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.\n\nIn 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, Billboard named her the second most successful recording artist of the decade, following Mariah Carey. She has amassed an extensive catalog of hits, with singles such as &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, &quot;That's the Way Love Goes&quot;, &quot;Together Again&quot;, and &quot;All for You&quot; her most iconic.\n\nHaving sold over 100 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music.[1] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums.[2] In 2008, Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, ranking her at number seven. In 2010, the magazine announced the &quot;Top 50 R&amp;B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years&quot;, ranking her at number five. One of the world's most awarded artists, her longevity, records and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and redefining the scope of popular music. She has been cited as an inspiration among numerous performers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber Ones 2009\n\n\nNumber Ones (released internationally as The Best) is the second greatest hits compilation by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on November 17, 2009 by Universal Music Enterprises (UMe).[1] The double-disc album is composed of 33 of her number one hit singles spanning various music charts across North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Africa.\n\nNumber Ones collects singles from her third studio album Control (1986) to her tenth studio album Discipline (2008), and was made possible as a joint venture between UMe and EMI Music. The album's single, &quot;Make Me&quot;, was made available for digital download on September 22, 2009. On December 22, Make Me became her nineteenth number one hit single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart\n\nFollowing her performance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Make Me&quot; was released on Jackson's official website as an audio stream for those who joined the site's e-mail newsletter.[3] On September 22, 2009 it was released as a digital download for purchase. Although claims were made that &quot;Make Me&quot; is a tribute song to her late brother, Michael Jackson's 1979 single &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;, Jackson later stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest it is not, despite the similarity of the lyrics in the song's outro.[4] In October 2009, UMe issued a press release stating &quot;Make Me&quot; would be included in Jackson's second greatest hits album, comprising 33 of her global number one singles. The two-disc set spans chart-topping singles from Control (1986) to Discipline (2008) across the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Dance Club Songs, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and international charts such as Oricon and the South African Singles Chart.[5]\n\nTo celebrate the release of Number Ones, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Flash Mob America organized three fan gatherings on November 14, 2009 in Los Angeles.[6][7] Kyle Anderson of MTV reported fans' gatherings in various Los Angeles locations &quot;to dance and pay tribute to some of the veteran diva's best dance moves and songs.&quot;[8] Jackson made an appearance at the gathering which took place at The Grove at Farmers Market.[8] ABC's &quot;In the Spotlight&quot; with Robin Roberts profiled Janet Jackson in a one-hour interview special that aired November 18, 2009. Good Morning America aired a preview of the interview on that same day. ABC touted a special eight-minute performance by Janet on the 37th Annual American Music Awards, which aired November 22. On the telecast, Janet performed a medley that included five past hits, in addition to &quot;Make Me.&quot;\n\nTo further promote the album, Jackson will embark on her biggest world tour entitled, Number Ones: Up Close and Personal\n\nThe compilation sold 40,374 copies (80,748 units) in the first week in the USA, debuting at number 22 on the Billboard 200,[10] and has since sold 172,000 (344,000 units) in the U.S.[11] &quot;Make Me&quot; became Jackson's 19th number one Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\n\n\nSal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the album four-and-a-half stars, commenting &quot;the songs on Janet Jackson's first-ever comprehensive hits collection, Number Ones, have been sequenced in chronological order only magnifies the impact she had on late-'80s and early-'90s pop, when she helped define the sound of Top 40 radio along with the likes of Madonna, Prince, and her brother Michael.[15] He also comments on the commercial decline of her recent work, stating &quot;but just as Number Ones's sequencing highlights Janet's impressive early years, it also underscores her startlingly abrupt decline...and the &quot;hits&quot; from her last three albums are a mere footnote here.&quot;[15] Andy Kellman of Allmusic remarked: &quot;Say what you want about Janet peaking with Jam &amp; Lewis during the latter half of the '80sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be fair, the argument is validÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but she did rack up a career's worth of solid hits during the years that followed. Even if they were not as sonically innovative and lacked the same amount of pop appeal of the Control/Rhythm Nation-era singles, they clearly made a significant impact and have aged well.&quot;[13] Val Christopher with RockStar Weekly commented saying &quot;A look back at JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s storied career provides more than ample reason for her being one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most recognizable people. Number Ones opens with a string of JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best and most memorable tracks.
