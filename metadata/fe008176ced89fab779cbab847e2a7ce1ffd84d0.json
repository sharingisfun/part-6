But it was overlooked completely in England and barely got out in America (with a big push by Al Kooper, who was then a Columbia Records producer); and it was neglected in the U.S. until the single &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; culled from the album, topped the charts nearly two years after it was recorded, by which time the group was long disbanded. Ironically, at the time of its recording in the summer of 1967, permanency was not much on the minds of the bandmembers. Odessey and Oracle was intended as a final statement, a bold last hurrah, having worked hard for three years only to see the quality of their gigs decline as the hits stopped coming. The results are consistently pleasing, surprising, and challenging: &quot;Hung Up on a Dream&quot; and &quot;Changes&quot; are some of the most powerful psychedelic pop/rock ever heard out of England, with a solid rhythm section, a hot Mellotron sound, and chiming, hard guitar, as well as highly melodic piano. &quot;Changes&quot; also benefits from radiant singing. &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; makes use of trumpets (one of the very few instances of real overdubbing) in a manner reminiscent of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;; and then there's &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; the most well-known song in their output and a white soul classic. Not all of the album is that inspired, but it's all consistently interesting and very good listening, and superior to most other psychedelic albums this side of the Beatles' best and Pink Floyd's early work. Indeed, the only complaint one might have about the original LP is its relatively short running time, barely over 30 minutes, but even that's refreshing in an era where most musicians took their time making their point, and most of the CD reissues have bonus tracks to fill out the space available. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nAll tracks recorded in Stereo, except 13 and 22-26 recorded in Mono.\n1 Care Of Cell 44\n2 A Rose For Emily\n3 Maybe After He's Gone\n4 Beechwood Park\n5 Brief Candles\n6 Hung Up On A Dream\n7 Changes\n8 I Want Her She Wants Me\n9 This Will Be Our Year\n10 Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\n11 Friends Of Mine\n12 Time Of The Season\nBonus Tracks\n13 I'll Call You Mine\n14 She Loves The Way They Love Her\n15 Imagine The Swan\n16 Smokey Day\n17 If It Don't Work Out\n18 I Know She Will\n19 Don't Cry For Me\n20 Walking In The Sun\n21 Conversation Off Floral\n22 I Want You Back Again\n23 Gotta Get A Hold Of\n24 Goin' Out Of My Head\n25 She Does Everything For Me\n26 Nothing's Changed\n27 I Could Spend The Day\n28 Girl Help Me ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe008176ced89fab779cbab847e2a7ce1ffd84d0","amp;dn":"The+Zombies+-+Odessey+%26amp%3B+Oracle+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe008176ced89fab779cbab847e2a7ce1ffd84d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,0,129,118,206,216,159,171,119,156,186,184,71,226,167,206,31,253,132,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
