Though some experts make it seem complicated, it is actually breathtakingly simple. According to Deutschman, most leaders focus too much on what they say and not nearly enough on setting an example.\n\nThis book shows what happens in those unusual cases of true leaders-in business, education, the military, and nonprofits-who always walked the walk, especially when times got tough. In a skeptical world, their actions gave them more credibility than even the best possible speeches. Consider how Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Martin Luther King Jr. was so committed to nonviolence that he let a racist detractor beat him up in front of a crowded auditorium rather than raise a hand against him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26c116813c45a61fa6cce0ee35ff675265f39cf","amp;dn":"Walk+the+Walk%3A+The+%231+Rule+for+Real+Leaders+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26c116813c45a61fa6cce0ee35ff675265f39cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,108,17,104,19,196,90,97,250,108,206,14,227,95,246,117,38,95,57,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
