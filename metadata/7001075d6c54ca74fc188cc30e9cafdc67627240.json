It generates code for IA-32, Intel 64, Itanium 2 processors. Compilers are available for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. On Windows, it is known as Intel Visual Fortran. On Linux and Mac OS X, it is known as Intel Fortran.\nIntel Fortran supports compilation for its IA-32, Intel 64 and Itanium 2 processors and certain non-Intel but compatible processors, such as certain AMD processors. Developers should check system requirements. The Intel Fortran Compiler for IA-32 and Intel 64 features an automatic vectorizer that can generate SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSE4 SIMD instructions. It supports both OpenMP3.0, automatic parallelization for symmetric multiprocessing and supports almost all of the Fortran 2003 standard. With the add-on capability Cluster OpenMP, the compiler can also automatically generate Message Passing Interface calls for distributed memory multiprocessing from OpenMP directives.\nThe Intel Fortran compiler represents the merging of the Compaq Visual Fortran frontend with the Intel backend. The compiler is also notable for being widely used for SPEC CPU Benchmarks of IA-32, x86-64, and Itanium 2 architectures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7001075d6c54ca74fc188cc30e9cafdc67627240","amp;dn":"Intel+Fortran+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7001075d6c54ca74fc188cc30e9cafdc67627240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,1,7,93,108,84,202,116,252,24,140,195,14,156,175,220,103,98,114,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
