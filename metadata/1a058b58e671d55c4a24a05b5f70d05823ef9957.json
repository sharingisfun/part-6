ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1917, and the war in Europe continues. The villagers are very proud of their Ã¢â‚¬Å“mountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and are understandably disappointed and furious to find that it is in fact a Ã¢â‚¬Å“hillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Not to be outwitted by a rule (and the Englishmen who enforce it), the villagers set out to make their hill into a mountain, but to do so they must keep the English from leaving, before the job is done.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112966/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112966/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama\niMDB Rating: 6,4/10 from 9 604 users\nDirector: Christopher Monger\nStarring: Hugh Grant, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney\n\nSource Used: The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain 1995 720p BluRay X264-AMIABLE\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/g/quCTeo1gDo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/g/quCTeo1gDo&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a058b58e671d55c4a24a05b5f70d05823ef9957","amp;dn":"The+Englishman+Who+Went+Up+a+Hill+But+Came+Down+a+Mountain+1995+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a058b58e671d55c4a24a05b5f70d05823ef9957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,5,139,88,230,113,213,92,74,36,160,91,95,112,208,88,35,239,153,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
