Having raised the alarm, Perkins passionately addresses how Americans can work to create a more peaceful and stable world for future generations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:715bac48540160486495952262e83280f839067a","amp;dn":"John+Perkins+-+Confessions+of+an+Economic+Hit+Man+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"715bac48540160486495952262e83280f839067a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,91,172,72,84,1,96,72,100,149,149,34,98,232,50,128,248,57,6,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
