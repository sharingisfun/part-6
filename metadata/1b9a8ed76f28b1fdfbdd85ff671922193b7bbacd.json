Mass unemployment due to the automation of factories? or will this lead to a leisure society and equality? Will ubiquitous drones lead to better law enforcement and less traffic congestion or to widespread crime and infringement of privacy? Should we give the go-ahead to human cloning? will climate change cause problems for our country? Are we going to run out of rare earth metals? or oil...? The people look to YOU for leadership in these turbulent times. Can you keep the country happy and prosperous as we head to the 2020s and beyond?\r\nNew Policies:\r\nHuman Cloning Research Grants\r\nDrone Strike Act\r\nElectric Cars Initiative\r\nClimate Change Adaption Fund\r\nOne Child Policy\r\nMars Program\r\nAntibiotics Ban\r\nMandatory Microchip Implant\r\nHome Fabrication Grants\r\nRare Earth Metal Mining\r\nDriverless Car Laws\r\nSynthetic Meat Research Grants\r\nInternet Currency Taxation\r\nAnti-Gravity Research Grants\r\nVertical Farm Subsidies\r\nElectronic Direct Democracy\r\nGreen Electronics Initiative\r\nInternational Fusion Research Project\r\nFarmland Acquisition Program\r\nLimit Automated Trading\r\nAutomation Tax\r\nNew Situations\r\nCyclones\r\nFood crisis\r\nDrone Protests\r\nRare earth crisis\r\nReal estate bubble\r\nLuddite Riots\r\nAntibiotics-Resistant Bacteria\r\nWater shortage\r\nWeather Prediction Technology\r\nVirtual Reality Market Leader\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, Processor 2 GHz (Dual Core), 1 GB RAM (4 GB recommended), Directx 9.0c-compatible 3D graphics card with 256 MB VRAM, 500 MB HDD, DirectX 9.0c-compatible sound card, mouse, keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9a8ed76f28b1fdfbdd85ff671922193b7bbacd","amp;dn":"Democracy+3%3A+Clones+and+Drones+DLC+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9a8ed76f28b1fdfbdd85ff671922193b7bbacd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,154,142,215,111,40,177,253,251,221,133,255,103,25,34,25,59,123,186,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
