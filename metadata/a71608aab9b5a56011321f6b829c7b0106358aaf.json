Algorithms in a Nutshell describes a large number of existing algorithms for solving a variety of problems, and helps you select and implement the right algorithm for your needs -- with just enough math to let you understand and analyze algorithm performance. \n\nWith its focus on application, rather than theory, this book provides efficient code solutions in several programming languages that you can easily adapt to a specific project. Each major algorithm is presented in the style of a design pattern that includes information to help you understand why and when the algorithm is appropriate. \n\nWith this book, you will: \nSolve a particular coding problem or improve on the performance of an existing solution \nQuickly locate algorithms that relate to the problems you want to solve, and determine why a particular algorithm is the right one to use \nGet algorithmic solutions in C, C++, Java, and Ruby with implementation tips \nLearn the expected performance of an algorithm, and the conditions it needs to perform at its best \nDiscover the impact that similar design decisions have on different algorithms \nLearn advanced data structures to improve the efficiency of algorithms \n\nWith Algorithms in a Nutshell, you'll learn how to improve the performance of key algorithms essential for the success of your software applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71608aab9b5a56011321f6b829c7b0106358aaf","amp;dn":"Algorithms+in+a+Nutshell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71608aab9b5a56011321f6b829c7b0106358aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,22,8,170,185,181,165,96,17,50,31,107,130,156,123,1,6,53,138,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
