This can be traced to Baker's earliest sides on Bock's L.A.-based Pacific Jazz label.  This album is the result of Baker's first sessions for the independent Riverside label.  The Chet Baker Quartet featured on Chet Baker Sings It Could Happen to You includes Kenny Drew (piano), Sam Jones (bass), and Philly Joe Jones (drums).  (Performances by bassist George Morrow and drummer Dannie Richmond are featured on a few cuts.)  This results in the successful combination of Baker's fluid and nonchalant West Coast delivery with the tight swinging accuracy of drummer Jones and pianist Drew. Nowhere is this balance better displayed than the opening and closing sides on the original album, &quot;Do It the Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Old Devil Moon,&quot; respectively.  One immediate distinction between these vocal sides and those recorded earlier in the decade for Pacific Jazz is the lissome quality of Baker's playing and, most notably, his increased capacity as a vocalist.  The brilliant song selection certainly doesn't hurt either. ~ Lindsay Plenner, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nChet Baker (Trumpet and Vocals) \nKenny Drew (Piano) \nGeorge Morrow (Double Bass) - 1,2,5,7 \nSam Jones (Double Bass) - 3,4,6,9 \nPhilly Joe Jones (Drums) - 1,2,5,7 \nDanny Richmond (Drums) - 3,4,6,9 \n\nChet Baker - It Could Happen to You Tracks:\n01  Do It The Hard Way (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 3:03 \n02  I'm Old Fashioned (Jerome Kern/Johnny Merce) 5:07 \n03  You're Driving Me Crazy (Walter Donaldson) 2:57 \n04  It Could Happen To You (Johnny Burke/Jimmy Van Heusen) 2:53 \n05  My Heart Stood Still (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 3:28 \n06  The More I See You (Mack Gordon/Harry Warren) 3:06 \n07  Everything Happens To Me (Tom Adair/Matt Dennis) 5:05 \n08  Dancing On the Ceiling (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 3:09 \n09  How Long Has This Been Going On (George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin) 4:11 \n10  Old Devil Moon (E.Y. &quot;Yip&quot; Harburg/Burton Lane) 2:58 \n11  While My Lady Sleeps (Take 10) (Gus Kahn/Bronislaw Kaper) 4:19 \n12  You Make Me Feel So Young (Take 5) (Mack Gordon/Josef Myrow) 3:38 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2035ea8856bb28b94ae403cbee38b4708eed3e98","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+It+Could+Happen+to+You+%281958%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2035ea8856bb28b94ae403cbee38b4708eed3e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,53,234,136,86,187,40,185,74,228,3,203,238,56,180,112,142,237,62,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
