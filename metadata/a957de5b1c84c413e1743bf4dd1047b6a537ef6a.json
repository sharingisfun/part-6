This workshop from author and trainer David Powers is designed to change that by teaching you PHP through a series of clear, focused, easy-to-follow lessons. After briefly explaining what PHP is and how it integrates with HTML, David will guide you through the setup and configuration of a PHP development environment on both Windows and Mac OS X. Then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the features of the PHP language through a series of hands-on exercises before embarking on a larger project that involves building a script to validate and email user input from an online form. Through this project youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come to understand the value of creating reusable code, the importance of PHP security, and how to deal with multiple-choice form fields.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a957de5b1c84c413e1743bf4dd1047b6a537ef6a","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Introducing+PHP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a957de5b1c84c413e1743bf4dd1047b6a537ef6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,87,222,91,28,132,196,19,225,116,59,244,221,16,71,182,165,55,239,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
