When PI Nick Heller moves back to Boston to set up his own agency, he soon gets an urgent case even closer to home than expected. Alexandra Marcus - teenage daughter of hedge fund titan Marshall Marcus - has been kidnapped. But it's no ordinary kidnapping - and it's not even clear what they want. She's been abducted by professionals and buried alive in an underground casket. A video camera is streaming her desperate pleas live over the internet. With only a limited supply of food and water, her time is quickly running out. A close friend of the family, Nick is more determined than ever to catch the perpetrators. But when Marshall is arrested for fraud, Nick uncovers some powerful enemies and a conspiracy that reaches up to the very highest levels of government. Faced with opponents well-protected by wealth and position, Nick must play a dangerous game if he hopes to flush out those responsible before Alexa is buried for good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f4d4666e6307b42278a6197dba91e59fe675fa","amp;dn":"Joseph+Finder+-+Buried+Secrets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f4d4666e6307b42278a6197dba91e59fe675fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,244,212,102,110,99,7,180,34,120,166,25,125,186,145,229,159,230,117,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
