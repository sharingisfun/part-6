Featured in a score of original software titles since then (not counting numerous anthologies and cameo appearances), the series' hero, Larry Laffer, is a bumbling, persistent everyman who just wants to be loved. Is that so wrong?\n  \nFrom original designer Al Lowe (designer of all of Larry's classic adventures) and writer Josh Mandel, Replay Games is remaking the landmark first game for a new generation. Expanded and enhanced in every detail and ready for both mobile devices and PCs. Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is being reborn for the players who might've seen their parents (or grandparents!) playing Larry behind closed doors.\n\n \nINSTALLATION INFORMATION:\n---------------------------\nUnpack, mount and copy to applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77eb84fcf240208a011afc08813462b7819cc81","amp;dn":"Leisure+Suit+Larry+Reloaded+MACOSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77eb84fcf240208a011afc08813462b7819cc81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,126,184,79,207,36,2,8,160,17,175,192,136,19,70,43,120,25,204,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
