He has never left his home, a mysterious castle of seven towers.\n\nBut Tal cannot stay safe forever. His father has disappeared. His mother has fallen ill. His future ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ once bright ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ now seems dim. The source of all power within the castle world are Sunstones, brilliant objects of light and magic. TalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Sunstone has been stolen . . . and now he must get a new one, at any cost.\n\nSinister and evil forces are working against Tal, tracking his every move and making sure his journey is not an easy one. Soon they will propel him from the castle . . . and into a world beyond his belief.\n\nAs TalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s efforts to get a Sunstone are constantly thwarted, he becomes more and more desperate. In a stunning turn of events, he finds himself battling an Imperial Guard named Ethar in a fierce game called Beastmaker... &quot;\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Back cover of Castle]\n\n&quot;The Dark World is a place of ice, wind and fury. A veil of black covers the sky. In all the world, only the Castle shines with light.\n\nTal had gotten used to traveling with Milla when she was wounded ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ and quiet. He wasn't sure about traveling with her once she was healthy. He never knew what she was going to do, and he suspected that she would still like to kill him. In MillaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s mind, Tal had never been more than a trespasser who'd come up with a good excuse to save himself.\n\nStill, she had sworn an oath. He could probably trust her ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ at least until they got to the Castle. Then Tal would have a whole new set of troubles...&quot;\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Back cover Aenir]\n\n&quot;Tal and Milla are on a quest in the dream world of Aenir, where impossible things happen all the time, and danger haunts every moment.\n\nTal must find the one thing that can save his family and his world ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ but to do so he might have to pay an unthinkable price.&quot;\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Back cover of Above the Veil]\n\n&quot;Pursued deep into the depths of the Castle, below the seven levels where the Chosen live, below where even the Underfolk dwell, Tal and Milla encounter their old foe, Crow. The rebel Underfolk has the ability to help them save the Dark World way of life, but life in the Castle is not something Crow wishes to preserve.\n\nTal has no choice but to embark on a harrowing adventure with Crow as his partner. The two venture back up one of the seven towers in pursuit of a keystone that they hope will unlock the CastleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s secrets...&quot;\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Back cover of Into Battle]\n\n&quot;The Dark World is in danger, for the Veil is vulnerable. War is soon to come. On one side are Tal and the Underfolk rebels, struggling vailantly for freedom. On another side are Milla and the Icecarls, preparing to assault the Castle in order to preserve their world.\n\nAnd on a third side lies the most sinister force of all ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ a force of evil that has only now chosen to reveal itself ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ a force of such power that it could unleash the ultimate destruction.&quot;\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Back cover of The Violet Keystone]\n\n&quot;Tal and Milla are only one step away from death. Evil is only one step away from triumph. An old war is made new again. The Ultimate power is up for grabs.\n\nAs shadows rage, ancient spells return. Illusion reigns and corruption threatens.
