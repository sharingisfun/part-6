Now, for the first time, he gives us a magnificent, single-volume history of the entire conflict. Through his strikingly detailed stories of everyday peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€of soldiers, sailors and airmen; British housewives and Indian peasants; SS killers and the citizens of LeningradÃ¢â‚¬â€Hastings provides a singularly intimate portrait of the world at war. Remarkably informed and wide-ranging, Inferno is both elegantly written and cogently argued. Above all, it is a new and essential understanding of one of the greatest and bloodiest events of the twentieth century.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nHastings continues a recent substantial body of general audience writing on WWII (Armageddon; Retribution,) in this equally well-researched and well-presented account focusing on the conflictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s human dimension, looking at both soldiers and civilians, members of both Allies and Axis. For millions of ordinary people the war was Ã¢â‚¬Å“hell let loose,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ imposing, at the least, drastic change and, at worst, incomprehensible horrorÃ¢â‚¬â€60 million died. Participants assembled the Ã¢â‚¬Å“vast jigsaw puzzleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of war with the pieces they had and made sense of it in terms of their own circumstances. Hastings succeeds admirably in synthesizing the results in a globe-girdling context from Guadalcanal to the Dnieper River. He establishes, in some sense, the temporary nature of warÃ¢â‚¬â€that soldiers seldom lost their identity as civilians in uniform, and civilians counted the days until normality returned. That mind-set determined the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nature: structured by mass participation and institutional effectiveness. In Russia, for instance, the German invasion led to Ã¢â‚¬Å“a surge of popular enthusiasmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to support Russia, followed rapidly by despair and men trying to evade the draft. As Hastings makes clear, the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact also outlasted the conflict: for decades people judged one another by their wartime behavior; for many the psychological impact of the horrors never left them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460299b570eebf66b6424f35b7470dd3a27749fe","amp;dn":"Max+Hastings+-+Inferno%3A+The+World+at+War%2C+1939-1945","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460299b570eebf66b6424f35b7470dd3a27749fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,2,153,181,112,238,191,102,182,66,79,53,183,71,13,211,162,119,73,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
