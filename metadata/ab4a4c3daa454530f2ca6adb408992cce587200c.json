All three are written by C.B. Cebulski and have great art as well as interesting adaptations of world folklore. Some of my favorites are the Avengers version of Peter Pan, the Spider-Man Cinderella, and the African tale of the Eagle and the Tortoise represented as Magneto and Xavier respectively. each story not only is faithful to the original on which is it based, but uses the comic characters as great stand-ins and often makes you think about them in a new way. All credit to the orginal scanners of these collections, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4a4c3daa454530f2ca6adb408992cce587200c","amp;dn":"Marvel+Fairy+Tales+%282006-2008%2C+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4a4c3daa454530f2ca6adb408992cce587200c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,74,76,61,170,69,69,48,242,202,106,219,64,137,146,204,229,135,32,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
