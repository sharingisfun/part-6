Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated Ã¢â‚¬â€ and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.\n\nRichard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability &quot;to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.&quot; She writes &quot;with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,&quot; said the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation, but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92ed04e61babc94ad639ec53dfca94bf577daed8","amp;dn":"The+Heart+Is+a+Lonely+Hunter+by+Carson+McCullers+%28Retail+-+Reque","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92ed04e61babc94ad639ec53dfca94bf577daed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,237,4,230,27,171,201,74,214,57,236,83,223,202,148,191,87,125,174,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
