Robert Pollard and his stable of beer buddies/backing musicians had been churning out stuff like Bee Thousand for years, but the album's surprise critical success marked the first time the group found a significant audience outside their hometown, and it made a clear case for Guided by Voices' virtues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as their flaws. From the moment &quot;Hardcore UFOs&quot; kicks in, it's obvious that Pollard has an uncanny gift for a hook and a melody, and Bee Thousand's 20 cuts are dotted with miniature masterpieces like &quot;Echos Myron,&quot; &quot;Smothered in Hugs,&quot; and &quot;Queen of Cans and Jars.&quot; However, there are also more than a few duds that threaten to cancel out the goodwill the great songs generate, and Pollard is an acquired taste as a lyricist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his freakishly poetic verse has a real charm, but it's hard to figure out what he's on about. (GBV's other principal songwriter, Tobin Sprout, contributes less often, but manages a higher batting average.) The lo-tech rumble of the album's D.I.Y. production also wavers between being a help and a hindrance, depending on the songs, and as musicians Guided by Voices veer between sounding like inspired amateurs and, well, just amateurs. On Bee Thousand, Guided by Voices sounds like a passionate and gloriously quirky garage band fronted by a thrillingly and maddeningly idiosyncratic songwriter; its many pearly moments make it a fascinating discovery for rock enthusiasts, but a few years would pass before this band was fully earning the new accolades showered upon it.\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5ace7ee0de370d31f7d69a4e1526a382b72ae8","amp;dn":"Guided+By+Voices+-+Bee+Thousand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5ace7ee0de370d31f7d69a4e1526a382b72ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,90,206,126,224,222,55,13,49,247,214,154,78,21,38,163,130,183,42,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
