But the patients in her care have not all moved on so far. A white supremacist couple can dictate that no person of colour treats their newborn child.\r\nAnd when that baby stops breathing on Ruthâ€™s watch, Ruth has to decide whether her vocational oath is stronger than the hospitalâ€™s edict.\r\nThat decision â€“ one a white nurse would never have had to make â€“ could cost her everything.\r\nNever afraid to confront the moral dilemmas of our times in the most human terms, this new novel is Jodi Picoult at her most thought-provoking, life-affirming best. A powerful look at the judgements we make, the differences between us â€“ and the humanity that binds us together.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8dcc70df6e5e4dce147d54c4b41556cc74010ed","amp;dn":"Small+Great+Things+-+Jodi+Picoult+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8dcc70df6e5e4dce147d54c4b41556cc74010ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,220,199,13,246,229,228,220,225,71,213,76,75,65,85,108,199,64,16,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
