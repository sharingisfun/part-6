Formed in late 1965 in a small town in Texas by Electric Jug playing Tommy Hall, guitarist &amp; vocalist Roky Erickson, guitarist Stacy Sutherland they were joined by bass player Benny Thurman, and drummer John Ike Walton; at a time where Baptist and Mormon preachers fought for the populationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual wellbeing, and Country &amp; Western music filled the bars on a Saturday night.\n\nOut of these conflicting extremes, the Elevators were born and began making a name for themselves in the burgeoning music scene in Austin, Texas.\n\nThough Roky Erickson was the frontman, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound and philosophy were created by the unpredictable &amp; impulsive Tommy Hall. The Elevators followed their own spiritual cosmic route searching for a new path to enlightenment whilst all the while creating a reputation for excess. The band developed a sound that merged garage-punk and psychedelic experimentation. Their music, from the beginning, played and created under the influence of LSD, was raw, ambitious and hugely experimental with SutherlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pioneering use of reverb and echo, and bluesy, acid-drenched guitar mixed with Tommy HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innovative electric jug ? Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpsychedelic rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was conceived.\n\nThis two CD media-book edition catches the band with its classic line-up before the release of Ã¢â‚¬ËœEaster EverywhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and is the only known complete recording of an ElevatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gig, and the latest to survive. Put together by band expert Paul Drummond, who also contributes extensive liner notes and mastered by Sonic Boom (Spacemen 3), this release also includes one reel unissued for over forty-five years.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9e6367a3d85395753434bc302cc7dd0f66480a8","amp;dn":"13th+Floor+Elevators+-+Live+Evolution+Lost+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9e6367a3d85395753434bc302cc7dd0f66480a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,230,54,122,61,133,57,87,83,67,75,195,2,204,125,208,246,100,128,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
