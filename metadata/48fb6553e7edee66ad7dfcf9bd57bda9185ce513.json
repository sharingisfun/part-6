At once more dance-flirting and garage-punky than most recordings by other My Bloody Valentine obsessives that emerged in the early &amp;#039;90s, though suffering the same underplaying in the vocal department, Whirlpool builds nicely on the three earlier EP releases with a similar sense of &quot;what the hey -- if it works, try it.&quot; As an album, it doesn&amp;#039;t per se connect as a unified piece -- the final track listing comes from a variety of recording sessions with a large number of producers and remixers, including Robin Guthrie, Stephen Hague, John Fryer, and Ralph Jezzard. As a collection of mostly killer tracks, though, this is mighty fine. &quot;Breather&quot; kicks it off with a rushing shudder that mixes its acoustic and electric guitars well, while &quot;Pearl&quot; throws in trancey beats, John Bonham samples, and some fine art-glazed feedback riffs to create as perfect a nugget of the era as any. &quot;Falling Down&quot; has similar heavy-groove action to it, Madchester as played by Loop. Other highlights are more strictly rocky, like the slow-build/rave-up/freak-out/repeat &quot;Autosleeper&quot; and &quot;April,&quot; with a big guitar wash up and out through the length of the song. A gentler version of early track &quot;Something More&quot; closes the album well; the overall effect is strong promise for whatever would come next.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Breather&quot; (Andrew Sherriff) ? 4:20\n   2. &quot;Pearl&quot; (Sherriff) ? 4:52\n   3. &quot;Autosleeper&quot; (Stephen Patman) ? 4:50\n   4. &quot;Treasure&quot; (Patman) ? 6:22\n   5. &quot;Falling Down&quot; (Sherriff) ? 3:58\n   6. &quot;April&quot; (Sherriff) ? 4:39\n   7. &quot;Guilt&quot; (Patman, Sherriff) ? 4:15\n   8. &quot;If You Want Me&quot; (Russell Barrett, Sherriff) ? 2:41\n   9. &quot;Something More&quot; (Sherriff) ? 3:20\n\nGood music NEVER gets old!\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fb6553e7edee66ad7dfcf9bd57bda9185ce513","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+Chapterhouse+-+Whirlpool+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fb6553e7edee66ad7dfcf9bd57bda9185ce513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,251,101,83,231,237,238,102,173,125,252,249,189,87,189,169,24,92,229,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
