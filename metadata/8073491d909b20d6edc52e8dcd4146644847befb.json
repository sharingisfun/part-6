In the past Bill has been a High School teacher and football coach, AP rep, Medical photographer, and Marketing Public Relations person. In 1991 he and his wife Sherelene founded the Great American Photography Weekends and for 12 years he ran the field events for the company, running over 250 events in every major national park and in Africa and the Galapagos Islands. Bill is the author of five photography books, including his newest - America From 500 Feet II\n\nWinter is not the most popular season for taking landscape photographs, but Bill Fortney shows us that there is still plenty to capture at his favorite spots in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. While grand landscape photography captures the beauty of a large scene, intimate landscape photography focuses on small, unique parts of that landscape and extracts from the overall scene. During this course, Bill recommends equipment for getting started with landscape photography. He talks about image composition, the importance of texture, and how he uses lines of direction when composing his photos. In later lessons, Bill takes viewers into his digital darkroom to talk about his favorite processing techniques and software. Follow along as Bill teaches photographers how to find, compose, and create wonderful, intimate landscape photographs.\n\nLesson 01 Introduction (1:54)\nLesson 02 Equipment (4:23)\nLesson 03 Leading Lines (4:17)\nLesson 04 Old Grist Mill (9:36)\nLesson 05 Church Grounds (7:52)\nLesson 06 Cabin in the Woods (7:05)\nLesson 07 Water in Motion and Icicles (4:51)\nLesson 08 Extraction (3:25)\nLesson 09 Image Processing (3:59)\nLesson 10 Saturation (3:48)\nLesson 11 Nikon Capture NX2 (4:30)\nLesson 12 HDR Photo (6:04)\nLesson 13 Conclusion (2:38)\n\nTOTAL: 01:04:22\n\n_______________!!!!
