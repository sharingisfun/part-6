(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nGinger Baker was rock's first superstar drummer and the most influential percussionist of the 1960s. There were other drummers who were well-known to the public before him, including the Beatles' Ringo Starr and, in England at the end of the '50s, the Shadows' Tony Meehan, but they were famous primarily for the groups in which they played and for attributes beyond their musicianship. Baker made his name entirely on his playing, initially as showcased in Cream, but far transcending even that trio's relatively brief existence. Though he only cut top-selling records for a period of about three years at the end of the '60s, virtually every drummer of every heavy metal band that has followed since that time has sought to emulate some aspect of Baker's playing.\n\n\nGenre................: Jazz\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.Ginger Spice\n02.Twelve And More Blues\n03.Cyril Davis\n04.Footprints\n05.AÃƒÂ¯n TÃƒÂ©mouchent\n06.St. Thomas\n07.Aiko Biaye\n08.Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57e47f68c6261a437f00f60b0a2716e80c750c5","amp;dn":"Ginger+Baker+-+Why%3F+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57e47f68c6261a437f00f60b0a2716e80c750c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,126,71,246,140,98,97,164,55,240,15,96,176,162,113,110,128,199,80,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
