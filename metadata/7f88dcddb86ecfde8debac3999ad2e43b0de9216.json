Dreamin' Wild is the sonic vision of the talented Emerson boys, recorded in a family built home studio in rural Washington State. Situated in the unlikely blink-and-you-missed-it town of Fruitland and far removed from the late 1970s punk movement and the larger disco boom, Donnie and Joe tilled their own musical soil, channeling bedroom pop jams, raw funk, and yacht rock. The duo's 'Baby' is an extremely haunting slice of Psych Folk laced with Soul. Light In The Attic.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f88dcddb86ecfde8debac3999ad2e43b0de9216","amp;dn":"Donnie+%26amp%3B+Joe+Emerson+-+Dreamin%27+Wild+%281979%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f88dcddb86ecfde8debac3999ad2e43b0de9216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,136,220,221,184,110,207,222,141,235,172,57,153,173,46,67,176,222,146,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
