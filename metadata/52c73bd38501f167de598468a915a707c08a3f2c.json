Already with cynicism, Marlowe takes on an assignment from the Sternwood family: the child-woman Carmen, the sultry Frances, and the ancient General too far past his prime to cope with his daughter's brand of trouble. Stepping in to deal with a case of blackmail, Marlowe follows a trail that leads him into a landscape littered with murder and deception.\n\nsorry about the poor audio quality\n\nRead by Elliott Gould\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52c73bd38501f167de598468a915a707c08a3f2c","amp;dn":"Raymond+Chandler+-+The+Big+Sleep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52c73bd38501f167de598468a915a707c08a3f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,199,59,211,133,1,241,103,222,89,132,104,169,21,167,7,192,138,63,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
