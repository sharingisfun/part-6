Please see IMDB link for few more details. Also note there appears to be a Hollywood remake of this coming out in 2012 - but I figure that this original version is better.\n\nThe 2012 remake IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/\n\n\nSpecs: 560x288, XVID MPEG-4, 25fps, AC-3 5.1 @ 384Kbps.\n\n\nLooks like a good movie, I've only previewed it while fixing up subtitles and converting it for DVD (yes, it's burn tested) but I look forward to watching it. Video and audio are both very good - it's a nice rip. It was RAR'ed when I found it; now it's 2 CD's (unRARed) in AVI format, and a subtitle.srt file for each AVI.\n\nNote that there were/are VERY few peers/seeders for this movie when it found me, so please share it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da5bb996fe71b4352f73533a85c4fdffd03d3c1","amp;dn":"Argo.2004.DVDRip.XviD-TriX.NORAR.EngSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da5bb996fe71b4352f73533a85c4fdffd03d3c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,165,187,153,111,231,27,67,82,247,53,51,168,92,79,223,253,3,211,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
