While humans will no longer generally starve to death if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t preserve food at home (as we once would have done) we still enjoy the self-reliance that doing so brings.\n\nA Beginners Guide to Home Canning &amp; Food Preserving is for anyone wanting to learn the art of Home Canning. The book cover such topics as:\n\nHistory of Food Preservation\nDefinitions of Various Food Preservation Methods\nFood Safety and Safety Precautions\nSourcing Tools, Equipment and Food\nAltitude Adjustments\nWater Bath Canning Details &amp; Pressure Canning Details\nRecipes Including Jams, Jellies, Butters, Chutneys, Relishes, Pickles and Meat Fish and Poultry\n\nIf you are an old hand at food preserving and canning you may even find a new recipe included in book.\n\nAlthough the canning process is the most labor intensive procedure, all methods promote a sense of pride, accomplishment, and self-reliance. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like opening the pantry or freezer door on a frigid winterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day, where the snow - already up to the window sills - is coming down so hard you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see your mailbox, and finding row upon row of neatly labeled produce and meats and remembering once again that if the world ended outside your door, your family would still eat well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0cdafdb649f029ecb4e6660d4777053865ca15","amp;dn":"A+Beginners+Guide+to+Home+Canning+%26amp%3B+Food+Preserving%3A+Recipes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0cdafdb649f029ecb4e6660d4777053865ca15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,12,218,253,182,73,240,41,236,180,230,102,13,71,119,5,56,101,202,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
