Here are a few of the reasons why I believe this book will work equally well for you:\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for anyone who wants to learn the core features of the Java language:\n\n- It works if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to programming.\n- It works if you have programming experience with another language.\n- It works if you already know an older version of Java and you want to get up-to-speed with Java SE 7.\n- It works if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already read 3 or 4 other Java books and still donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to develop a real-world application.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to programming, the prerequisites are minimal. You just need to be familiar with the operation of the platform that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using. That means you should know how to perform tasks like opening, saving, printing, closing, copying, and deleting files.\n\nTable of contents\nSection 1: Essential Java skills\nChapter 1.
