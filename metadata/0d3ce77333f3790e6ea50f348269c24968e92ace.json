Have Fun with it\n\n1. Install the program.\n2. Copy SimplifyLoader to the program directory - something like C:Program FilesSimplify 3D 3.0.2\n3. Change the destkop shortcut to point to the SimplifyLoader. \n4. Happy printing! :)\n\n\nI compiled the program with visual studio so you may need to download the Visual C++ redistributable. And yes it is because i'm lazy! :P\nIf you get a Error try using try downloading &quot;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784&quot; and/or install All in One Runtimes&quot; http://www.sereby.org/site/downloads-AiO\n\nBy the way, sometimes the Loader may be too slow and fail to initiate the program. In that case just execute it again. :)\nTested under windows 10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3ce77333f3790e6ea50f348269c24968e92ace","amp;dn":"Simplify3D+3.0.2+Slicer+for+3DPrinter+x64+ONLY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3ce77333f3790e6ea50f348269c24968e92ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,60,231,115,51,243,121,14,110,165,15,52,130,105,194,73,104,233,42,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
