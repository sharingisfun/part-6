They know foreign languages and cultures and unconventional warfare better than any U.S. fighters, and while they prefer to stay out of the limelight, veteran war correspondent Linda Robinson gained access to their closed world. She traveled with them on the frontlines, interviewed them at length on their home bases, and studied their doctrine, methods and history. In Masters of Chaos she tells their story through a select group of senior sergeants and field-grade officers, a band of unforgettable characters like Rawhide, Killer, Michael T, and Alan - led by the unflappable Lt. Col. Chris Conner and Col. Charlie Cleveland, a brilliant but self-effacing West Pointer who led the largest unconventional war campaign since Vietnam in northern Iraq.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013c804927c84d346d08575fd00dd916a632a26f","amp;dn":"Masters+of+Chaos%3A+The+Secret+History+of+the+Special+Forces+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013c804927c84d346d08575fd00dd916a632a26f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,60,128,73,39,200,77,52,109,8,87,95,208,13,217,22,166,50,162,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
