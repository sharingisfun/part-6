Leary and Mundy are back in another military science fiction adventure as they undertake a mission to a distant but critical star system.\r\n\r\nIT'S JUST A REBELLION IN A DISTANT STAR CLUSTER.\r\n\r\nCaptain Daniel Leary thinks that his marriage will allow him to slip into the quiet role of a naval officer in peacetime. His friend, the spy and cybrarian Adele Mundy, is content to be collating data in her library. But high officials of both superpowers are involved! Those who want Daniel and Adele to become involved in the Tarbell Stars claim that only they can prevent a war between the Republic of Cinnabar and its great rival, the Alliance of Free Stars. The conflict is political, but at the sharp end it means blazing warfare and cold-blooded murder. Daniel and Adele will be at the sharp end.\r\n\r\nRead by Victor Bevine\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a6a6ef3d58be414c25d3bb36188c81f470fac9f","amp;dn":"David+Drake+-+Death%27s+Bright+Day+%28Lt.+Leary+RCN+%2311%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a6a6ef3d58be414c25d3bb36188c81f470fac9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,106,110,243,213,139,228,20,194,93,59,179,97,136,200,31,71,15,172,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
