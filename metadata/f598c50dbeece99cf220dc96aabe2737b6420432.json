Eleven years later, sheâ€™s an unemployed business school graduate sitting in her dying fatherâ€™s New Jersey hospital room. This loss devastates Penny in all the usual ways, and Zinkâ€™s depictions of grief andâ€”especiallyâ€”the strange state of waiting for someone to die are honest and real and occasionally lovely. In one especially heartbreaking scene, Penny realizes that, the closer he gets to death, the less she and Norm have in common. But then: â€œThe strength and courage they desireâ€”and lack, both of themâ€”are the strength and courage never to see each other again. Fear is something they have in common.â€ \r\n\r\nThis level of self-awareness is one of Pennyâ€™s finest qualities as a protagonist. The daughter of a Jewish shamanistic healer and an indigenous Colombian orphan, Penny knows sheâ€™s unusual. But she also accepts that being unusual isnâ€™t all that strange, which is why she finds a new family when she sets out to reclaim her fatherâ€™s ancestral home in Jersey City. Thrown together by the marginalization of tobacco users, the residents of Nicotineâ€”the squat occupying the house where Norm grew upâ€”are outrÃ© outsiders even in the outsider realm of activists and agitators. Penny is immediately smitten with the very cute and avowedly asexual Rob. When Pennyâ€™s sociopathic half brother, Matt, becomes obsessed with another occupantâ€”a polyamorous Kurdish poet named Jazzâ€”they form an untenable tangle of relationships that can only end in destruction. The resulting disaster is spellbinding, but even the quiet moments here are delightful because Zink does such an incredible job of depicting weirdos as real, smart, vulnerable, complicated people","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f598c50dbeece99cf220dc96aabe2737b6420432","amp;dn":"Nicotine+-+Nell+Zink.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f598c50dbeece99cf220dc96aabe2737b6420432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,152,197,13,190,236,233,156,242,32,220,150,170,190,39,55,182,66,4,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
