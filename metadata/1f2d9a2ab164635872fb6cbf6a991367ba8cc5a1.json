Kit \n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nBoston is an American rock band from Boston, Massachusetts that achieved its most notable successes during the 1970s and 1980s. Centered on guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter, and producer Tom Scholz, the band is a staple of classic rock radio playlists.[1] Boston's best-known works include the songs &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Smokin'&quot;, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and &quot;Amanda&quot;. They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, of which 17 million were for their self-titled debut album and 7 million were for their second album, Don't Look Back.[2][3] Altogether, they have released six studio albums. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Boston :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f2d9a2ab164635872fb6cbf6a991367ba8cc5a1","amp;dn":"Boston+-+Studio+Discography+1976+-+2013+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f2d9a2ab164635872fb6cbf6a991367ba8cc5a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,45,154,42,177,100,99,88,114,251,108,191,106,153,19,103,186,140,197,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
