No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des RÃƒÂªves, and it is only open at night.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway: a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into loveÃ¢â‚¬â€a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\n\nTrue love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus perÃ‚Â­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.\n\nWritten in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.\n\n\n\nRead by Jim Dale\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e848cf6ab365fccfb94caa4334db6fc698046a","amp;dn":"Erin+Morgenstern+-+The+Night+Circus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e848cf6ab365fccfb94caa4334db6fc698046a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,232,72,207,106,179,101,252,207,185,76,170,67,52,219,111,198,152,4,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
