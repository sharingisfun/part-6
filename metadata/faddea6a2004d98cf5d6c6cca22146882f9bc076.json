Mitnick claims that this social engineering tactic was the single-most effective method in his arsenal. This indispensable book examines a variety of maneuvers that are aimed at deceiving unsuspecting victims, while it also addresses ways to prevent social engineering threats.\n\nExamines social engineering, the science of influencing a target to perform a desired task or divulge information\nArms you with invaluable information about the many methods of trickery that hackers use in order to gather information with the intent of executing identity theft, fraud, or gaining computer system access\nReveals vital steps for preventing social engineering threats\n\nSocial Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking does its part to prepare you against nefarious hackersÃ¢â‚¬â€now you can do your part by putting to good use the critical information within its pages.\n\nFrom the Author: Defining Neuro-Linguistic Hacking (NLH)\nAuthor Chris Hadnagy\nNLH is a combination of the use of key parts of neuro-lingusitic programming, the functionality of microexpressions, body language, gestures and blend it all together to understand how to Ã¢â‚¬Å“hackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the human infrastructure. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take a closer at each to see how it applies.\n\nNeuro-Lingusitic Programming (NLP): NLP is a controversial approach to psychotherapy and organizational change based on &quot;a model of interpersonal communication chiefly concerned with the relationship between successful patterns of behavior and the subjective experiences underlying them&quot; and &quot;a system of alternative therapy based on this which seeks to educate people in self-awareness and effective communication, and to change their patterns of mental and emotional behavior&quot;\n\nNeuro: This points to our nervous system which we process our five senses:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Visual\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Auditory\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Kinesthetic\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Smell\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Taste\n\nLinguistic: This points to how we use language and other nonverbal communication systems through which our neural representations are coded, ordered and given meaning. This can include things like:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Pictures\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sounds\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Feelings\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Tastes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Smells\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Words\n\nProgramming: This is our ability to discover and utilize the programs that we run in our neurological systems to achieve our specific and desired outcomes.\n\nIn short, NLP is how to use the language of the mind to consistently achieve, modify and alter our specific and desired outcomes (or that of a target).\n\nMicroexpressions are the involuntary muscular reactions to emotions we feel. As the brain processes emotions it causes nerves to constrict certain muscle groups in the face. Those reactions can last from 1/25th of a second to 1 second and reveal a personÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true emotions.\n\nMuch study has been done on microexpressions as well as what is being labeled as subtle microexpressions. A subtle microexpression is an important part of NLH training as a social engineer as many people will display subtle hints of these expressions and give you clues as to their feelings.\n\n\nFollow us on facebook...\na rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faddea6a2004d98cf5d6c6cca22146882f9bc076","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Human+Hacking+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faddea6a2004d98cf5d6c6cca22146882f9bc076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,221,234,106,32,4,217,140,245,214,198,204,162,33,70,136,47,155,192,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
