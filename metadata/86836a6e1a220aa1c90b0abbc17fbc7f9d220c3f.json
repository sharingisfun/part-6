Initially marketed as a singer/songwriter, John soon revealed he could craft Beatlesque pop and pound out rockers with equal aplomb. He could dip into soul, disco, and country, as well as classic pop balladry and even progressive rock. His versatility, combined with his effortless melodic skills, dynamic charisma, and flamboyant stage shows, made him the most popular recording artist of the '70s. Unlike many pop stars, John was able to sustain his popularity, charting a Top 40 single every single year from 1970 to 1996. During that time, he had temporary slumps in creativity and sales, as he fell out of favor with critics, had fights with his lyricist, Bernie Taupin, and battled various addictions and public scandals. But through it all, John remained a remarkably popular artist, and many of his songs -- including &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; -- became contemporary pop standards.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Weight Of The World\n02.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n03.Blue Eyes\n04.Candle In The Wind\n05.Blessed\n06.I Stop And I Breathe\n07.Sacrifice\n08.A Word In Spanish\n09.Can You Feel The Love Tonight\n10.Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long Long Time)\n11.Your Song\n12.Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n13.Idol\n14.Daniel\n15.Nikita\n16.The One\n17.Circle Of Life\n18.Believe\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Electricity\n02.Bridge\n03.All That I'm Allowed\n04.Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC)\n05.Turn The Lights Out When You Leave\n06.Tinderbox\n07.Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\n08.Tiny Dancer\n09.Honky Cat\n10.Bennie And The Jets\n11.Someone Saved My Life Tonight\n12.Crocodile Rock\n13.I'm Still Standing\n14.I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\n15.Something About The Way You Look Tonight\n16.I Want Love\n17.This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
