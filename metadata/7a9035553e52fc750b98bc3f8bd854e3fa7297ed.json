By using Capybara, you can develop robust tests quickly and run them in multiple drivers ensuring greater re-use; CapybaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s API also extends the human readable style made popular by frameworks such as Cucumber and RSpec.\n\n&quot;Application Testing with Capybara&quot; takes you from installing the gem to getting up and running with a YouTube search scenario within the first two chapters. We then look deeper into the API, using Rack-Test for applications built with Rails or Sinatra and see how to test handle Asynchronous JavaScript and Ã¢â‚¬Å“black boxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ components such as Flash. Finally, we consider some advanced topics such as looking at alternatives to Selenium and accessing the native driver directly.\n\nThis book takes you from the basics of installing Capybara, through its API and onto advanced topics. You will learn how to use CapybaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive API to interact with your application, covering topics such as navigation, filling in forms, and querying your page for expected content. Beyond this we will consider why Capybara is so well suited to testing applications written in frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra. We will look at strategies for validating seemingly Ã¢â‚¬Å“untestableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ components such as HTML5 or Flash by building out a testable API. Finally we will turn you into a Capybara ninja by covering advanced topics such as accessing functionality in the base driver, advanced driver configuration, and alternative flavours of drivers outside Selenium and Rack-Test.\nApproach\n\nStart performing integration testing with Capybara immediately. This book will get you up and running quickly and assumes no knowledge or experience of the technology.\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for developers and testers who have had some exposure to Ruby but who want to know how to test their applications using Capybara and its compatible drivers, such as Selenium-Webdriver and Rack-Test. The examples are deliberately kept simple and example HTML mark-up is always included so that you can copy the examples to practice and experiment on your own machine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9035553e52fc750b98bc3f8bd854e3fa7297ed","amp;dn":"Application+Testing+with+Capybara+%5BPDF%5D%7EStorm%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9035553e52fc750b98bc3f8bd854e3fa7297ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,144,53,85,62,82,252,117,11,152,188,63,139,216,84,227,250,114,151,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
