Following the intrigue and action of &quot;The Burning Land &quot;and &quot;Sword Song,&quot; this latest chapter in Bernard Cornwell's epic saga of England is a gripping tale of divided loyalties and mounting chaos. At a crucial moment in time, as Alfred the Great lays dying, the fate of all--Angles, Saxons, and Vikings alike--hangs desperately in the balance. For all fans of classic Cornwell adventures, such as &quot;Agincourt&quot; and &quot;Stonehenge,&quot; and for readers of William Dietrich's &quot;Hadrian's Wall&quot; or Robert E. Howard's &quot;Bran Mak Morn,&quot; the stunning &quot;Death of Kings &quot;will prove once again why the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; calls Bernard Cornwell &quot;the most prolific and successful historical novelist in the world today.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9d8871585ce070aaaccb05915c9f80cf7e1f15","amp;dn":"Death+of+Kings+%28The+Saxon+Stories+%23+6%29+-+Bernard+Cornwell.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9d8871585ce070aaaccb05915c9f80cf7e1f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,157,136,113,88,92,224,112,170,172,203,5,145,92,159,128,207,126,31,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
