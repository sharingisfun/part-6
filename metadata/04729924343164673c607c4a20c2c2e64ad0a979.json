The bakers take on biscuits     \n  and these bite-sized, delicate delights prove too much for some. As   \n  always starting with the signature bake, the remaining eight must     \n  impress legendary cookery writer Mary Berry and artisan baker Paul    \n  Hollywood with their interpretation of a classic biscuit. Who will    \n  crumble when it comes to judging and whose ginger nuts are too hot    \n  to handle? Next up, the technical challenge, where following a Mary   \n  Berry recipe is not as simple as it would seem for our bakers, who    \n  start feeling the pressure when faced with brandy snaps. Finally,     \n  the toughest showstopper challenge yet as they attempt to bake and    \n  present a macaroon display that must taste as good as it looks. With  \n  five hours on the clock, every second counts. This is the last        \n  chance to impress the judges before someone's dream of becoming       \n  Britain's best amateur baker is over.                                 \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;97e0a3f1f4e5f2e0d7f0faf6fefbb9f4f8fa&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04729924343164673c607c4a20c2c2e64ad0a979","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off.S02E04.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04729924343164673c607c4a20c2c2e64ad0a979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,114,153,36,52,49,100,103,60,96,124,74,32,194,194,230,74,208,169,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
