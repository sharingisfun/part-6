She has never quite fit in at school or at home.\n\nWhen a dark stranger begins watching her from afar, and her prankster best friend becomes strangely protective of her, Meghan senses that everything she's known is about to change.\n\nBut she could never have guessed the truth - that she is the daughter of a mythical faery king and is a pawn in a deadly war. Now Meghan will learn just how far she'll go to save someone she cares about, to stop a mysterious evil, no faery creature dare face; and to find love with a young prince who might rather see her dead than let her touch his icy heart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e822bd09efc39554f9cd434233d7af21e521c91","amp;dn":"Julie+Kagawa+-+Iron+Fey+1+-+The+Iron+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e822bd09efc39554f9cd434233d7af21e521c91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,130,43,208,158,252,57,85,79,156,212,52,35,61,122,242,30,82,28,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
