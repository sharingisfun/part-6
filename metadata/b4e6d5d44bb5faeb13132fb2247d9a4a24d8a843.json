Now we return to that famous courthouse in Clanton as Jake Brigance once again finds himself embroiled in a fiercely controversial trial-a trial that will expose old racial tensions and force Ford County to confront its tortured history.\n\nSeth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.\n\nThe second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e6d5d44bb5faeb13132fb2247d9a4a24d8a843","amp;dn":"Sycamore+Row+by+John+Grisham+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e6d5d44bb5faeb13132fb2247d9a4a24d8a843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,230,213,212,75,181,250,235,19,19,47,178,36,125,154,74,36,216,168,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
