Patel, &quot;Introduction to Electrical Power and Power Electronics&quot;\n\n2013 | ISBN-10: 1466556609 | 528 pages | PDF | 38 MB\n\nMost traditional power systems textbooks focus on high-voltage transmission. However, the majority of power engineers work in urban factories, buildings, or industries where power comes from utility companies or is self-generated. Introduction to Electrical Power and Power Electronics is the first book of its kind to cover the entire scope of electrical power and power electronics systems in one volumeÃ¢â‚¬â€with a focus on topics that are directly relevant in power engineersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ daily work.\n\nLearn How Electrical Power Is Generated, Distributed, and Utilized\n\nComposed of 17 chapters, the book is organized into two parts. The first part introduces aspects of electrical power that most power engineers are involved in during their careers, including the distribution of power to load equipment such as motors via step-down transformers, cables, circuit breakers, relays, and fuses. For engineers working with standalone power plants, it also tackles generators. The book discusses how to design and operate systems for economic use of power and covers the use of batteries in greater depth than typically found in traditional power system texts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549dc0da9b72ce8fbeb95c12bdd5764826cae833","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Electrical+Power+and+Power+Electronics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549dc0da9b72ce8fbeb95c12bdd5764826cae833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,157,192,218,155,114,206,143,190,185,92,18,189,213,118,72,38,202,232,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
