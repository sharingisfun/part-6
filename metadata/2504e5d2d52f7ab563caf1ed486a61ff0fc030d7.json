But their habit gets the better of them, consumes them and destroys their dreams. &quot;Selby's place is in the front rank of American novelists. His work has the power, the intimacy with suffering and morality, the honesty and moral urgency of Dostoevsky's....To understand Selby's work is to understand the anguish of America.&quot; -- The New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2504e5d2d52f7ab563caf1ed486a61ff0fc030d7","amp;dn":"Requiem+For+a+Dream+-+Hubert+Selby+Jr..epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2504e5d2d52f7ab563caf1ed486a61ff0fc030d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,4,229,210,213,47,122,181,99,202,241,237,72,106,97,255,15,192,48,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
