He was, without doubt, a trail blazer who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming, devices that often were virtually without theoretical precedent. It was Tesla who introduced us to the fundamentals of robotry, computers, and missile science and helped pave the way for such space-age technologies as satellites, microwaves, beam weapons, and nuclear fusion. Yet, Tesla still remains one of the least-recognized scientific pioneers in history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21741d4ff0ba8ad3887af351e6f6420198980441","amp;dn":"Tesla%3A+Man+Out+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21741d4ff0ba8ad3887af351e6f6420198980441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,116,29,79,240,186,138,211,136,122,243,81,230,246,66,1,152,152,4,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
