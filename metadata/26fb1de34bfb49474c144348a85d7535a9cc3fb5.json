Geils Band\nAnthology Houseparty (1993)\n\n\n\n\nThe J. Geils Band was one of the most popular touring rock &amp; roll bands in America during the '70s. Where their contemporaries were influenced by the heavy boogie of British blues-rock and the ear-splitting sonic adventures of psychedelia, the J. Geils Band was a bar band pure and simple, churning out greasy covers of obscure R&amp;B, doo wop, and soul tunes, cutting them with a healthy dose of Stonesy swagger. While their muscular sound and the hyper jive of frontman Peter Wolf packed arenas across America, it only rarely earned them hit singles. Seth Justman, the group's main songwriter, could turn out catchy R&amp;B-based rockers like &quot;Give It to Me&quot; and &quot;Must of Got Lost,&quot; but these hits never led to stardom, primarily because the group had trouble capturing the energy of its live sound in the studio. In the early '80s, the group tempered its driving rock with some pop, and the makeover paid off with the massive hit single &quot;Centerfold,&quot; which stayed at number one for six weeks. By the time the band prepared to record a follow-up, tensions between Justman and Wolf had grown considerably, resulting in Wolf's departure, which quickly led to the band's demise. After working for years to reach to top of the charts, the J. Geils Band couldn't stay there once they finally achieved their goal. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Cruisin' For A Love\n02.Homework\n03.Looking For A Love\n04.It Ain't What You Do (It's How You Do It!)\n05.The Usual Place\n06.Cry One More Time\n07.Dead Presidents\n08.Give It To Me (Single Mix Edit)\n09.Southside Shuffle\n10.Make Up Your Mind\n11.Gettin' Out (Single Edit)\n12.Detroit Breakdown\n13.Givin' It All Up\n14.Must Of Got Lost (Single Edit)\n15.Believe In Me\n16.Love-Itis\n17.Where Did Our Love Go\n18.Peanut Butter\n19.Surrender\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Sno-Cone (Live)\n02.Wait (Live)\n03.Hard Drivin' Man (Live)\n04.First I Look At The Purse (Live)\n05.Pack Fair And Square (Live)\n06.Whammer Jammer (Live)\n07.Musta Got Lost (Live)\n08.Start All Over (Live)\n09.Houseparty (Live)\n10.I Do (Live)\n11.Just Can't Wait\n12.Love Stinks\n13.Night Time\n14.Flamethrower\n15.Centerfold\n16.Freeze-Frame\n17.Sanctuary\n18.One Last Kiss\n19.Teresa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n   \n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fb1de34bfb49474c144348a85d7535a9cc3fb5","amp;dn":"The+J.+Geils+Band+-+Anthology+2CD+%5B1993%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fb1de34bfb49474c144348a85d7535a9cc3fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,251,29,227,75,251,73,71,76,20,67,72,168,93,117,53,169,204,63,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
