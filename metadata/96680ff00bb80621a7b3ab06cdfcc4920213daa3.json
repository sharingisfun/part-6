Building  a project is only half the work. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finishing the piece, too. And for many woodworkers the finishing portion of the job constitutes much more than 50 percent of the job (maybe as high as 75 or 80 percent). And this is why there are so many projects finished with wipe-on polyurethane or a simple oil/varnish mixture applied.\n\nThose are not terrible finishes. There are projects and pieces of furniture that require a clear or semi-clear finish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ think inlay, contemporary design or mixed hardwoods. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve used an oil/varnish blend on many pieces throughout the years. But when these finishes are used simply because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re easy, so much of the potential \nfinish of the project is lost. Sure you see the wood grain. And you may even highlight some of the interesting figure in your wood. But if your desire is to have your projects blend well with antiques or with other stained furniture in your home, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not often going to make that happen with wipe-on finishes.\n\nWhat I hear most of the time is that finishing methods other than wipe-on finishes are difficult. I disagree. Since the day I hung out my shingle to earn a living while working with wood, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve used the same finishing method and the results speak for themselves. In fact, Popular Woodworking first approached me, so many years ago, due to my finish on tiger maple.\n\nYou can read about my favorite methods free on our web site, in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFinishing Formulas,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a story I wrote for the April 2007 issue:\nhttp://www.popularwoodworking.com/article/Finishing_Formulas/\n\nAnd right now, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re putting the finishing touches (ha ha) on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFinishes that Pop,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a show-and-tell DVD on exactly the same finishing method that I use on my furniture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pieces youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen in the pages of Popular Woodworking and in my books. On it, I discuss project preparation, shellac, glaze and more. So for now, enjoy the story. And look for the DVD in early September 2009.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Glen D.
