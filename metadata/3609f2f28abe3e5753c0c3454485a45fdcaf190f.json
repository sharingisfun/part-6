His teaching style and ability to easily communicate new knowledge in an easily approachable method are key to learning the craft.  Whenever I start working with a new photog, the FIRST set of books and video I point them to are ALWAYS from Bryan!\n\nMy recommendation is to use all of his offerings:\nThe Perfect Picture                - &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5333457&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5333457&lt;/a&gt; \nLearning to See Creatively         - &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5383729&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5383729&lt;/a&gt; \nUnderstanding Exposure             - &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3899818&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3899818&lt;/a&gt; \nUnderstanding Shutter Speed        - &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5383482&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5383482&lt;/a&gt; \nUnderstanding Close Up Photography - &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5384888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5384888&lt;/a&gt; \n\nand you will be well on your way to being a photographer!  :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBryan_Peterson/Bryan_Peterson-Understanding_Shutter_Speed.pdf [215257740]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProduct Description:\nPaperback: 160 pages\nPublisher: Amphoto Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0817463011\nISBN-13: 978-0817463014\n\nThe first book in the Understanding Photography series, Understanding Exposure, was a runaway best-seller, with more than 250,000 copies sold. Now author Bryan Peterson brings his signature style to another important photography topic: shutter speed. With clear, jargon-free explanations of terms and techniques, plus compelling &quot;before-and-after&quot; photos that pair a mediocre image (created using the wrong shutter speed) with a great image (created using the right shutter speed), this is the definitive practical guide to mastering an often-confusing subject. Topics include freezing and implying motion, panning, zooming, exposure, Bogen Super Clamps, and rendering motion effects with Photoshop, all with helpful guidance for both digital and film formats. Great for beginners and serious amateurs, Understanding Shutter Speed is the definitive handy guide to mastering shutter speed for superb results.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author\nBryan Peterson, a professional photographer, is the author of Understanding Exposure, Beyond Portraiture, Learning to See Creatively, and Understanding Digital Photography. A well-known instructor, he is the founder of the online school The Perfect Picture School of Photography (www.ppsop.com).  He is also the best-selling author of Understanding Exposure, Learning to See Creatively, Understanding Shutter Speed, Understanding Close-Up Photography, Understanding Digital Photography, Beyond Portraiture, and, most recently, Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide. His easy-to-understand writing and teaching style breaks down the complex and often confusing aspects of photography, translating them into what his students routinely describe as &quot;aha&quot; moments. In addition, he has been a commercial photographer for over 30 years, shooting annual reports for many Fortune 500 companies, and his trademark use of color and strong, graphic composition have garnered him many photographic awards, including the New York Art Director's Gold Award and honors from Communication Arts and Print magazine. He currently splits his time between Chicago and France.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal addition:  He has also managed to marry one totally SMOKING hot wife, whom I can only guess he met while on a photo assignment...  or at least, that's what it would imply as while he's a terrific instructor/author, and a FABULOUS photographer, he's certainly not what one would call &quot;classically handsome&quot; so if you want to meet a model and have them be impressed with your work and set yourself apart from the GWC (Guy With Camera) gaggle, take a hint from Bryan and become the kind of photographer that stands out apart from the rest and learn all you can from his books and video.  Then, I would recommend practice practice practice for 6-12 months, and then see about signing up for his online School with a solid foundation in the fundamentals and see where he might take you to the next level!  Who knows, before you know it, you just might one day find yourself also in the category of &quot;How in the world did a guy like THAT, manage to get himself a gal like a HER?!?!?!&quot; :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3609f2f28abe3e5753c0c3454485a45fdcaf190f","amp;dn":"Photography-Bryan_Peterson-Understanding_Shutter_Speed-PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3609f2f28abe3e5753c0c3454485a45fdcaf190f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,9,242,242,138,190,62,87,83,192,195,69,68,133,164,95,220,175,25,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
