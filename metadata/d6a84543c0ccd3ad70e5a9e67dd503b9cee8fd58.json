The film vividly exposes a monstrous and unconstitutional &quot;deep state&quot; in which multiple competing chains of command -- all but one illegal -- hijack government capabilities and taxpayer funds to commit crimes against humanity in our name. Anyone who cares about democracy, good government, and the future will want to watch all five segments of this remarkable film.&quot; - Robert David STEELE Vivas: CIA, USMC, OSS, Earth Intelligence Network and Founder, Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog\n\n\n\nACCLAIM:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A beautifully crafted and thought provoking journey through AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret wars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nTrevor Paglen\nAuthor, The Dark Geography of the Pentagon's Secret World\n&quot;An extraordinary work by a gifted filmmaker, &quot;Counter-Intelligence&quot; shines sunlight into the darkest crevices of empire run amok. The film vividly exposes a monstrous and unconstitutional &quot;deep state&quot; in which multiple competing chains of command -- all but one illegal -- hijack government capabilities and taxpayer funds to commit crimes against humanity in our name. Anyone who cares about democracy, good government, and the future will want to watch all five segments of this remarkable film.&quot;\nRobert David STEELE Vivas\nCIA, USMC, OSS, Earth Intelligence Network and Founder, Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog\n&quot;Sunshine is the best disinfectant. With Counter-Intelligence, Scott Noble is here to clean house.&quot;\nStephen Lendman\nVeterans Today\n&quot;A compelling, prodigious work,&quot;\nKathy Christison\nFormer CIA Officer\n&quot;A groundbreaking, much needed review of the structure and operational capability of America's intelligence bureaucracy.&quot;\nBo Filter\nauthor of The Cause of Wars and Aggression\n&quot;Scott Noble may have outdone himself with Counter Intelligence. The Psywar filmmaker amassed a tour de force of power elite and deep state scholars weighing in and synthesizing decades of research. From the rise of the national security state and mass proliferation of state/corporate propaganda to the normalization of constant, now remote (drone) warfare and the ongoing decay of constitutional rights, Noble lays out some of the most significant, yet oft overlooked or outright censored information about one of the most significant issues of our timesÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Black-Ops. Noble helps expose the real conspiracies of the powerful factually, transparently, and responsibly. It's a film that should be screening across the US, but given the nature and subject of the film, don't count on it. Share and show it far and wide. Counter-Intelligence would be an excellent addition to college classes on political science, history, sociology, or critical thinking to spark debate and discussion, utilizing what's left of our First Amendment rights while we still can.&quot;\nMickey Huff\nDirector, Project Censored/Media Freedom Foundation and Professor of Social Science and History, Diablo Valley College\n\nSOURCES:\nJohn Pilger - The Lies of Hiroshima are the Lies of Today\nNBC News\nThe Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb\nRedmond, Matt\nPrompt and Utter Destruction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ TrumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Decision to Launch the Atomic Bomb\nRouse, Ed\nPsychological Operations in War\nMarx, Gary T.\nOn a Neglected Category of Social Movement Participant\nFresia, Jerry\nOn a Neglected Category of Social Movement Participant\nFresia, Jerry\nToward an American Revolution - Exposing the Constitution and other Illusions\nSimpson, Christopher\nThe Science of Coercion\nGlobal Security\nManagement of Covert Actions in the Truman Presidency\nEllsberg, Daniel\nSecrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers\nAgee, Phillip\nCIA Diary\nAdelaide Gerlach, Steve Gerlach\nCoup DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢etat in Australia\nPilger, John\nThe War on Democracy\nWake Up Magazine\nThe CIA in Australia\nCIA\nA Study of Assassination\nTalbot, Ann\nBritain: Documentary reveals plan for coup against Wilson labor government\nIsenberg, David\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu for Dyncorp all over again\nDowbenko, Uri\nDirty Tricks, Inc.
