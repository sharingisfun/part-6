It peaked at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and features five singles: &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;I Changed My Mind&quot;, &quot;(I Just Want It) To Be Over&quot;, &quot;I Should Have Cheated&quot;, and &quot;Love&quot;. The album debuted at number six on the U.S. charts with first week sales of 89,000. It was finally certified gold within 17 weeks, and then platinum just eight weeks later. The album stayed on the charts for over a year, eventually selling over 1.4 million copies. This is her only album so far that had a parental advisory label on it.\n\nAmazon.com - KEYSHIA COLE is the real deal. Like many young people raised in tough neighborhoods, the 21-year-old songstress endured a tumultuous childhood in Oakland, California, and has fought all her life to keep her dream of a music career alive. Now sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s realizing that dream on her own terms with her first album for the A&amp;M label, The Way It Is. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a long road for Keyshia, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s her powerful voice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a bell-like instrument whose soaring clarity is topped off with a tantalizing touch of soulful grit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s carried her through, not to mention the diminutive singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal combination of sugar, spice, sass and sex appeal, along with a solid-steel spine. With production by Kanye West, Krucial Keys, Ron Fair and Chink Santana, KeyshiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreams have been realized.\n\nAndy Kellman, All Music Guide - An advantage Keyshia Cole has over a lot of her young contemporaries is experience. As a foster child growing up in Oakland, she went through a lot of downs, and from the sounds of The Way It Is, her first album, she's had her share of complex relationships. Cole had a hand in the writing of just about every track, and she has a number of major players -- Kanye West, John Legend, Alicia Keys, Ron Fair (Christina Aguilera, Mya), E-Poppi (Missy Elliott, Destiny's Child) -- in her corner. With only a couple exceptions, The Way It Is is about the ugly parts of a romantic relationship, so there's little room left for upbeat material. From the opener, &quot;(I Just Want It) To Be Over,&quot; the album seems to be set up like a linear narrative about a crumbling relationship, but it doesn't quite play out that way, with the scenes shuffled out of order. (&quot;Love,&quot; one of the positive songs, comes after the song where the punk gets dumped and before the song where he's called out for changing.) None of it's all that profound, but Cole sells it all extremely well, especially on &quot;I Should Have Cheated,&quot; where she tires of an accusing and hypocritical lover (&quot;I should go have my fun and do all the things you say I do&quot;). Cole's voice is sweet and ringing, like a wiser version of Lil' Mo who has had to weather a tremendous amount of drama. She could be around for a while. (&quot;Never,&quot; her hit song from the Barbershop 2 soundtrack, is included.) \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] (I Just Want It) To Be Over\t\n[02] I Changed My Mind\t\t\t\n[03] Thought You Had My Back\t\t\n[04] I Should Have Cheated\t\t\n[05] Guess What?\t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Jadakiss\n[06] Love\t\t\t\t\n[07] You've Changed\t\t\t\n[08] We Could Be\t\t\t\n[09] Situations\t\t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Chink Santana\n[10] Down &amp; Dirty\t\t\t\n[11] Superstar\t\t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Metro City\n[12] Never\t\t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Eve\n[13] I Changed My Mind \t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Shyne (Remix)\n[14] Love \t\t\t\t---&gt;Featuring Kanye West [Live AOL Session]\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:57m:35s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 143mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.0.1.11 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B\nRelease Date\t&gt; 21 June 2005\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.keyshiacole.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyshia_Cole \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/k/keyshiacole.html \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/keyshiacole \n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/keyshiacole \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a9c87783697364f2bedea7e8a9b28ec209e061","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+The+Way+It+Is+-+Keyshia+Cole+143mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a9c87783697364f2bedea7e8a9b28ec209e061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,169,200,119,131,105,115,100,242,190,222,167,232,169,178,142,194,9,224,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
