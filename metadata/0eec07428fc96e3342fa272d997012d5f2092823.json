Nine-year-old Felix (Ã‰douard Tremblay-Grenier) is terrified of almost everything â€” a terror fuelled by his isolation from the adult world as his parents deal with their own dramas. (Convinced at one point that he has contracted HIV, Felix hides in his closet for hours until his older sister intervenes.) Set during a sleepy late summer, Les dÃ©mons somehow suggests both surface calm and a hazy sense of menace that starts to enclose the film as rumours of unsolved child abductions creep into its hero's fraught consciousness. Inspired by Lesage's own childhood, the character of Felix is akin to the lost kids of Sleeping Giant and Closet Monster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eec07428fc96e3342fa272d997012d5f2092823","amp;dn":"Les+Demons+2015+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eec07428fc96e3342fa272d997012d5f2092823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,236,7,66,143,201,110,51,66,250,39,45,153,112,18,213,242,9,40,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
