The album, out on Impulse! this week, is a memento of collaboration between the guitarist Jim Hall and the bassist Charlie Haden, profound musicians whose departures knocked the jazz world back on its heels. (Mr. Hall died last December, at 83; Mr. Haden was 76 when he died in July.) But the music, recorded in concert at the 1990 Montreal International Jazz Festival, could hardly feel more alive. This is the earliest known duologue between two masters of the form, and the delight behind the interplay is obvious. Their ballad work Ã¢â‚¬â€ on the standards Ã¢â‚¬Å“SkylarkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Body and Soul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Mr. HadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“First SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ is extraordinary even by their high standards. Just as rewarding are pieces by Ornette Coleman (Ã¢â‚¬Å“TurnaroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Thelonious Monk (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bemsha SwingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and a calypsoesque theme by Mr. Hall (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Down From AntiguaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). At every turn, you hear the unpretentious wisdom and honest intuition in these artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ styles, along with their sheer alertness to the moment.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2014/10/14/356125487/an-unofficial-memorial-for-jazz-greats-jim-hall-and-charlie-haden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2014/10/14/356125487/an-unofficial-memorial-for-jazz-greats-jim-hall-and-charlie-haden&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045127edd166c48e5d6f42b02d5d30ec924f9686","amp;dn":"Charlie+Haden+%26amp%3B+Jim+Hall+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045127edd166c48e5d6f42b02d5d30ec924f9686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,81,39,237,209,102,196,142,93,111,66,176,45,93,48,236,146,79,150,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
