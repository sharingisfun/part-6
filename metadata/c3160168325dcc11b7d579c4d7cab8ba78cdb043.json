Ã¢â‚¬Å“You think I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it right here in the open. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be surprised. . . . YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll drop before you get the breath to scream.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n \nThe truck driver is decked out like a rhinestone cowboy, only instead of a guitar heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slinging a gunÃ¢â‚¬â€and Odd Thomas is on the wrong end of the barrel. Though he narrowly dodges a bullet, Odd canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t outrun the shocking vision burned into his mind . . . or the destiny that will drive him into a harrowing showdown with absolute evil.\n \nDEEPLY ODD\n \nHow do you make sure a crime that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happened yet, never does? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the critical question facing Odd Thomas, the young man with a unique ability to commune with restless spirits and help them find justice and peace. But this time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the living who desperately need Odd on their side. Three helpless innocents will be brutally executed unless Odd can intervene in time. Who the potential victims are and where they can be found remain a mystery. The only thing Odd knows for sure is who the killer will be: the homicidal stranger who tried to shoot him dead in a small-town parking lot. \n \nWith the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock riding shotgun and a network of unlikely allies providing help along the way, Odd embarks on an interstate game of cat and mouse with his sinister quarry. He will soon learn that his adversary possesses abilities that may surpass his own and operates in service to infinitely more formidable foes, with murder a mere prelude to much deeper designs. Traveling across a landscape haunted by portents of impending catastrophe, Odd will do what he must and go where his path leads him, drawing ever closer to the dark heart of his long journeyÃ¢â‚¬â€and, perhaps, to the bright light beyond.\n \nACCLAIM FOR DEAN KOONTZ AND HIS ODD THOMAS NOVELS\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Koontz gives his character wit, good humor, a familiarity with the dark side of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€and moral outrage.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€USA Today\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is Koontz working at his pinnacle, providing terrific entertainment that deals seriously with some of the deepest themes of human existence: the nature of evil, the grip of fate and the power of love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Supernatural thrills with a side of laughs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Denver Post\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The nice young fry cook with the occult powers is KoontzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most likable creation . . . candid, upright, amusing and sometimes withering.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3160168325dcc11b7d579c4d7cab8ba78cdb043","amp;dn":"Deeply+Odd+-+Dean+Koontz+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3160168325dcc11b7d579c4d7cab8ba78cdb043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,22,1,104,50,93,204,17,183,213,121,196,215,202,184,186,120,205,176,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
