In New York, a man sensing patterns in the stock market racks up $300 billion. In Chicago, a woman can go invisible by being where no one is looking. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re called &quot;brilliants,&quot; and since 1980, one percent of people have been born this way. Nick Cooper is among them; a federal agent, Cooper has gifts rendering him exceptional at hunting terrorists. His latest target may be the most dangerous man alive, a brilliant drenched in blood and intent on provoking civil war. But to catch him, Cooper will have to violate everything he believes in - and betray his own kind.\n\nFrom Marcus Sakey, &quot;a modern master of suspense&quot; (Chicago Sun-Times) and &quot;one of our best storytellers&quot; (Michael Connelly), comes an adventure thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at once breakneck thriller and shrewd social commentary; a gripping tale of a world fundamentally different and yet horrifyingly similar to our own, where being born gifted can be a terrible curse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2678ea8b59561e4fd9b00c88d4ab8d425c14ea","amp;dn":"+Brilliance+-+Marcus+Sakey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2678ea8b59561e4fd9b00c88d4ab8d425c14ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,38,120,234,139,89,86,30,79,217,176,12,136,212,171,141,66,92,20,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
