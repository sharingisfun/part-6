First airing as a Comedy Playhouse pilot, the series aired for seven series until 1975. Six years later, ITV continued the sitcom, calling it Till Death.... From 1985 to 1992, the BBC produced a sequel In Sickness and in Health.\n\nCreated by Johnny Speight, Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family, led by patriarch Alf Garnett (Warren Mitchell), a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist and anti-socialist views. His gentle and long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols, and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs. Rita's bright but layabout husband Mike Rawlins (Antony Booth) is a socialist. The character Alf Garnett became a well known character in British culture, and Mitchell played him on stage and television up until 1998, when Speight died.\n\nTo Garnett A Grandson \t13 September 1972 \t\nPigeon Fancier \t20 September 1972 \t\nHoliday in Bournemouth \t27 September 1972 \t\nDock Pilfering \t11 October 1972 \t\nUp The Hammers \t18 October 1972 \t\nAlf's Broken Leg \t25 October 1972 \t\n[edit] Christmas Special\nTitle \tAirdate \tDescription\nJesus Christ Superstar \t26 December 1972","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9a4df3c9baad507281e45abc7d1afad117928d8","amp;dn":"Till+Death+Do+Us+Part++Series+4+++1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9a4df3c9baad507281e45abc7d1afad117928d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,164,223,60,155,170,213,7,40,30,69,171,199,209,175,173,17,121,40,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
