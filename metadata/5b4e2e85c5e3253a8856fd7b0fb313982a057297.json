The sound is fairly diverse, actually going\nbetween moderate rock and metal in the same song at some points. Rachel Bolan does a good job filling in on bass duties in the studio and Jim Root's guitar work is\nimmaculate. The drums sometimes sound over-compressed to me, but just by a tad. The\nalbum is really a good example of what a hard rock album should sound like &quot;in sharp contrast to a lot of popular music that gets passed off as hard rock on the radio.\n\nThe songs have hooks but they aren't over-dominated by the hooks; they just have their proper place in the song. Big choruses in several of the songs, a few heavier songs that go into the realm of metal and a few slower quieter songs mixed in. Fans of Stone Sour will not be disappointed. There will also be a companion comic released by Dark Horse comics as a storyline for the album, and an additional comic will release as well with &quot;Part 2&quot; of &quot;House Of Gold &amp; Bones&quot; to be released in early 2013.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Gone sovereign                                       [04:03]\n02.Absolute zero                                        [03:50]\n03.A rumor of skin                                      [04:11]\n04.The travelers, pt. 1                                 [02:27]\n05.Tired                                                [04:12]\n06.RU486                                                [04:22]\n07.My name is allen                                     [04:18]\n08.Taciturn                                             [05:26]\n09.Influence of A drowsy god                            [04:29]\n10.The travelers, pt. 2                                 [03:02]\n11.Last of the real                                     [03:01]\n________\n43:21 min\n 71,5 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
