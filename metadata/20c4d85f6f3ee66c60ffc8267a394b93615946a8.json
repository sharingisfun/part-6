Even the bones and muscles that give us strength and speed depend on many types of cells. Throughout the book you will learn things to do to keep your body healthy, though in a fallen, cursed world things are bound to go wrong, such as disease and injuries. As our journey through the human body progresses, it will be evident that this marvelous structure did not arise by chance.
