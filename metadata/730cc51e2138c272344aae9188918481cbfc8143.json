This program integrates a lifetime of in the trenches experience, coupled with years of extensive research. \n\nDon't expect a picture book filled with secret exercises or bogus promises. There is nothing new under the sun. This 250 page manual will outline a complete system, from A to Z, covering all aspects of physical training. \n\nThe philosophy behind this program is simple. If it works, we will use it. This program is not limited to one training style (ex. bodyweight exercise vs. weight training). This manual incorporates the best of both worlds. \n\nA sample 50 day routine is provided which applies the principles detailed throughout the manual.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730cc51e2138c272344aae9188918481cbfc8143","amp;dn":"ross+enamait+-+infinite+intensity+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730cc51e2138c272344aae9188918481cbfc8143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,12,197,30,33,56,194,114,52,74,174,145,136,145,132,129,203,252,129,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
