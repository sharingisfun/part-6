T. Jaynes (Author), G. Larry Bretthorst (Editor)\n\nPublication Date: June 9, 2003 | ISBN-10: 0521592712 | ISBN-13: 978-0521592710\n\nGoing beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, this study views the subject in a wider context. It discusses new results, along with applications of probability theory to a variety of problems. The book contains many exercises and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate-level courses involving data analysis. Aimed at readers already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher, it is of interest to scientists concerned with inference from incomplete information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d949b460469a0efc6209f15343dcf6a38707adaf","amp;dn":"Probability+Theory%3A+The+Logic+of+Science+-+E.+T.+Jaynes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d949b460469a0efc6209f15343dcf6a38707adaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,73,180,96,70,154,14,252,98,9,241,83,67,220,246,163,135,7,173,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
