Its goal is to find, test, diagnose and repair hard disk drive problems, report and display SSD and HDD health, performance degradations and failures. Hard Disk Sentinel gives complete textual description, tips and displays/reports the most comprehensive information about the hard disks and solid state disks inside the computer and in external enclosures (USB hard disks / e-SATA hard disks). Many different alerts and report options are available to ensure maximum safety of your valuable data.\n\nNo need to use separate tools to verify internal hard disks, external hard disks, SSDs, disks in RAID arrays as these are all included in a single software.\n\nHard Disk Sentinel monitors hard disk drive / HDD status including health, temperature and all S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) values for all hard disks. Also it measures the disk transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect possible hard disk failures, performance degradations.\n\nHDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to prevent HDD failure and SSD / HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive disk health rating system which is extremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even a small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version has scheduled and automatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only failure but by malware or accidental delete also.\n\nHow does Hard Disk Sentinel work?\n\nHDD Sentinel runs in the background and verifies SSD / HDD health status by inspecting the SMART status of the disk(s). If an error is found or unexpected behaviour is detected, it warns the user about the current situation and also can perform appropriate actions (for example, start an automatic backup).\n\nUsually, hard disk health status may slowly decline, from day to day. The SMART monitoring technology can predict HDD failure by examining the critical values of the disk drive. Compared to other software, Hard Disk Sentinel detects and reports every disk problem. It is much more sensitive to disk failures and can display better and more detailed information about hard disk expected life and the problems found (if any). This is a more sophisticated way to predict failures than the &quot;traditional&quot; method: checking S.M.A.R.T. attribute thresholds and values only. For more information, please read how hard disk S.M.A.R.T. works and why Hard Disk Sentinel is different.\n\nThe software displays the current hard disk temperature and logs maximum and average HDD temperatures. This may be used to check the maximum temperature under high hard disk load. For the importance of the hard disk operating temperature, see the Frequently Asked Questions. See the list of Features of Hard Disk Sentinel Professional or our products for hard disk monitoring.\n\nDo I need Hard Disk Sentinel?\n\nIf you are using a computer equipped with at least one hard disk or solid state disk and you want to ensure that your data will be available any time, then the answer is YES. Hard Disk Sentinel is especially designed to you if\n\nyou are using multiple hard disks / SSDs in your computer (IDE / Serial ATA (S-ATA, e-SATA) / SCSI / SAS / USB hard disks) or in an external enclosure \n(check the hardware compatibility pages for the list of compatible hardware)\nyou are using a mobile / removable rack or enclosure with hard disk inside\nyou are using notebook computer\nyou are using server or desktop computers with high disk load\nyou want to maximize system stability, HDD performance and overall integrity, receive HDD alert on high temperature or low health\nyou do not want to lose your sensitive and valuable data, do not want to pay for HDD recovery\nIt is much better to avoid HDD failure than use HDD recovery. Be alerted and prevent HDD data loss with HDSentinel ! Be your HDD life healthy.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows All\n\nHomepage: http://www.hdsentinel.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Apply patch to get registered application.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33985666b62af9d117ccad8dc087f881bf8e57db","amp;dn":"HDSentinel+PRO+v4.50.7+build+6845+Beta+Incl+Patch-MPT+%5BTorDigger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33985666b62af9d117ccad8dc087f881bf8e57db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,152,86,102,182,42,249,209,23,204,173,141,192,135,248,129,191,142,87,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
