His work has explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships.[1] Cohen has been inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received a Prince of Asturias Award for literature.\n\nThe critic Bruce Eder assessed Cohen's overall career in popular music by asserting that &quot;[he is] one of the most fascinating and enigmatic Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ singer/songwriters of the late '60s Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ [and] has retained an audience across four decades of music-making Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon) [in terms of influence], he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who is still working at the outset of the 21st century.&quot;[2]\n\nThe Academy of American Poets has commented more broadly on Cohen's overall career in the arts, including his work as a poet, novelist, and songwriter, stating that &quot;[Cohen's] successful blending of poetry, fiction, and music is made most clear in Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs, published in 1993, which gathered more than 200 of Cohen's poems Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ several novel excerpts, and almost 60 song lyrics Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ While it may seem to some that Leonard Cohen departed from the literary in pursuit of the musical, his fans continue to embrace him as a Renaissance man who straddles the elusive artistic borderlines.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs of Love &amp; Hate 1971 (Reissued 2007)\n\n\nSongs of Love and Hate is Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen's third album. It was mainly recorded in Columbia Studio A in Nashville from September 22Ã¢â‚¬â€œ26, 1970. &quot;Sing Another Song, Boys&quot; was recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 30, 1970. Further recording took place at Trident Studios in London. The album reached #145 on the US Billboard 200, but was his most commercially successful album in many other parts of the world, reaching #4 in the UK and #8 in Australia.[1]\n\nThe album title is descriptive, outlining its main themes. The songs contain emotive language and are frankly personal; &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; ends with the line &quot;Sincerely, L. Cohen&quot;. The back cover of the album bears the lines:\n\nThey locked up a man\nWho wanted to rule the world\nThe fools\nThey locked up the wrong man.\n\nA remastered CD was released in 1995. Simply Vinyl issued a short-lived remastered edition on vinyl in 2002, making it the last Cohen album (aside from Ten New Songs, which was pressed in limited quantities) to go out of print on vinyl. In 2007, Columbia/Legacy released a newly remastered CD with a new book style packaging and a bonus track: a 1968 recording of Dress Rehearsal Rag.\n\nIn 2009, the album (including its bonus track) was included in the 8CD box set Hallelujah - The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection, issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2012 Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the album at #295 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of all Time [1], the only Leonard Cohen album to make the list. It was ranked #74 on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Avalanche&quot; - 5:07\n2.\t&quot;Last Year's Man&quot; - 6:02\n3.\t&quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; - 6:12\n4.\t&quot;Diamonds in the Mine&quot; - 3:52\n5.\t&quot;Love Calls You by Your Name&quot; - 5:44\n6.\t&quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; - 5:15\n7.\t&quot;Sing Another Song, Boys&quot; (Live at the Isle of Wight Festival, August 31, 1970) - 6:17\n8.\t&quot;Joan of Arc&quot; - 6:29\n9.\t&quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; (Bonus track, early version, an outtake recorded during the Songs From a Room sessions, 1968) - 5:37\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d4c9e099f28b53c33c69289aec6d81a7db5c046","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Songs+of+Love+and+Hate+1971+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d4c9e099f28b53c33c69289aec6d81a7db5c046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,76,158,9,159,40,181,60,51,198,146,137,174,198,216,26,125,181,192,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
