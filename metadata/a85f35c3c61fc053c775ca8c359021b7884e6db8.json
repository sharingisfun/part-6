He's the only guy on the team without any powers, though, so cut him a little slack. Then there's Deadpool (MR. Deadpool to you, skippy) -- the regeneratin' degenerate. You can shoot him, stab him, and make with the punchy-punchy right in his face, but nothing can keep the Merc with a Mouth down. What do they have in common?
