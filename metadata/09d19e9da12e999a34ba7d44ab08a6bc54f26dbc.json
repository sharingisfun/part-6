Taking nine pivotal years (1964, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1974, 1979, 1984, 1987, 1995) the personal lives of the characters become intertwined with the political struggles of their home town of Newcastle, and the capital, London. We also see the machinations behind the scenes that affect their lives, often for the worse: slum housing projects, police corruption, the rise of Thatcherism, political sleaze, and specific events like the 1984 Miners' Strike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d19e9da12e999a34ba7d44ab08a6bc54f26dbc","amp;dn":"Our+Friends+In+The+North+1979-1995+Complete+%5Bchilloutdude%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d19e9da12e999a34ba7d44ab08a6bc54f26dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,209,158,157,161,46,153,154,52,186,125,68,171,8,166,188,84,242,109,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
