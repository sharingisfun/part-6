Then she stumbled into my life.\r\nI tried to stay away from her. Tried focusing on moving my merchandise. But one smile from Terra was like a shot to the heart.\r\nSheâ€™s mine now. And no one threatens whatâ€™s mine.\r\n\r\nTerra\r\nIâ€™ve seen a lot of terrible things in my life.\r\nI grew up around lies and deception, and I ran away from all of them.\r\nUntil I met him.\r\nI knew he was corrupt. I knew he was dangerous.\r\nI should have stayed away, but my attraction to him, my need for him, overrode my logic.\r\nNow I love him.\r\nIf he finds out who I am, weâ€™re done and Iâ€™ll be nothing.\r\nI never wanted to be the Mafia princess they tried to make me, but mia familia had other plans. And what mia familia wantsâ€¦it gets.\r\nOnly Michael Tripp can save me.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe38b288f0f71409312cdec04b86b22c48cf17a5","amp;dn":"The+Gun+Runner+-+Scott+Hildreth+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe38b288f0f71409312cdec04b86b22c48cf17a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,56,178,136,240,247,20,9,49,44,222,192,75,134,178,44,72,207,23,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
