He needs money to pay for her care, but his day labor digging wells does not pay enough. A friend connects Nasim to a two-bit promoter who sells tickets to watch Nasim ride a bicycle continuously for a week. The promoter brings in sick and aged spectators, haranguing them to find hope in Nasim&amp;#039;s strength. Aided by his son, who feeds him as he rides, Nasim grinds out the days and shivering nights. Local officials believe this may be a plot and Nasim may be a spy; they try to sabotage him as do those who bet he won&amp;#039;t finish the week. Will desperation alone get Nasim the money? Is any triumph an illusion?&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0092651/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0092651/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB: 7.3/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b06a4d5b5fbf0c3829a67e430557f46a0828ba","amp;dn":"The+Cyclist+%281987%29+Mohsen+Makhmalbaf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b06a4d5b5fbf0c3829a67e430557f46a0828ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,176,106,77,91,95,191,12,56,41,166,126,67,5,87,244,106,8,40,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
