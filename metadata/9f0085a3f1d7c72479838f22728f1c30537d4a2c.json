Enjoy\n\nFeaturing the excellent Love In A Trashcan, Pretty In Black is the second album\nfrom quirky Danish duo Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo. And a fine one it is\ntoo. With a dark, Fifties/early Sixties feel to it, heavy echo effects deluge\nthe vocals throughout much of the production and gorgeously twangy guitars are\nvery much in evidence; Sleepwalking takes this noir-ish slant the furthest,\nechoing Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks theme with its cod-Fifties sound, while\na song like Red Tan only confirms the comparison.\n\nIt also has a sparse Velvet Underground feel to it at times too, made real by\nthe appearance on no fewer than five tracks of ex-Velvet - and now 60 year old -\nMaureen Tucker.\n\nThere is a love of early rock'n'roll on the part of Wagner that floods through\non this record and such affection, when applied properly, works pretty well, as\non tracks like Uncertain Times and Trashcan.\n\nThe lad also likes girl-groups from the period; Ronnie Spector's guesting vocals\non The Ronettes' sounding Ode To L.A., is the icing on the cake of this highly\naddictive album.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0085a3f1d7c72479838f22728f1c30537d4a2c","amp;dn":"The_Raveonettes-Pretty_In_Black-%28Retail%29-2005-ESC+%5BAlternative%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0085a3f1d7c72479838f22728f1c30537d4a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,0,133,163,241,215,199,36,121,131,143,34,114,143,28,48,83,125,74,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
