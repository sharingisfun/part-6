The two met in New York City and discussed forming a band when they coincidentally found themselves on the same flight back to Toronto.The band originally consisted of 13 members including a horn and string section for swing rock.\nThe band's demo record was funded by Richie Havens.One of the first Lighthouse concerts was at Carnegie Hall and in its first year, the band also played at Fillmore East, Fillmore West, Toronto, Boston and Atlantic City pop festivals, and the Monterey and Newport jazz festivals. A free concert at Toronto City Hall in the summer of 1969 drew a reported crowd of 25,000.Their first album, Lighthouse, was released in 1969 by RCA from RCA's Toronto East Sound Studio. This album was well-received by critics but obtained small commercial success.\n\nTheir next album, Suite Feeling, was also recorded in 1969 at Toronto East Sound Studio. It featured two cover songs: The Band's &quot;Chest Fever&quot; and The Beatles' hit &quot;A Day In The Life.&quot; Their third and final album for RCA also turned out to be the last one for original lead singer Pinky Dauvin. The album Peacing It All Together was recorded in RCAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New York studios. The songs &quot;Feel So Good,&quot; &quot;If There Ever was a Time&quot; and &quot;The Chant&quot; were minor hits in Canada during the band's time with RCA.\n\nThe band moved to the record label GRT and TorontoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thunder Sound Studios. Along with this label change came a large change within the band with only five of the original members still remaining. The most notable change was a new lead singer in Bob McBride. In 1971, Lighthouse released One Fine Morning and Thoughts of Moving On. The title track from One Fine Morning was an international and American hit. It was preceded on the Canadian charts by &quot;Hats Off to the Stranger.&quot;\n\n\n\nLighthouse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 40 Years Of Sunny Days 2009-C4\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Hats Off To The Stranger\n02.
