Hayes was one of the creative geniuses behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s. Hayes, Porter, Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, and John Fogerty were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of notable songs for themselves, the duo &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot;, Carla Thomas, and others.\n\nThe hit song &quot;Soul Man&quot; written by Hayes and Porter, and first performed by &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot; has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. This song was also honored by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by Rolling Stone magazine, and by the RIAA as the Songs of the Century.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Hayes also became a recording musician, and he recorded several successful soul albums such as Hot Buttered Soul (1969) and Black Moses (1971). In addition to his work in popular music, Hayes worked as composer of musical scores for motion pictures.\n\nHayes is well known for his musical score for the film Shaft (1971). For his composition of the Theme from Shaft, Hayes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. Other than such distinguished actors as Sidney Poitier and Hattie McDaniel, Hayes became the first African-American to win an Academy Award in any field whatsoever covered by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hayes also won two Grammy Awards for that same year. Later, he was given his third Grammy Award for his music album Black Moses.\n\nDuring 1992, in recognition of his humanitarian work there, Hayes was crowned as the honorary king of the Ada, Ghana region. Hayes also acted in motion pictures and television, such as in the movie, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Then from 1997 to 2005, he lent his distinctive, deep voice to the character &quot;Chef&quot; on the animated TV series South Park, and also to Gandolf &quot;Gandy&quot; Fitch in the TV series The Rockford Files (1974 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 80).\n\nOn August 5, 2003, Isaac Hayes was honored as a BMI Icon at the 203 BMI Urban Awards for his enduring influence on generations of music makers.[2] Throughout his songwriting career, Hayes received five BMI R&amp;B Awards, two BMI Pop Awards, two BMI Urban Awards and six Million-Air citations. As of 2008, his songs generated more than 12 million performances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan You Dig It 2005\n\n\nIn the early to mid-1960s, Isaac Hayes played a seminal role in creating the nascent sound of soul music. Yet, as monumental as his early contributions were, they are dwarfed by the impact of such solo albums as Hot Buttered Soul, Shaft,and Black Moses, all released on the now legendary and highly influential Stax Records label between 1969 and 1975. \n\nCompiled and annotated by Stax biographer Rob Bowman, Ultimate Isaac Hayes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Can You Dig It? is a 2-CD collection of seminal recordings from this period in HayesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career, a time when he redefined the sonic possibilities of black music with tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk on By,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever Can Say Goodbye,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJoy (part 1),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoulsville,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheme from Shaft.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hayes would become the most successful artist Stax ever produced, opening the album market as a commercially viable medium for black artists, and one of the most important musicians in the history of R&amp;B.\n\nIn stores November 1, Ultimate Isaac Hayes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Can You Dig It? includes a bonus DVD featuring three live tracks from Wattstax, a 1972 concert held at the Coliseum in L.A. to raise money for a variety of community needs and to commemorate the 1965 Watts rebellion. Also available is an animation of the modern-funk masterpiece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChocolate Salty BallsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Comedy CentralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hit series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSouth Park.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As his role of Chef, Hayes is the voice of reason and the administrator of cool amongst the misadventures of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman. \n\nHayes was coaxed into the studio by Stax Records in 1968 to cut Presenting Isaac Hayes (its lead single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPrecious, Precious,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes, was edited down from an 18-minute jazz-tinged funk vamp). The platinum-selling Hot Buttered Soul followed and attracted attention for combining jazz improvisation, classically-influenced strings, rock guitar, ballad singing, and R&amp;B rhythm. The Jimmy Webb penned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Bacharach &amp; DavidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk on By,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a 9-minute Hayes original called  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from that recording are featured on this new collection.\n\nThe Isaac Hayes Movement and To Be Continued came next,and then, in 1971, Hayes was commissioned to write the score for Gordon ParksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Shaft, one of the first so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblaxploitationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ flicks. The resulting double album and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheme from ShaftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ single were directly responsible for kick-starting disco and the phenomenon of the black soundtrack. The Shaft album went to #1 on both the pop and R&amp;B album charts, staying on the pop listings for a staggering 60 weeks. Shaft earned Hayes both Academy and GRAMMYÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Awards, and solidified his position as an African-American icon (HayesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soundtracks for two more movies, Three Tough Guys and Truck Turner, are also represented on the CD).\n\nFor his next Stax recording, Black Moses, Hayes returned to covering other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPart Time Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNeed to Belong to Someone,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor the Good Times,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the lone exception being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ co-written with trumpeter Mickey Gregory. In March 1972, Hayes released an instrumental cover of Al GreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Stay Together.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A month later he reunited with former songwriting partner David Porter, releasing a 45 of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t That Loving You Baby,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a Homer BanksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allen Jones song, with a cover of BreadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fall 1971 smash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m-A Want YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the B-side. All are included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Can You Dig It?\n\nLater in 1972, Hayes performed at Reverend Jesse JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s annual PUSH EXPO at ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s International Amphitheater. Three previously unreleased tracks from IsaacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show-closing performance are included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes. Kenny Gamble and Thom BellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBrand New Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Luther IngramÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf Loving You Is Wrong (I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want to Be Right),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and IsaacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heartfelt performance of the old Baptist hymn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHis Eye Is on the Sparrow.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe following year, Hayes focused on writing his own music. Ultimate Isaac Hayes features 13 tracks recorded between 1973 and 1975, and all but two are original compositions. Significantly, one of the exceptions, the set-closing medley of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix/Say a Little Prayer,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a live concert recording with Dionne Warwick. The other track is IsaacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cover of Henry GloverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomeone Made You for Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ originally released as the B-side of his last hit for the Stax label, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWonderful.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Hayes negotiated a deal with ABC Records to create the Hot Buttered Soul label. The two singles from the debut HBS album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChocolate ChipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome Live with Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ both went Top 20 R&amp;B and are both featured on Ultimate Isaac Hayes. Three further HBS singles, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDisco Connection,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock Me Easy Baby (Part 1),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the aforementioned duet with Dionne Warwick, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix/I Say a Little PrayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (all included here in their single edits), all reached the R&amp;B chart.\n\nIn 2002, Isaac Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Universally recognized as a ground-breaking figure in mainstream R&amp;B, soul and black music, some of HayesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important work comes from his time spent recording for the Stax family of labels. Ultimate Isaac Hayes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Can You Dig It? is an essential anthology and historically significant collection from one of music historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most innovative artists.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCD 1\n\n\n1.\tTheme from Shaft\n2.\tPrecious, Precious\n3.\tHyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic\n4.\tAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)\n5.\tNever Can Say Goodbye\n6.\tBy the Time I Get to Phoenix\n7.\tSoulsville\n8.\tWonderful\n9.\tHelp Me Love\n10.\tNeed to Belong to Someone\n11.\tGood Love\n12.\tThe Look of Love\n13.\tDo Your Thing\n14.\tFor the Good Times\n15.\tI Stand Accused\n\n\nCD 2 \n\n\n1.\tWalk on By\n2.\tJoy (part 1)\n3.\tHis Eye Is on the Sparrow\n4.\tBrand New Me\n5.\tIf Loving You Is Wrong (I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want to Be Right)\n6.\tSomeone Made You for Me\n7.\tBaby IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m-A Want You\n8.\tLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Stay Together\n9.\tTheme from The Men\n10.\tI CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Help It (If IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Still in Love With You)\n11.\tTitle Theme (from Three Tough Guys)\n12.\tRun Fay[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on CD] Run\n13.\tChocolate Chip\n14.\tCome Live With Me\n15.\tDisco Connection\n16.\tRock Me Easy Baby (part 1)\n17.\tMedley (with Dionne Warwick): By the Time I Get to Phoenix / I Say a Little Prayer\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52a4ecdaa058b1c9ec8ecd536cbe620ade2ecac","amp;dn":"Issac+Hayes+-+Can+You+Dig+It+2005+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52a4ecdaa058b1c9ec8ecd536cbe620ade2ecac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,42,78,205,170,5,139,28,158,200,236,213,54,203,230,32,173,226,236,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
