Mostly, she paints vignettes of addiction (â€œRejoiceâ€) and physical frailty (â€œBrittle Bonedâ€) and belief, inheriting the unobstructed bloodletting of second- and third-wave emo â€“ â€œSomethingâ€ owes debts to Waxahatchee and Dashboard Confessional â€“ but stripping it free of artifice. She sings without self-consciousness, like on â€œEveryone Doesâ€: â€œYouâ€™re gonna run when you find out who I am/I know Iâ€™m a pile of filthy garbage you will wish youâ€™d never touched.â€\r\nAnd her lyrical precision can be gobstopping, like on â€œSprained Ankleâ€: â€œShaving off breaths/Each one so heavy, each one so cumbersome/Each one a lead weight hanging between my lungs, spilling my guts.â€ The lone sign of hope on this bleak album comes at the beginning, on â€œBlacktop,â€ which reads as a long-shot prayer from a broken person whoâ€™s held on to faith. â€œCome visit me in the back of an ambulance,â€ Ms. Baker pleads, and you hope itâ€™s not too late.\r\nRating 8/10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 Blacktop\r\n02 Sprained Ankle\r\n03 Brittle Boned\r\n04 Everybody Does\r\n05 Good News\r\n06 Something\r\n07 Rejoice\r\n08 Vessels\r\n09 Go Home\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~572-852 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4523b1cee7031cb18507c7d4eafe8f2649f03582","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Julien+Baker+-+Sprained+Ankle+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4523b1cee7031cb18507c7d4eafe8f2649f03582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,35,177,206,231,3,28,177,133,7,199,212,234,254,143,38,73,240,53,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
