Nicholls, Stuart J. Ferguson (AP, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nThis new edition of Bioenergetics presents a clear and up-to-date explanation of the chemiosmotic theory and covers mitochondria, bacteria, and chloroplasts. It takes account of the many newly determined structures, such as ATP synthase and the two photosystems of photosynthesis, that provide molecular insight into chemiosmotic energy transduction. This edition includes additional color figures of protein structures and many newly drawn illustrations designed to enable the reader to grasp the fundamental insights that are derived from knowing the structure. Every chapter has been extensively revised and updated and a new chapter on the study of the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the intact cell is included to satisfy the enormous interest in this topic. Written for students and researchers alike, this book is the most current text on the chemiosmotic theory and membrane bioenergetics available.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n* Chapter on the study of bioenergetics of mitochondria in the intact cell\r\n* Appendix listing protein structure resources\r\n* Additional colour plates of protein structures\r\n* Many newly drawn illustrations\r\n* Website","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec39d49f592a8ce5408593e3b85149f1416b73d8","amp;dn":"Bioenergetics+3rd+ed+-+David+G.+Nicholls%2C+Stuart+J.+Ferguson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec39d49f592a8ce5408593e3b85149f1416b73d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,57,212,159,89,42,140,229,64,133,147,227,184,81,73,241,65,107,115,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
