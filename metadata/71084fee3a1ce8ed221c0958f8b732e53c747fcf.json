When Skynyrd wrote &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; this album is what they were talking about. This is very RAW Skynyrd.\n\nFree Bird - The Movie: Even though they recorded for only 4 short years, Lynyrd Skynyrd  left behind some of rock 'n' roll's most enduring classics. Go back in time and experience the band's true spirit, raw power and three-guitar attack in blistering live performances, revealing interviews and home movies. Includes 15 live performances. Burn to dvd or watch with VLC media player.\n\nWhen the album &quot;One More from the Road&quot; came out, it was great. When the first double cd of the same name came out, it was butchered. The 25th Anniversary was remastered AND restored to theoriginal. When I got the restored version, the other went in the trash.\n\nThese are my rips.\n\n1973 - Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd (Remastered and Expanded)\n1974 - Second Helping (Remastered and Expanded)\n1975 - Nuthin' Fancy (Remastered and Expanded)\n1976 - Gimme Back My Bullets (Remastered and Expanded)\n1977 - Street Survivors (Remastered and Expanded)\n1998 - Skynyrd's First; The Complete Muscle Shoals Album (Remastered)\n2001 - One More from the Road (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition) (Remastered)(2cd)\nAuthorized Bootleg; Live at the Cardiff Capitol Theater - Cardiff, Wales Nov. 04 1975 (Remastered)\nAuthorized Bootleg; Live at Winterland - San Francisco Mar. 07 1976 (Remastered)\nFree_Bird - The Movie\n\nAccurateRip\nEncoder: Lame 3.99.5\nEncoder Settings: Constant Bit Rate 320kbps (Insane)\nEncoding: &quot;SLOW&quot;\nAudio Quality: Very High (Lossy)\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nSample Rate: 44.1KHz\nContains: Album Art, ID Tag(ID3v2.3)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71084fee3a1ce8ed221c0958f8b732e53c747fcf","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+Original+Discography+LAME+3.99.5+-+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71084fee3a1ce8ed221c0958f8b732e53c747fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,8,79,238,58,28,232,237,34,28,9,88,248,183,50,229,60,116,127,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
