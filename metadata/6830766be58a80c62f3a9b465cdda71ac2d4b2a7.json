West Yellowstone airport is situated in southwestern Montana and serves as an entrance to the oldest national park in the United States, Yellowstone National Park. The airport receives seasonal flights from Salt Lake City through SkyWest, operating under Delta Connection. As a gateway to Yellowstone, Big Sky Ski Resort, Island Park, and the Madison River, West Yellowstone serves over 4,000 passengers yearly. The airport boasts an 8400ft long runway, the longest of any HD Orbx airport in North America. At an altitude of 6649ft ASL, West Yellowstone is also the highest in elevation of any Orbx airport. Flying in and out of West Yellowstone is a challenge of its own as the airport is situated in a bowl shaped valley that ranges from six to eight thousand feet in elevation with nearby peaks up to twelve thousand feet high. The region is considered subarctic and after the first snows in early October the airport becomes quiet until the thaw in late May. The airport is capable of handling general aviation all the way up to 747's, as evidenced by Air Force One's visit several years ago.

Homer Airport is sandwiched between the town and the spit. With regular regional flights to Anchorage and a handful of local operators the airport serves as a gateway to many of the isolated communities across Kachemak Bay. The airport is built on a plateau and features approaches over open water and cliffs, and the view is spectacular! In addition to the main airport, Beluga Lake Seaplane Base (5BL) is also depicted for floatplane operations. Both airports are tuned for AI operations and feature some very colorful and interesting static aircraft. This latest airport by Alex Goff is a must have base of operations for exploration of Southern Alaska.\n\n    Highly detailed rendition of PAHO Homer Airport and 5BL Beluga Lake Seaplane Base\n    50cm photoreal coverage of the airport, town, and spit\n    Custom static aircraft types including an Era (Ravn) Alaska Dash 8, Bald Mountain Air DHC-6, Beluga Air DHC-2, and new custom Piper Cub models\n    Detailed interior model of the terminal\n    Ambient occlusion baking and other advanced rendering techniques\n    APX file tuned for AI operations including floatplane operations\n    Many VFR points of interest in the town and on the spit\n    PeopleFlow, ObjectFlow, TextureFlow\n    By Alex Goff\n\n\nMonument Valley\n\nValley of the Rocks. Monument Valley is located on the Arizona-Utah state line and is a large area that includes much of the area surrounding Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. Developer Frank Dainese has constructed 3D models of the mountains by using DEM data and then textured them with photographic images - creating a perfect replica of the real thing. This follows on from his very popular Yosemite freeware release where this method of creating life-like models of mountains was demonstrated. As you can see from the screenshots below, this scenery is breathtaking!\n\n    Twenty 3D model mountains with seasonal textures\n    Photoreal area also seasonally textured\n    Modelled 3D buildings in the area - View Hotel, Welcome Center, airport hotels and Goulding's Lodge\n    Autogen housing and local vegetation\n    Various tourist areas and small farms, scattered throughout the area\n    From the creator of Yosemite freeware, Frank Dainese\n\n\nRedding Municipal Airport\n\nA Tale of Two Airports.
