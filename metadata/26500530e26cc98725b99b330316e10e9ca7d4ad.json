He was denied a new trial in 1985, and has repeatedly been denied parole. As of December 2010 (29 years) Broussard is still incarcerated at California's Folsom State Prison.Kirk Rasmussen, 16, was sentenced to three years in a juvenile center for kicking dirt and leaves to help hide the girl's partially clad body\n\nNeal Jimenez read about the story in the newspaper while visiting friends, wrote a script and turned it in to his instructor while he was an English major at Santa Clara University. He got a &quot;C+&quot; so he rewrote it and received an &quot;A&quot;. Jimenez said, &quot;that the incident is merely the inspiration for the screenplay&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26500530e26cc98725b99b330316e10e9ca7d4ad","amp;dn":"Rivers+Edge+%5B1986%5D+Tim+Hunter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26500530e26cc98725b99b330316e10e9ca7d4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,80,5,48,226,108,201,135,37,185,155,51,3,22,225,14,156,167,212,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
