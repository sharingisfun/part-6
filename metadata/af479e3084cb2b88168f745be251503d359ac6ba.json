B. Cahusac (Author)\nPaperback: 312 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (November 10, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118384016\nISBN-13: 978-1118384015\nFormat: Retail PDF\nNOTE: this is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTIONTo form a strong grounding in human-related sciences it is essential for students to grasp the fundamental concepts of statistical analysis, rather than simply learning to use statistical software. Although the software is useful, it does not arm a student with the skills necessary to formulate the experimental design and analysis of a research project in later years of study or indeed, if working in research.\n\nThis textbook deftly covers a topic that many students find difficult. With an engaging and accessible style it provides the necessary background and tools for students to use statistics confidently and creatively in their studies and future career.\n\nKey features: \n\n\nUp-to-date methodology, techniques and current examples relevant to the analysis of large data sets, putting statistics in context\n\nStrong emphasis on experimental design\n\nClear illustrations throughout that support and clarify the text\n\nA companion website with explanations on how to apply learning to related software packages\n\nThis is an introductory book written for undergraduate biomedical and social science students with a focus on human health, interactions, and disease. It is also useful for graduate students in these areas, and for practitioners requiring a modern refresher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af479e3084cb2b88168f745be251503d359ac6ba","amp;dn":"Starting+out+in+Statistics%2C+Human+Health%2C+Disease%2C+and+Psycholog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af479e3084cb2b88168f745be251503d359ac6ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,71,158,48,132,203,43,136,22,143,116,91,226,81,80,61,53,154,198,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
