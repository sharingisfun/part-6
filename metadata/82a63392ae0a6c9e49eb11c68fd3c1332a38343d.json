Green's ingenuity \nproduced one of the all-time classics, which has the bounce \nof a dance cut and the passion of a ballad. The dynamic \nsoul singer's whispers, animated cries, and riffing enhance \nhis already stirring delivery. This album was sold on the \nstrength of the title track as there were no other selections to \ngrace the Billboard charts. However, this album includes the \ntimeless gem &amp;quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&amp;quot; and \nlesser-known beauties like the exulting &amp;quot;Judy,&amp;quot; the cookin' \ntestimonial &amp;quot;I Never Found a Girl,&amp;quot; and the soothing blues \neffort &amp;quot;It Ain't No Fun to Me.&amp;quot; The Arkansas native and his \ncreative partner Willie Mitchell season these selections with \nlucid rhythm arrangements complemented by the faint strums\n of a guitar and brawn, unchiding horns.\n\nenjoy and seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a63392ae0a6c9e49eb11c68fd3c1332a38343d","amp;dn":"Al+Green+-+Let%5C%27s+Stay+Together+%28Soul-1972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a63392ae0a6c9e49eb11c68fd3c1332a38343d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,166,51,146,174,10,108,158,73,235,17,198,143,211,193,51,42,56,52,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
