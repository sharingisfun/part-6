Guess the acronym, win a wish!]\n\n---\n\nExcerpt   (see &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer&lt;/a&gt;  for more details):\n\n &quot; [T]he set-up:\n   \n   John Horus, most beloved of [a defunct] team of superhuman streetfighters, has\n   killed the President of the United States for arranging an illegal war. He has a \n   plan, and that plan is even more frightening. He has set himself up as the \n   protector of America. And the authorities cannot take the chance that [his former\n   teammates] are not involved. The country is now at war with its own heroes.\n\n   In a situation like that, there are no sides. Not any more. It's about who \n   survives and who does not. [...]\n\n   It's about where you draw the line. &quot;\n\n---\n\nBrand-new Digital Hi-Res re-releases by Zone-Empire, compiled into one. Bookended with three full(-ish) sets of variants (plus one original collection cover) and the Ellis essay excerpted above, courtesy of a variety of traditional scans.
