Born Alecia Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Pink received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her on-stage to sing a song every Friday.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tRCA\nCatalog:\t\t88725463372\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.88% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Are We All We Are\n02.Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\n03.Try\n04.Just Give Me A Reason (Feat.
