He has been a member of three commercially successful bands: the James Gang, Barnstorm, and the Eagles. He has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician. He holds the 54 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;But Seriously, Folks...&quot; is the fourth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1978 (see 1978 in music). It included the satirical song &quot;Life's Been Good&quot;. The original eight-minute album version of this track was edited down to 4Ã‚Â½ minutes for single release and this became Walsh's biggest solo hit, peaking at #12 on the Billboard chart.\n\nThe album also features the other four members of the EaglesÃ¢â‚¬â€which Walsh had joined two years earlierÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as singer-guitarist Jay Ferguson, a former member of the groups Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne (who co-wrote one track on the album), drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh's former band Barnstorm, and bassist Willie Weeks.\n\nOriginal pressings of this record had text engraved on the carry-out grooves:\n\nSide 1: Luncheon Counter of the Deli Kind\nSide 2: Call It In the Air!\nThe leadout track after Life's Been Good has a recording of &quot;A flock of wah-wahs&quot; which is a minute of gibberish wah-wahs.\n\nWalsh ran a mock campaign for President in 1980; one of the planks of his platform was to make &quot;Life's Been Good&quot; the new national anthem.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a827f8b67eb1a227ad64c5cb61229dfb570c72fb","amp;dn":"Joe+Walsh+-+But+Seriously%2C+Folks...+%5B1978%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a827f8b67eb1a227ad64c5cb61229dfb570c72fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,39,248,182,126,177,162,39,173,100,197,203,97,34,157,251,87,12,114,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
