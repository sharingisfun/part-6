For those that have, you know what I'm talking about. This is the perfect \n\nvsti for creating new sounds. CronoX3 is right up there with Absynth 4, Massive \n\nand FM8. CronoX3 is definitely a must have for making music on your pc. Needs a \n\nhost such as FL Studio.\n\n\nI installed CronoX3 and the bonus presets on Vista machine and used the keygen (in \n\nthe iso) to activate. Very simple install. I scanned all the files with NIS 2008 \n\nand NOD32 AV. ALL CLEAN!\n\n\nThanks to those of you who show your support by seeding this torrent.\n\nThanks to AiRISO for the release of this KILLER vsti!!\n\nPlease take a moment to leave comment.\n\n\n\nXeno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6516bf35d0f6d66f06f0a4ad549c81c3628f89","amp;dn":"LinPlug.CronoX.v3.5.MAC.PC.DVDR-AiRISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6516bf35d0f6d66f06f0a4ad549c81c3628f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,101,22,191,53,208,246,214,111,6,240,164,173,84,156,129,195,98,143,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
