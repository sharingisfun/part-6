Here is a group of youths who are still up for this daring challenge. They all have a single weakness barring them becoming the ultimate top star. The weaknesses wouldn't be an issue or an inconvenience to an ordinary person, but they are detrimental to a pop star. One girl sings superbly but her appearance is not the best to stand before the TV camera. Another student has the looks and musical talent but has a distorted, prejudiced view of the world. There are others who have amazing talent but an unsophisticated fashion sense. Each of these students have managed to pass the exam and enter Kirin Arts High School to begin headlong the challenge of becoming a top superstar. The characters maximize their unique talents and overcome their weaknesses. They fall, trip and fail which only boosts their confidence. The ridicule and scorn they are used to will one day turn into cheers and support. The underdogs and the losers will fly up high and their story will be an inspiration to young viewers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b530b54f0c84e386f86aa0ad62b2b0ed24ef3d9","amp;dn":"Dream+High+Season+1+Episodes+1-16+HD+XviD+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b530b54f0c84e386f86aa0ad62b2b0ed24ef3d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,83,11,84,240,200,78,56,111,134,170,10,214,43,43,14,210,78,243,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
