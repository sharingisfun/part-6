She is joined once again by a number of talented friends and colleagues including Anna Massie, Corrina Hewat and Chris Sherburn.\n\nIn The Shadow of Mountains is a remarkably assured album from an impressive young woman who presents folk songs in the best tradition, not as antiquated museum pieces but as relevant and very human artworks.\n\n&quot;BellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Night Visiting was excellent, but In The Shadow of Mountains is stunning.&quot; Dai Jeffries, R2 Magazine.\n\nThis is an impressive selection of traditional and original songs and tunes, rooted in her home region of the Peak District, but extending far beyond.
