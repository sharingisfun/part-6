It also contains the issues of Green Lantern Corps, Green Lantern Emerald Warriors, Green Lantern New Guardians and Red Lanterns which were written by Dave Gibbons, Peter Tomasi, Tony Bedard and Peter Milligan. Notably artists who contributed to this saga are Ethan Van Sciver, Ivan Reis, Doug Mahnke, Patrick Gleason, Tyler Kirkham, Ed Benes and many others.\n\nI must give credit to CorpusM who's torrent I had downloaded. Everything before the New 52 was compiled and ordered by him. I merely removed the non green lantern related titles from Blackest Night and Brightest Day. I also deleted extra pages not related to the story, such as ads and DC Nation. Everything from the New 52 is compiled and ordered by me. Again I deleted the extra pages in those issues as well.\n\nCredit goes to the original scanners, who scanned these comics and provided them for us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d023f1a394b5a13cc0141df6108804d501e5335","amp;dn":"Geoff+John%27s+Complet+Green+Lantern+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d023f1a394b5a13cc0141df6108804d501e5335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,2,63,26,57,75,90,19,204,1,65,223,97,8,128,77,80,30,83,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
