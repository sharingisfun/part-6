Numerous carefully crafted exercise sets accompanied by clear, crisp exposition give students a firm grasp of basic concepts and take the student from sentential logic through first-order predicate logic, the theory of descriptions, and identity. As the title suggests, this is a book devoted not merely to logic; students will encounter an abundance of philosophy as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae77c003730760af7ddb45ded146199a8d99361","amp;dn":"Logic+and+Philosophy%3A+A+Modern+Introduction%2C+11th+edition+-+Alan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae77c003730760af7ddb45ded146199a8d99361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,231,124,0,55,48,118,10,247,221,180,93,237,20,97,153,168,217,147,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
