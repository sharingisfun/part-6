The season follows the Reds and Blues stranded in a mysterious canyon after a ship that was taking them home crashed. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched by mysterious forces. The season premiered on June 14, 2013, while the rest of the episodes were released on Rooster Teeth's website on Mondays starting June 24, 2013.\n\nThe season returns to a similar format that was used in the Blood Gulch Chronicles, where both teams are in a boxed canyon and do nothing but talk to each other. Also like the first seven seasons of the series, Season 11 featured no pre-rendered character animation sequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dcf9c545be033b529002e8f49f999cb2c9b8755","amp;dn":"Red+Vs+Blue+Season+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dcf9c545be033b529002e8f49f999cb2c9b8755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,207,156,84,91,224,51,181,41,0,46,143,73,249,153,203,44,155,135,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
