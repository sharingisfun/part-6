I also want to add with this torrent (and after me taking a bit of a break) I will no longer be using the h33t tracker because of the issues associated with it. Thanks Politux for his advice on what trackers to use. A big thanks to LD from h33t for 5+ years of a stable, working tracker. \n\n\nKit \n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nSerena Ryder (born December 8, 1982) is a Juno Award-winning Canadian artist.
