This restricted view of happiness works to discourage us from recognizing the upside of any negative life turn and blocks us from recognizing our own growth potential. Our outsized expectations transform natural rites of passage into emotional land mines and steer us to make toxic decisions, as The Myths of Happiness reveals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43865f12e311054ace1a8b8063412b1362f20b44","amp;dn":"The+Myths+of+Happiness%3A+What+Should+Make+You+Happy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43865f12e311054ace1a8b8063412b1362f20b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,134,95,18,227,17,5,74,206,26,139,128,99,65,43,19,98,242,11,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
