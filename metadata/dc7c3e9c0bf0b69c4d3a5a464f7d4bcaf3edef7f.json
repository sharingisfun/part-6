It's a good strong shot of vintage bop, but like so many compilations it suffers slightly from chronologic scrambling. That wouldn't even be worth mentioning were it not for the inclusion of a handful of Bird's early pre-bop recordings. The oldest material, which happens to be the earliest known recording of Charlie Parker, shows up on track 24; &quot;Honeysuckle Rose/Body &amp; Soul&quot; was recorded in Kansas City, KS on May 11, 1940. Placing this chestnut more than one-third of the way into an almost chronological collection is incongruous and will not assist anyone who is trying to savor the man's artistic development over a stated span of thirteen years. That, after all, is what chronologies (and historic jazz collections) are for. The next-to-oldest recordings appear closer to where one would expect them to be -- at the very beginning of the collection. &quot;Swingmatism&quot; and the &quot;Hootie Blues&quot; were recorded for the Decca label in Dallas, TX on April 30, 1941 by Jay McShann &amp; His Orchestra. Something like a chronological progression does manage to materialize, more or less, and when Bird isn't leading his own groups he is heard sitting in with bands led by Red Norvo, Slim Gaillard, and Dizzy Gillespie. While it's very nice to know that these great recordings continue to circulate, it's a damned shame they didn't place the titles in chronological sequence, for Charlie Parker's progress occurred swiftly and very dramatically and there's nothing quite like hearing him evolve, session by session and note by note. \n\n\nTrack Listing - Disc 1\n\t\t\t\n1   Swingmatism  Jay McShann / William Scott  2:43 \t\t\n2   Hootie Blues Walter Brown / Jay McShann / Charlie Parker 2:58 \t\n3   Tiny's Tempo Clyde Hart Charlie Parker 3:01 \t\n4   Groovin' High Dizzy Gillespie 2:44 \t\n5   All the Things You Are  Oscar Hammerstein II / Jerome Kern   2:50 \t\n6   Dizzy Atmosphere  Dizzy Gillespie   2:49 \t\n7   Salt Peanuts  Kenny Clarke / Dizzy Gillespie\t3:18 \t\n8   Shaw 'Nuff  Dizzy Gillespie / Charlie Parker 3:04 \t\n9   Hot House  Tadd Dameron  3:12 \t\n10  Hallelujah  Clifford Grey / Leo Robin / Vincent Youmans 4:02 \t\t\n11  Slam Slam Blues Red Norvo\t4:34 \t\n12  Congo Blues  Red Norvo\t3:57 \t\t\t\n13  Billie's Bounce song review\t3:12 \t\n14  Ko Ko   Charlie Parker\t2:59 \t\n15  Slim's Jam   Slim Gaillard\t3:19 \t\t\n16  Yardbird Suite  Charlie Parker 2:57 \t \t\n17  Ornithology  Charlie Parker\t3:03 \t\n18  A Night in Tunisia  Dizzy Gillespie / Frank Paparelli  3:07 \t \t\n19  The Famous Alto Break  Charlie Parker  0:50 \t\t\n20  Cool Blues  Charlie Parker\t3:07 \t\n21  Bird's Nest  Charlie Parker\t2:47 \t\n22  Relaxin' at Camarillo  Charlie Parker  3:04 \t\n23  Chasin' the Bird  Charlie Parker  2:51 \t\t\n24  Honeysuckle Rose/Body and Soul Frank Eyton / Johnny Green /  Fats Waller  3:45 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7c3e9c0bf0b69c4d3a5a464f7d4bcaf3edef7f","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Retrospective+%281940-53%29+vol.+1+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7c3e9c0bf0b69c4d3a5a464f7d4bcaf3edef7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,124,62,156,11,240,182,156,77,58,90,70,79,125,75,202,243,237,239,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
