A few cassette copies were circulated in the metal underground, and the LP eventually gained a cult status, with many fans going as far to call it &quot;the greatest metal album never officially released.&quot;\n\n&quot;Journey Into Fear&quot; features the distinctive bass playing of bass virtuoso Jean-Pierre Fortin, coupled with great guitar lines by Marc &quot;Hayward&quot; Brassard and Yves &quot;Ian Penn&quot; Pedneault along with classic vocal lines by Michel &quot;Flynn&quot; Lalonde. Combined with way-ahead-of-its-time power drumming by Dan &quot;Mc Gregor&quot; Gregoire, the effort definitely deserves a spot among the greatest heavy metal creations of the '80s.\n\nBased in Quebec, DEAF DEALER started in the early '80s as DEATH DEALER, and made an appearance on the legendary compilation &quot;Metal Massacre IV&quot; in 1983 with the song &quot;Cross My Way&quot;. A short time later, the original singer Andre Larouche was replaced by Lalonde and the band changed its name to DEAF DEALER. They released a highly acclaimed debut in 1986 under the title &quot;Keeper Of The Flame&quot; and in 1987 they recorded eight songs that were never released. Soon after the recordings were completed, the group disbanded.\nCode\nLast Known Line-up:\n\n\n  - J.P.
