Whereas ABBA Gold had pulled together 19 of the group's biggest hits and most familiar songs, Number Ones was a variation on this concept, collecting 18 tracks that were #1 hits in many of the countries where ABBA were successful. In the end, only three tracks from ABBA Gold did not make the cut: &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;, &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot;, and &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot;.  In the UK, the track list included the full length version of &quot;Summer Night City&quot; (originally released on the Thank You for the Music box set) and an additional track &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, oddly never a big hit in that territory..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Gimme!
