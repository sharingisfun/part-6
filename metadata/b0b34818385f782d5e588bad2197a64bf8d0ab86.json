What has caused the downfall of Europe's traditional absolute monarchies and the authority of the Church? Who benefits from the decline of patriotism and traditional religious values? The answer, explicated by the French aristocrat Leon de Poncins, is the forces of Freemasonry and Judaism. I could not find a date of original publication as this is a reprint, but it appears to have been first published in the 1920s. The first part of _Freemasonry and Judaism: Secret Powers Behind Revolution_ discusses the role Freemasonry has played in the revolutionary spirit. Freemasonry is a secret society, with varying levels of involvement for its members, and takes the facade of a philanthropic organization. This is to cover up its ulterior motive, which is to wage an occult war against Christianity and traditionalism in general. The lower echelons of Masonic degrees do not know about the true meaning of Masonry any more than outsiders do, and who the true masterminds are of Masonic intrigue remain a mystery. It appears that Freemasonry is founded on the doctrines of the Jewish Cabala, the precise links lost in antiquity and obscurity. Similar teachings and groups can be traced to ancient times with a continuation of secret organizational structure, occult initiation rituals and symbols. Most of the instigators of the French Revolution were Masons. The Revolution was not a popular uprising against the ruling establishment and the Church as it is commonly believed, but rather planned out by unknown personages in high places who spread propaganda and made it appear that it came from the bottom-up when it was actually from the top-down. The Hexagram (six pointed Star of David) symbolizes the six pronged attack against traditional Christian civilization:\n\n1) Religious (discredit Christianity and promote atheism and rationalism),\n2) Ethical (&quot;corrupt morality of the northern races&quot;),\n3) Aesthetic (&quot;cult of the ugly and aberrant in art&quot;),\n4) Sociological (aristocracy out, plutocracy in, ferment class war),\n5) Industrial and financial (&quot;cartel and trust leading to abolition of private ownership and to state monopoly&quot;, a kind of communism through unbridled capitalism),\n6) Political (&quot;kill patriotism and pride of race&quot;).\n\nThe second part of De Poncins' book outlines the role of Jews and Judaism in revolutionary movements. The Jews have always lived &quot;in exile&quot; throughout the world, always at odds in some form or other with their gentile hosts. Their religion is one that is this messianic, materialist, based on the collective salvation of the group in the world rather than on the individual soul in eternity. Judaism is very community-centered and conservative, but at the same time Jews have spread liberalism, notions of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; to gentiles. If all the other religions and races of the world are confused and lack their own identity, then the most self-centered, ethnocentric group will dominate and perform the best materially and politically. Judaism and its occult creation and ally, Freemasonry, through wars, revolutions, and money manipulation covertly controlled all of Europe by the end of the 19th century. De Poncins notes that the only conservative country left in Europe which posed a threat to Jewish socialism and money power was Russia, with its Czar, landed aristocracy, agricultural economy, the Russian Orthodox Church and lack of democratic institutions. Holy Mother Russia thus was set up to bear the full brunt of Jewish wrath in the Russian Revolution. Several millions were brutally executed and massacred, including all levels of clergy, professionals, the Royal Family and nobility, small landowners and peasants, in the years following the Revolution.\n\nDe Poncins discusses Zionism and what it means to Jewish-gentile relations. The Jews have never been able to maintain their own country on their own (the State of Israel today is subsidized by American military and economic aid) and it appears that the Zionist movement has no intention whatsoever of bringing ALL Jews to Palestine. Zionism, like radical socialism, liberalism and communism, is another political subset in the Jewish plan for world domination, NOT and end in itself. The question is brought up of whether or not this is a conspiracy, along with the accuracy of the _Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion_. The _Protocols_ in and of themselves do not need to be a genuine document because what they state is substantiated by innumerable other sources, a considerable amount of which originate from Jewish authors themselves in addition to various &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; It also appears that this whole thing is not strictly conscious among the Jews, but rather an inborn expression of their racial and religious being. Although international Jewish bankers have the political structures, finance, businesses, and most importantly the media in their hands, De Poncins encourages his readers to stand firm against the revolutionary spirit. Now is not the time for chauvinism, but for cooperation among all elements that serve to promote the traditional scene throughout the world over. One problem that I have with the book is that it does not contain enough of Poncins' actual writing, instead relying mostly on quotations from other sources. However, it does provide an excellent look at how exactly Freemasonry and Judaism act as forces of destruction in the name of &quot;progress.&quot; Oddly enough, the publisher of this reprint is Afrocentric based on the other titles it offers for sale.\n\nOther books by the same author available from yours truly, TalmudTimmy\n\nLe Judaisme et le Vatican - Vicomte Leon, Poncins (soon to be scanned in English) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4328316/Le_Judaisme_et_le_Vatican_-_Vicomte_Leon__Poncins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4328316/Le_Judaisme_et_le_Vatican_-_Vicomte_Leon__Poncins&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIsrael Destructeur d'Empires - LÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°ON DE PONCINS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4351986/Israel_Destructeur_d_Empires_-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4351986/Israel_Destructeur_d_Empires_-&lt;/a&gt;\n_LEON_DE_PONCINS\n\nTHE PROBLEM WITH THE JEWS AT THE COUNCIL - LÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°ON DE PONCINS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4445463/TalmudTimmy_Book_Pack_14-10-08&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4445463/TalmudTimmy_Book_Pack_14-10-08&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                   =$  .
