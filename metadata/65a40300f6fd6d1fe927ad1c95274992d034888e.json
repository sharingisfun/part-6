With the power of C++, you can easily create various types of applications and perform parallelism and optimizations in your existing work. This book is a practical, powerful, and easy-to-understand guide to C++ multithreading. You will learn how to benefit from the multithreaded approach and enhance your development skills to build better applications. This book will not only help you avoid problems when creating parallel code, but also help you to understand synchronization techniques. The end goal of the book will be to impart various multithreading concepts that will enable you to do parallel computing and concurrent programming quickly and efficiently.\nApproach\n\nThe book is an easy-to-follow guide for creating multi-threaded applications using C++. Each topic is thoroughly explained with multiple illustrations. Many algorithms, such as Dinning Philosophers Problem give you thorough explanations that will help you to understand and solve concurrent tasks.\nWho this book is for\n\nThe book is intended for enterprise developers and programmers who wish to make use of C++ capabilities to learn the multithreaded approach. Knowledge of multithreading along with experience in C++ is an added advantage.
