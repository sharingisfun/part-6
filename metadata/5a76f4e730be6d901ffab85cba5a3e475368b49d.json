What Roy doesn't realize is that the satellite is a soul-collecting route to Hell. During an argument one night, Roy and Helen are sucked into a warped version of cable TV - 666 channels of bizarre programs, each designed to collect the souls of Spike's customers. Roy &amp; Helen find themselves caught up in shows such as &quot;You Can't Win&quot; (a game show), &quot;Northern OverExposure&quot;, &quot;Driving Over Miss Daisy&quot; and a cartoon sequence called &quot;RoboCat&quot;, as well as &quot;Duane's Underworld&quot; and &quot;HTV&quot;. When Roy makes it through the trial period without losing his soul, Spike discharges him, but keeps Helen hostage. Now Roy must re-enter this bizarre world of Hell Vision TV if he ever wants to see Helen again.\n\n\nTAGLINE: Everybody wants to be on television. Just not this kind of television. The devil has come for the Knables...before a live studio audience. 666 Channels...and only 24 hours for Roy and Helen to survive. Is it possible??? Something weird's on the air. A comedy adventure on the wrong side of the screen. Most people would love to get into television... Helen and Roy have 24 hours to get out of it.... literally! \n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!! \n\n\nREST IN PEACE  JOHN RITTER  9/17/48 - 9/11/03\n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
