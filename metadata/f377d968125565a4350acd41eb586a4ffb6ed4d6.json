If you already have some of these than feel free to download the ones you need or download the lot. Just remember it is very important to seed back what you take and if possible a little bit more. \n\nAll files are encoded in some form of .avi container, mostly xvid, or divx. All my .mkv, mov, h264, ogm have been re-encoded into xvid so they are compatible with all direct show and network media players e.g. WMP and PS3. These files (very few) may be of increased file size but are of HD quality. All series files are complete and require no further episodes.\n\n\nThis is a very big torrent (50.62gb), I will put all the upload juice I've got into it 24/7 till its done so be patient. \n\nEnjoy people!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f377d968125565a4350acd41eb586a4ffb6ed4d6","amp;dn":"119+Space%2FUniverse+Science+Documentaries+Horizon%2C+Discovery%2C+etc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f377d968125565a4350acd41eb586a4ffb6ed4d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,119,217,104,18,85,101,164,53,10,205,65,235,88,106,79,251,110,212,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
