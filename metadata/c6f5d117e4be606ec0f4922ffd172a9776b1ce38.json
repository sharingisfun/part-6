Guy Howard is one of the few.\nGuy Howard's long experience covers almost every facet of ballroom dancing. Earlier in his career he was a successful competitor and demonstrator. He has taught beginners, medallists, coached competitors and trained teachers. It is teacher training and the study of technique for which he is now famous. This book is the product of his unique experience and brilliant mind.\nFirst published in 1976 the book has been regularly updated to take into account the effects of fashion and the passing of time. This edition is no exception. Over recent years several figures, through usage and popularity, have become an integral part of modern performance. These figures are included in this book with a standardization of technique that will be invaluable to all dancers.\nThe International Dance Teachers' Association and Guy Howard are to be congratulated on the publication of this book. Its demand is world wide.\n\nCONTENTS OF THE BOOK\nForeword 5\nThe Author 6\nIntroduction 7\nChronicle 8\nGeneral Notes and Descriptions of Headings 9\nWaltz Associate Syllabus 16\nStandard Variations 27\nQuickstep Associate Syllabus 45\nStandard Variations 59\nFoxtrot Associate Syllabus 69\nStandard Variations 78\nTango General 98\nAssociate Syllabus 99\nStandard Variations 111\n\nNamed Variations for Fellowship\nWaltz\nQuickstep\nFoxtrot\nTango\nSocial Rhythm\nAdditional Figures\nAmalgamations\nIndex\n\nNOTE:\nThis is a photographed PDF so the quality is not as good as that of a scanned PDF.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f5d117e4be606ec0f4922ffd172a9776b1ce38","amp;dn":"Technique+of+Ballroom+Dancing+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f5d117e4be606ec0f4922ffd172a9776b1ce38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,245,209,23,228,190,96,110,192,244,146,47,253,23,42,151,118,177,206,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
