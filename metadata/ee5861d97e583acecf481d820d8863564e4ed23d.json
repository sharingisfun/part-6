It was the second title in THQ's MotoGP series and based the \n\n2002 MotoGP season. Players could take part in a single race on three choosable circuits (Suzuka, Phakisa, Jerez) or participate in a full season, eventually unlocking more circuits to be \n\nraced on. Also featured in the game is a stunt mode where the player race a one lap performing different stunts as wheelies, burnouts and powerslides for points. Points are also rewarded \n\nwhen overtaking another rider, driving clean sections, or ramming other riders so they crash. However, recently gained points are lost if the player drives outside the track or crashes. Also \n\nif the player fails to reach goal within the timelimit, all rewarded points are lost. The menu theme music is Psynn 2 by Shawn Hargreaves, who created a new version of Psynn, version \n\nused in MotoGP.\n\nDeveloper(s) :- Climax Brighton\nPublisher(s) :- THQ\nPlatform(s) :- Windows\nRelease date(s) :- EU June 20, 2003 (Windows)\nGenre(s) :- Racing\nMode(s) :- Single-player, Multiplayer\n\nSystem Requirements\nOS: Win98 / ME / Windows 2000 / XP / 7\nCPU: 1,6 Ghz Processor\nRAM: 256 Mb\nHDD: 1 GB free space\nGraphics: DirectX compatible\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\nVGA : 64 MB or 128 MB Onboard\nSupported Graphics Cards: GeForce 3 or above\n\nInstall Notes :-\n1.UnRAR the app\n2.Click on setup.bat\n3.Wait\n4.Open game from launcher.exe\n\nAnd Play And Injoy\n\nNote :- UnRAR using 7-Zip/WinRAR/Universal Extractor\n\nRemember Me................................................IGI30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee5861d97e583acecf481d820d8863564e4ed23d","amp;dn":"Mot+2+2003+PC+Game+%7BHighly+Compress%7D+%7BUploaded%7D+%40IGI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee5861d97e583acecf481d820d8863564e4ed23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,88,97,217,126,88,58,206,207,72,29,130,13,136,99,86,78,78,210,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
