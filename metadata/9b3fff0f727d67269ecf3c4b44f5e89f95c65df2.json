Obvious number one classics like &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1960), &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1961), and &quot;Oh Pretty Woman&quot; (1964) are represented alongside his final chart entries and posthumous hits, including the duet version of &quot;Crying&quot; with k.d. Lang (1987), &quot;You Got It&quot; (1989), and &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; (1992). This collection, coupled with Bear Family's Sun Years 1956-58, forms a well-rounded retrospective of Orbison's hauntingly beautiful voice and timeless material.
