Exile on Wall Street is a gripping listen for anyone with an interest in business and finance, U.S. capitalism, the future of banking, and the root causes of the financial meltdown.\n\nAward-winning veteran sell side Wall Street analyst Mike Mayo writes about one of the biggest financial and political issues of our time - the role of finance and banks in the US. He has worked at six Wall Street firms, analyzing banks and protesting against bad practices for two decades. In Exile on Wall Street, Mayo:\n\n    Lays out practices that have diminished capitalism and the banking sector\n    Shares his battle scars from calling truth to power at some of the largest banks in the world and how he survived challenging the status quo to be credited as one of the few who saw the crisis coming\n    Blows the lid off the true inner workings of the big banks and shows the ways in which Wall Street is just as bad today as it was pre-crash\n    Analyzes the fallout stemming from the market crash, pointing out the numerous holes that still exist in the system, and offers practical solutions \n\nWhile it provides an education, this is no textbook. It is an invaluable resource for finance practitioners and citizens alike.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    Audible Audio Edition\n    Listening Length: 6 hours and 37 minutes\n    Program Type: Audiobook\n    Version: Unabridged\n    Publisher: Audible Studios\n    Audible.com Release Date: November 15, 2011\n    Language: English\n    ASIN: B0067VIX00\n\nFile details:\n\n    Format: MP3\n    Channels: 1\n    Bitrate: 64 kbps\n    Sample rate: 44100 Hz\n    Size: 227 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0665d66064bc7f58d73d0f42b318f15a8413d25b","amp;dn":"Mike+Mayo+Exile+on+Wall+Street","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0665d66064bc7f58d73d0f42b318f15a8413d25b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,101,214,96,100,188,127,88,215,61,15,66,179,24,241,90,132,19,210,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
