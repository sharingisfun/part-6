In this short project course, author Kacie Hultgren takes us through the four steps needed to design and ultimately print a replacement part with your 3D printer: sketching your ideas on paper, translating notes into a digital design with a CAD program, testing the print, and then revising and improving on your model. Start now and learn to create replacement parts that are almost as good as the original.\nTopics include:\n\nMeasuring with calipers\nModeling in 3D with Tinkercad\nCreating holes and complex shapes\nPlating and printing\nOptimizing and reworking the design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153f506d37de59dfe73d14b82bf74b72ead6f755","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+3D+Printing+Project%3A+Designing+a+Replacement+Part","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153f506d37de59dfe73d14b82bf74b72ead6f755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,63,80,109,55,222,89,223,231,61,20,184,43,247,75,114,234,214,247,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
