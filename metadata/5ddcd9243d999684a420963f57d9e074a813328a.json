Then renderd the first sharpen, then \r\nnoise reduction and then did a final sharpen\r\n\r\nalso adjusted my previous releases edit after i did the sync and missing parts so that it didnt sound so tinny.\r\n\r\nLondon Has Fallen is on its way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1IBW \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1YFx \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1fNX \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1A2w \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1amL \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1b5p","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddcd9243d999684a420963f57d9e074a813328a","amp;dn":"Deadpool+2016+HD-TS+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddcd9243d999684a420963f57d9e074a813328a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,220,217,36,61,153,150,132,164,32,150,63,87,217,224,116,168,19,50,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
