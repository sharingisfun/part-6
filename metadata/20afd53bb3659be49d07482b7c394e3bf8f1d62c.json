Led by the former NSA agent Miranda Zero, GF is everywhere and nowhere - and it&amp;#039;s mankind&amp;#039;s best defense against everything that occurs outside our peripheral vision. This marvel of brains and machinery is hacked into every satellite, mainframe, cell phone and database across the globe.\n\nWith the help of her central command dispatcher, the feisty but brilliant Aleph, Zero is just a phone call away from tapping anyone anywhere to volunteer their skills to help save the world. GF&amp;#039;s newest &quot;recruit,&quot; suspended cop Sean Flynn, is paired with introverted Kate Finch, a mastermind of the scientific inner workings of the covert network.\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n====\n\nMichelle Forbes ...
