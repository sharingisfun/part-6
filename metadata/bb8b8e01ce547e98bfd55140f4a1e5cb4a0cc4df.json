And on November 22, 2013, the nation remembered the 50th anniversary of one of the most traumatic events in modern American history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  \r\n\r\nFrom day one, the truth behind JFK s assassination has been mired in controversy and dispute.

Corsi, Ph.D., provides readers with the ultimate JFK assassination theory book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8b8e01ce547e98bfd55140f4a1e5cb4a0cc4df","amp;dn":"Jerome+Corsi+-+Who+Really+Killed+Kennedy+-+50+Years+Later+-+Stun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8b8e01ce547e98bfd55140f4a1e5cb4a0cc4df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,139,142,1,206,84,126,152,191,213,81,64,244,161,229,203,74,12,196,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
