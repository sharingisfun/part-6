Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.\n\nWhat is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.\n\nIn A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.\n\nThis is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.\n\n\n\n\nFile Size: 386 KB\nPrint Length: 229 pages\nPublisher: Sarah Crichton Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2007)\nSold by: Macmillan\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B002AWX6UM\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Long-Way-Gone-Memoirs-ebook/dp/B002AWX6UM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Long-Way-Gone-Memoirs-ebook/dp/B002AWX6UM/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTags: race, racism, oppression, africa, african, america, american, african american, black, literature, politics, pan-african, Sierra Leone, dirty war, blood diamond, child soldier, children, 3gw, 4gw, slavery, slave, forced, vnsa, militia, abuse, torture, khat, indoctrination, brainwashing, mineral, resource, proxy war, colonialism, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c7f10001e75efc399477efcdbbea638bd6651e","amp;dn":"A+Long+Way+Gone+Memoirs+of+a+Boy+Soldier+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c7f10001e75efc399477efcdbbea638bd6651e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,199,241,0,1,231,94,252,57,148,119,239,205,187,234,99,139,214,101,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
