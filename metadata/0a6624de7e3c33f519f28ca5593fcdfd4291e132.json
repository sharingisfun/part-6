She takes up the post of governess at Thornfield, falls in love with Mr. Rochester, and discovers the impediment to their lawful marriage, in a story that transcends melodrama to portray a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passionate search for a wider and richer life than Victorian society traditionally allowed.\n\nWith a heroine full of yearning, the dangerous secrets she encounters, and the choices she finally makes, Charlotte BrontÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s innovative and enduring romantic novel continues to engage and provoke readers.\n\n\n*************************\n\n\nProduct details:\n\nAmerican (2010 edition) no Images no Audio\n  epub 661 Kb\n  mobi 968 Kb\n  azw3 1,041 Kb\n\nWith Audio and Images\n  Volume I: epub 6,638 Kb\n  Volume II: epub 5,437 Kb\n  Volume III: epub 5,699 Kb\n  Volume I-III: epub 16,888 Kb\n\nWith Images only\n  epub 8,953 Kb\n  mobi 10,031 Kb\n\nPdf 23,442 Kb\n\n\n*************************\n\nNotes:\n\n1. As some ereader applications have certain abilities I have created various file types of this edition of Jane Eyre. \n\nThe epub files with the audio can be played in ibooks on ipads, and Moonplus Reader for Android.\n\nThe mobi file, contains only the images, as the Kindle applications for various devices, and Mobipocket Reader for PC - at this point in time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sadly, cannot play back the audio.\n\n2. My decision to upload the book in three volumes as well was:\n\n(1) the whole file was getting rather large and was worried about some ereader applicationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to open the file up;\n\n(2) for ease of sending in an email.\n\nThe deciding factor was discovering, in my research about the book and its various editions, that it originally came out as three hard bound volumes, so I split the digital file into three parts so that it reflected the original hard copies.\n\n3. The images and audio tracks, inserted in the ebooks, are from the 11 part 1983 BBC television mini-series, starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, off of a privately owned DVD.\n\n4. Reference material is of a scanned edition, in pdf format, from the University of St. MichaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College, Toronto Library, date stamped 1890, published by W. Nicholson &amp; Sons, Limited (included with this upload, which I used when altering an existing American 2010 digital copy (also contained in upload).\n\n5. Currer Bell, pseudonym for Charlotte Bronte (see Preface contained in ebook).\n\n6. Programs used in the creation and testing of this ebook are as follows:\n\n   Sigil; \n   Adobe; \n   Snagit; \n   Microsoft Word; \n   Calibre, Mobipocket Reader, Kindle and Kindle Previewer for PC; \n   ibooks and Kindle for apple ipads; \n   Aldiko, Moonplus Reader and Kindle for Android Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model).\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a6624de7e3c33f519f28ca5593fcdfd4291e132","amp;dn":"Jane+Eyre+by+Charlotte+Bronte+with+embedded+audio+epub+mobi+azw3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a6624de7e3c33f519f28ca5593fcdfd4291e132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,102,36,222,126,60,51,245,25,242,140,165,89,63,205,253,66,145,225,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
