Blue herself never sees them-not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.\nHis name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.\nBut Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can't entirely explain. He has it all-family money, good looks, devoted friends-but he's looking for much more than that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22fc56b43e73bb91010b49536d8941f03abeefc4","amp;dn":"The+Raven+Boys+-+Maggie+Stiefvater.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22fc56b43e73bb91010b49536d8941f03abeefc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,252,86,180,62,115,187,145,1,11,73,83,109,137,65,240,58,190,239,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
