In this collection of inspiring passages from David R. HawkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, the reader is reminded of the illusory nature of the personal self (identification of the ego/mind) and the direct pathways to dissolve the ego/mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trappings. This pocket edition is designed especially for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual student on the go, to inspire contemplation and reflection during a break at work, while hiking in the woods, during a quiet coffee-shop moment, on an airplane, with a partnerÃ¢â‚¬â€in whatever environment one finds oneself. Dissolving the Ego, Realizing the Self is a reliable companion on the aspirantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest toward higher truth.
