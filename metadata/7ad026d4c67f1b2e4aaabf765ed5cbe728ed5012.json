After installation go to installation directory. The default is C:Peshka . Go to C:PeshkaLocalApplicationDataCourses. Those who already have Peshka installed will find all their course files in this directory. First you need download our package and extract it to the above folder. For example, the folder name for a course is &quot;openings_tactics_eng&quot;. Now in C:PeshkaLocalApplicationDataCourses you will find a file called &quot;Courses.xml&quot;. This file serves the purpose of listing and indexing all your peshka courses. Open this file with notepad/wordpad. You will see something like this:\n\n?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?\ncourses current=&quot;0&quot;\n&lt;course id=&quot;334&quot; caption=&quot;Mikhail Botvinnik&quot; description=&quot;The most complete collection of BotvinnikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s games ever compiled.

The above code contains only one course named &quot;Play like Mikhail Botvinnik&quot;. Every course starts with &quot;course id=&quot;xxx&quot;..&quot; and ends with the closing tag &quot;/course&quot;. Now scroll down to the last closing tag and paste the following piece of code after /course- paste the following additional info for the new course\n\n&lt;course id=&quot;371&quot; caption=&quot;Chess Tactics in Open games&quot; description=&quot;This course is aimed at the club and intermediate players and presents the theory and playing hooks in Open Games, appearing after moves 1. e4 e5 2.

Now Open Peshka and under the &quot;Courses&quot; tab you will find this new course.\n\nApparently, management of Peshka courses can be accomplished without needing manual editing of any XML file. Certain findings are placed below, for sharing with members of this forum (based upon Peshka 3.0.2 on Win XP system):\nIt is observed that Peshka course details are held at two locations:\n1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peshka program installation directory - sample path:\nC:Program FilesCHESSPeshkaLocalApplicationDataCourses\n2 - Documents and Settings directory - sample path:\nC:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataPeshkaCourses\nNote Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Depending upon the system installation, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Documents and SettingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ folder can have more than one subfolders (apart from Ã¢â‚¬Å“All UsersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), each having its own Ã¢â‚¬Å“Application DataÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. You should ascertain as to which one holds PeshkaCourses. That would constitute path (2) mentioned above.\nCourses folder in item (2) above gets populated programmatically, when Peshka is run, based upon contents of Courses folder in program installation directory. It also contains a file named ServerCourses.xml.\nContents built up in Courses folder in (2) above, remain intact, even if those of its counterpart (i.e. Courses folder in program installation directory) are subsequently removed (e.g. even if the folder is made completely empty - Peshka will continue to do fine, exposing all the courses loaded so far).\nLet us examine the situation arising after fresh installation of Peshka program, while some stored Peshka courses are also available separately. It would be desirable to use an exclusive folder say Ã¢â‚¬Å“PeshkaCourseLibraryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and place it in a directory other than Ã¢â‚¬Å“Program FilesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Documents and SettingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as existing contents of these two are liable to get lost if, for some reason, re-installation of operating system becomes necessary. Simultaneously, as an abundant precaution, a back up copy can be stored in an external device.\nStep 1:\nIf it is desired to start with a clean slate, free of the demo courses accompanying the free Peshka program package, delete the contents of Courses folders in (1) and (2) above Ã¢â‚¬â€œ other than file Ã¢â‚¬Å“ServerCourses.xmlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in (2) above. Before doing so, make sure that Peshka program is closed.\nStep 2:\nFrom Ã¢â‚¬Å“PeshkaCourseLibraryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, copy the first course bundle to Courses folder in (1) above (peshka installation directory). Each course bundle is typically made up of one or more course folders plus one cover file named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Courses.xmlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Each course folder contains three files carrying the course name (same as folder name), with extensions .czd, czh and .xml respectively.\nStep 3:\nRun Peshka. Close Peshka. It would be found that the Courses folder in (2) above (Documents and Settings) has been populated with appropriate course folders as well as Courses.xml file.\nNote Ã¢â‚¬â€œ When you run Peshka after very first course installation subsequent to a clean slate, Peshka Wizard will come up. Click Ã¢â‚¬Å“Show Courses ListÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, select the desired course in course browser and press enter.\nStep 4:\nFor adding more courses, close Peshka. Delete existing contents of Courses folder in (1) above (peshka installation directory) and perform step 2 above, copying the desired course bundle from Ã¢â‚¬Å“PeshkaCourseLibraryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Perform step 3 above. . It would be found that the Courses folder in (2) above (Documents and Settings) has been augmented with the additional course folders. Simultaneously, Courses.xml file in this folder gets updated automatically, reflecting the expanded range of courses. XML blocks for the freshly added courses get inserted suitably in this file.\nNote Ã¢â‚¬â€œ While following the above steps, if there is any overlap in the course bundle meant to be freshly added (i.e. some of the courses in this bundle have already been loaded earlier), only the courses not already loaded, will get added. Similarly, XML blocks in Courses.xml file in (2) above will get added only if not already existing.\nIMP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ After loading of all available courses has been completed, it would be advisable to take a back up of Courses folder in (2) above (i.e. in Documents and Settings directory) to a suitable location (other than in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Program FilesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Documents and SettingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). This way, in future, if faced with any contingency (e.g. re-installation of operating system), the complete bundle covering all the courses can be re-loaded at one go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ following the steps outlined above.\nCaution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In routine working with Peshka, the course browser (activated by clicking Ã¢â‚¬Å“CoursesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the tool bar) can sometimes get positioned in such a manner that its Ã¢â‚¬Å“OKÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“CancelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ buttons at bottom are not in view, unless it is dragged upwards. Before undertaking any other activity, this browser needs to be dismissed, either by selecting a course and pressing Enter key (or clicking OK) or by clicking cancel button. Otherwise the user could get a false impression that the application is frozen.\n\n1. opening blunders 1-7\n2. encyclopedia of middlegame 1-5\n3. Ct- Art 1-2-3\n4.
