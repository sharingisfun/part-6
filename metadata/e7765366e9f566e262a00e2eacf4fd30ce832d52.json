My friend gesserit had me thinking about Robertson's art yesterday. And then also I had realized that no one had compiled the complete '12-'13 series into one torrent yet.\n\nSo in this torrent you will find:\n\n1. FURY 01-06 (2001-2002 miniseries, Marvel MAX imprint, by Garth Ennis, Darick Robertson &amp; Jimmy Palmiotti)\n\n2. FURY - PEACEMAKER 01-06 (2006 miniseries, Marvel Knights imprint, by Ennis, Robertson &amp; Palmiotti)\n\n3. FURY 01-13 (2012-2013 series, Marvel MAX imprint, by Garth Ennis &amp; Goran Parlov)\n\n**Reading order: You can go by the publishing order, or chronologically: the 2nd is set in Nick's World War II days; the 3rd in the 1960s; and the 1st in the 2000s.\n\nThe first is my personal favorite, because it's unabashedly critical of the corporate mentality of both the U.S. government and the United Nations at the turn of the millenium. And also 'cause its existence made Stan Lee uncomfortable. LOL!\n\nTechnically, my torrent's title is misleading... Peacemaker wasn't a MAX title... but in the words of a great character, Don't Fuck With Wendel!\n\nSorry, no preview image. Bayimg doesn't like me. The 1st series had really cool Bill Sienkiewicz covers. You can see all the covers here if need be:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury/4050-9108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury/4050-9108/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury-peacemaker/4050-18538/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury-peacemaker/4050-18538/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury-max/4050-48584/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/fury-max/4050-48584/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed and share!  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7765366e9f566e262a00e2eacf4fd30ce832d52","amp;dn":"Fury+MAX+Complete+%282001-2013%29+%28Garth+Ennis%2C+Robertson%2C+Parlov%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7765366e9f566e262a00e2eacf4fd30ce832d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,118,83,102,233,245,102,226,98,160,14,46,172,244,253,48,206,131,45,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
