One of the most unusual, intoxicating albums in the John Coltrane discography. He's not aggressive, and he's not outwardly. Instead he's introspective and at times even predictable, but that is precisely Ballads' draw.\n The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ballads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Deluxe EditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features the entire output from sessions in December of 1961, and in September and November of 1962. The first CD presents the original album in all its luminous glory, the second CD presents supplementary material from the original sessions as well as material that has only recently come to light. The classic quartet's collective concentration shows in seven complete takes of &quot;It's Easy to RememberÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. There are also several takes of the airy &quot;Greensleeves&quot; and a limpidly beautiful version of &quot;They Say It's Wonderful&quot; with Coltrane in duet with pianist McCoy Tyner. \n\n\n\n John Coltrane Quartet\n\n Ballads\n\n 1962\n\n Deluxe Edition\n\n \n  2CDs / 2002 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n \n\nTracklist / CD 1 / The Original Album:\n\n 1.
