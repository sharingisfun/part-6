Through the many interesting projects you can build in this book, you'll build your HTML5 skills for your future projects, and extend the core skills you may have learned with its companion book, The Essential Guide to HTML5.\n\nHTML5 and JavaScript Projects covers the most important areas of HTML5 that you'll want to know how to program, including: video, and audio, databases, localStorage, and geolocation. The projects have been carefully selected to help you build your HTML5 and JavaScript programming skills. You'll build games and applications, such as video jigsaws,  recipe archives, paper dolls, and many more captivating examples.\n\nEach project starts out with an introduction to the basic HTML5 and JavaScript concepts covered and then includes specific, appealing examples explained step-by-step. You'll also discover line-by-line explanations for every single line of codeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½we'll make sure that you can fully understand what each line of code does, so that you can easily take that understanding and apply it to your own HTML5 projects.\n\nHTML5 and JavaScript Projects:\n\n    * Shows how to produce applications combining Canvas drawings, photos, and videos\n    * Explains how to incorporate Google Maps and geolocation into your projects\n    * Reveals how to build applications requiring persistent data, storing the information locally or on a database on the server\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\n    * How to create line drawings using mathematical operations for defining coordinate positions\n    * How to incorporate Google Maps and geolocation to determine the location of the user\n    * How to use locations as triggers for playing videos using JavaScript\n    * How to combine the canvas with geolocation maps using HTML5 and JavaScript\n    * Use HTML5 Audio for event sounds and background music\n    * How to manipulate, store and retrieve complex information using localStorage\n    * How to build applications involving JavaScript and the HTML5 APIs\n\nWho this book is for\n\nHTML5 and JavaScript Projects is for the developer who wants and needs to move to the next level of Web development, including more sophisticated programming and the design and construction of sets of applications. This book targets people who want to go beyond the basics of HTML5 and, for example, incorporate maps using the Google Maps API into their work or build projects that require persistent data on the client computer (localStorage). The book will be helpful for people working in teams, where considerable effort is required to create, access and manage information.\nTable of Contents\n\n   1.
