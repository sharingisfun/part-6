In 1261, however, the Byzantine general Michael VIII Palaiologos triumphantly re-entered Constantinople and reclaimed the seat of the empire, initiating a resurgence of art and culture that would continue for nearly three hundred years, not only in the waning empire itself but also among rival Eastern Christian nations eager to assume its legacy. Byzantium: Faith and Power (1261Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1557), and the groundbreaking exhibition that it accompanies, explores the artistic and cultural flowering of the last centuries of the &quot;Empire of the Romans&quot; and its enduring heritage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793737feb31e59587698864c551da6bb9d7dc9e0","amp;dn":"Byzantium+-+Faith+and+Power+1261-1557+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793737feb31e59587698864c551da6bb9d7dc9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,55,55,254,179,30,89,88,118,152,134,76,85,29,166,187,157,125,201,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
