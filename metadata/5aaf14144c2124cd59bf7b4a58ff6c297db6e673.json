The show is \nbroadcast on truTV, narrated by Peter Thomas, and produced by \nMedstar Television, in association with truTV Original \nProductions. It has broadcast over 300 episodes so far since \nits debut on TLC in 1996 as Medical Detectives.\n\nThe show helped pioneer documentary style crime-science shows.\nThe show's official web site says it profiles &quot;puzzling, often\nbaffling cases whose riddles are ultimately solved by forensic\ndetection.&quot; The cases and people are real. Perhaps \nsurprisingly, DNA testing is rarely focused on. While \nballistics, hair analysis, and fingerprint comparisons do turn\nup, the show seems to prefer unusual evidence such as animal \nhairs, plant analysis, or arson investigation. Scientists and \nforensic experts in many fields are interviewed.\n\nNot every case is a crime. In some cases, the investigation \nreveals that suspects are innocent, and the death was an \naccident or suicide. Several shows have profiled people who \nhave been jailed for or convicted of a crime, and who were \nultimately exonerated by forensic evidence.\n\nHelp keep this crime documentary alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aaf14144c2124cd59bf7b4a58ff6c297db6e673","amp;dn":"Forensic+Files+Documentary+Television+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aaf14144c2124cd59bf7b4a58ff6c297db6e673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,175,20,20,76,33,36,205,89,191,123,74,88,255,108,41,125,182,230,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
