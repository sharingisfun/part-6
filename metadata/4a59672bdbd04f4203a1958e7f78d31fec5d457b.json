It all includes all thansitions, titles and menus that I could find.  \n\nThe problem I noticed is that after I install Pinnacle and crack it, I started the application and it worked great but there were only a few transitions and menus to choose from.  I looke and all of the keys were good.  Problem is that you need to install the premium packs.  They can come from version 10,11 and 12.  This is how you do it.\n\n1)  Mount pinnacle studio 12 \n2)  Install pinnacle studio 12 and crack it (crack is built in to a menu)\n3)  Check and make sure it works\n\ndo the following step to each premium pack:\n\n** make sure pinnacle studio is not running!**\n\n1)  mount the premium pack\n2)  go to Start/program/Pinnacle Studio 12/Tools/Transfer Content\n3)  choose &quot;yes&quot;  then version 10\n4)  it will say preparing computer...wait...\n5)  now install the premium pack (if this do not work try step 4 again and choose version 11)\n6)  go back to Start/program/Pinnacle Studio 12/Tools/Transfer Content\n7)  IT will now say found content and transfer the content\n8) new content is ready to use!\n\nstart over with step 1-7 for each pack!
