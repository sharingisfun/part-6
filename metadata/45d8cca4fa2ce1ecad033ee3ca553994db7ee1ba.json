Analytical and experimental methods are employed to identify failures and quantify operating conditions and efficiency of gas turbines. Gas turbine engine defect diagnostic and condition monitoring systems, operating conditions of open gas turbines, reduction of jet mixing noise, recovery of exhaust heat from gas turbines, appropriate materials and coatings, ultra micro gas turbines and applications of gas turbines are discussed. The open exchange of scientific results and ideas will hopefully lead to improved reliability of gas turbines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45d8cca4fa2ce1ecad033ee3ca553994db7ee1ba","amp;dn":"Efficiency%2C+Performance+and+Robustness+of+Gas+Turbines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45d8cca4fa2ce1ecad033ee3ca553994db7ee1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,216,204,164,250,44,225,236,173,3,62,227,202,85,57,148,219,126,225,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
