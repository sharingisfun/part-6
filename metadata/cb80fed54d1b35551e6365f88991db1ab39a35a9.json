And from this safe distance, the Committee enforces its despotic rule. There are too many people and too few resources, and they need 12 billion to die before Earth can be stabilised. So corruption is rife, people starve, and the poor are policed by mechanised overseers and identity-reader guns. Citizens already fear the brutal Inspectorate with its pain inducers. But to reach its goals, the Committee will unleash satellite laser weaponry, taking carnage to a new level.\n\nThis is the world Alan Saul wakes to, travelling in a crate destined for the Calais incinerator. How he got there he doesn't know, butt he remembers pain and his tormentor's face. He also has company: Janus, a rogue intelligence inhabiting forbidden hardware in his skull. As Janus shows Saul an Earth stripped of hope, he resolves to annihilate the Committee and their regime... once he's discovered who he was, and killed his interrogator","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb80fed54d1b35551e6365f88991db1ab39a35a9","amp;dn":"Neal+Asher+-+The+Departure+%28Owner+Trilogy+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb80fed54d1b35551e6365f88991db1ab39a35a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,128,254,213,77,27,53,85,30,99,101,248,137,145,219,26,179,154,53,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
