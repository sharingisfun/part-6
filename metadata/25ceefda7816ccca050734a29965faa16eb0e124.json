By the early 1970s, he had dropped the &quot;System&quot; from his recordings, and he continued to strive for national success with other various bands. In 1973 he put together &quot;The Silver Bullet Band,&quot; an evolving group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful. In 1976, he achieved national fame with two albums, the live record Live Bullet, and the studio record Night Moves. On his studio albums he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, appearing on several of Seger's best selling singles and albums. \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band - Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\nRipper...............: dBpoweramp   (Secure mode) &amp; \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Standard, (avg. bitrate: 201kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: Bubanee\nPosted by............:  on 1/20/2011\nNews Server..........:\nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO - Cov\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
