Ant comments on Ellenâ€™s appearance, a crazy episode of Dr. Phil, reminisces on â€œsadâ€ episodes of Maury Povich, and Artie Lange comes in and the guys go on to chat about freedom of speech, Colin Kaepernick, Burt Reynolds bhole, Catholic policies, and staying away from certain words. Artie tells a throwback gambling story, they talk about the ease of Uber, getting out of tickets, Artie tells the best cop story ever, they chat about Bill and Hillary, Maryjean takes a seat and they go on to discuss bush of all kind, chicks looking great from afar, Maryjeanâ€™s salon Lyon Beauty Salon, and we see a clip of Maryjean cutting Artieâ€™s hair five years ago. The trio also discusses relaxing haircuts, their Garrett drawn pics, â€œMy Pillow,â€ Jublia, Howard Stern stories, and drug stigmas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d03279f7def047e058528dd17b07cdab99c7d96","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-09-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d03279f7def047e058528dd17b07cdab99c7d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,3,39,159,125,239,4,126,5,133,40,221,23,176,124,218,185,156,125,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
