It is further development of Generic Safedisc emulator and incorporates all its features. This program allows running Backup Copies of SafeDisc (C-Dilla), Securom, Laserlock, CDCOPS, StarForce and Protect CD (and many others) protected games. Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive (Generic DVD-ROM) enabling you to use your CD images as if they were already burned to CD! DAEMON Tools works under Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with all types of CD/DVDROM drives (IDE/SCSI) and supports nearly any CD protection.\n\nDAEMON Tools needs a 1:1 Copy to run!! \nDAEMON Tools is used to RUN GAMES, NOT TO BURN THEM!!! Means emulation must be active while you want to play a game, not while burning the copy (except for you want to use DAEMON Tools' &amp;quot;fastdump&amp;quot; feature on a safedisc protected CD). \nIf you want to run a copy protected application from an image mounted to a Generic DVD-ROM enabling the copy protection emulation(s) is NOT necessary!! \nGeneric DVD-ROM is able to run nearly every protected or unprotected CD image (SafediscÃ‚Â®, SecuromÃ‚Â®, LaserlockÃ‚Â®, LockblocksÃ‚Â® etc.) like it was the original CD! Just do an image file using one of the supported burning programs and mount it with Daemon Manager! \nDAEMON Tools supports the following image files:\n\ncue/bin \niso \nccd (CloneCD) \nbwt (Blindwrite) \nmds (Media Descriptor File) \ncdi (Discjuggler) \nnrg (Nero) \npdi (Instant CD/DVD) \nb5t (BlindWrite 5) \n\n\nPlease Enjoy\nSeeded By OA-Mainstream(LateOland#004)\n(want to join us??)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cd8a05a093cbbaf6fd0ccfda584e5ddaba6e9e0","amp;dn":"Deamon+Tools+whit+All+Language+Support","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cd8a05a093cbbaf6fd0ccfda584e5ddaba6e9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,216,160,90,9,60,187,175,111,208,204,253,165,132,229,221,171,166,233,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
