Set in 19 ABY, the two books explore the end of the Galactic Civil War. While some forces in the Imperial Remnant, led by Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, attempt to make peace with the New Republic, another group, led by Moff Disra and an apparently resurrected Grand Admiral Thrawn, attempts to destabalize the New Republic. They do this by bringing to light the Caamas Document, containing evidence that the Bothans were guilty of helping Emperor Palpatine all but exterminate the Caamasi people. Meanwhile, Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker investigate a mysterious fortress at the edge of the galaxy. \n\nfinally unabridged versions \nruntime : 14:27:43 and 26:13:55 \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Specter_of_the_Past&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Specter_of_the_Past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Vision_of_the_Future&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Vision_of_the_Future&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a681fb42097f01233f67bc7d76bd80b4b069cf96","amp;dn":"Timothy+Zahn+-+Star+Wars+-+The+Hand+of+Thrawn+Duology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a681fb42097f01233f67bc7d76bd80b4b069cf96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,129,251,66,9,127,1,35,63,103,188,125,118,189,128,180,176,105,207,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
