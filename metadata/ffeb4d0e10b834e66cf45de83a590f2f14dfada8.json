I found this as two mp4 files but because the second part was hard to find I decided to join them into one file and share. Since avi container has wider support than mp4 I thought it's better to use avi.\n\nHope you'll enjoy it. \n\nTechnical details: \nI kept the same quality settings:\nVideo: 720 x 480, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, 29.970, 2000 kbps\nAudio: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz,  160 kb/s tot , Stereo\nLength: 2:38:14 hrs\nFrame rate: 29.970\n\nPS. I'm looking for the following, if anyone has it please share:\n- Tony Sweet's Visual Literacy: Photography Workshop\n- HDR (High Dynamic Range) Photography Made Easy\n- Digital SLR Photography, Show Me How Videos\nOr any other good video photography guides\n\n\nAbout this video: \n(Source: http:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffeb4d0e10b834e66cf45de83a590f2f14dfada8","amp;dn":"Nikon+School+-+Guide+to+Creative+Lighting+-+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffeb4d0e10b834e66cf45de83a590f2f14dfada8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,235,77,14,16,184,52,230,108,244,93,232,58,89,15,47,20,223,173,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
