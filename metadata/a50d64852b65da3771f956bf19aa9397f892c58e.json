A year and a half in the making, 'An Announcement To Answer' marks the next step in the evolution of Quantic's sound - broadening his musical palette whilst still delivering the trademark funky grooves that have made him a sure-fire floor-filler for DJs worldwide.\nInspired and educated (as opposed to influenced) by the records he discovered whilst travelling and working in Puerto Rico, Nigeria, Benin, Ghana and Ethiopia, Quantic has fused the traditional sounds of these countries with hip hop, soul, funk and jazz to produce his own potent musical brew.\nMuch of the album was written and recorded on a laptop in various locations around the world - including Puerto Rico and the Candela studios in San Juan - during an extended period of international gigging and crate-digging. Experimenting with new techniques and collaborating with the talented people he met during his travels has endowed Quantic's music with a greater depth, intricacy and level of sophistication than ever before.\nGuest artists on the album include Noelle Scaggs from The Rebirth, Ohmega Watts and Puerto Rican percussionist Tempo, who has previously worked with Roberto Roena of the legendary Fania All Stars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50d64852b65da3771f956bf19aa9397f892c58e","amp;dn":"Quantic+-+An+Announcement+To+Answer+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50d64852b65da3771f956bf19aa9397f892c58e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,13,100,133,43,101,218,55,113,249,86,191,25,170,147,151,248,146,197,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
