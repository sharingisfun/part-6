It consisted of ex-Soundgarden frontman and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and the former instrumentalists of Rage Against the Machine: Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass and backing vocals) and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, noted that it had established a separate identity.\n\nThe band's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s grunge. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into this mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums and vocals; no samples were ever used.\n\nAfter Audioslave released three successful albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba, Cornell issued a statement in February 2007 that he was permanently leaving the band &quot;due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences&quot;. As the other three members were busy with the Rage Against the Machine reunion, and Morello and Cornell had each released solo albums in 2007, Audioslave was officially disbanded.\n\nAlbums:\n\nAudioslave (2002)\nOut of Exile (2005)\nRevelations (2006)\n\n\nLine-up:\n   * Tim Commerford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n   * Chris Cornell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals\n   * Tom Morello ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\n   * Brad Wilk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\nMore info at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioslave_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioslave_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ffe403c261d55f38aa1d635a7120993cc885d6","amp;dn":"Audioslave+-+Discography+%282002-2006%29+%5BAPE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ffe403c261d55f38aa1d635a7120993cc885d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,255,228,3,194,97,213,95,56,170,29,99,90,113,32,153,60,200,133,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
