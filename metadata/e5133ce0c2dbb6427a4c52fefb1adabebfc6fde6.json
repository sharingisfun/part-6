The duo consists of producer Andy Barlow, who also produces under the pseudonym Hipoptimist, and singer-songwriter Lou Rhodes. They achieved commercial success with two hit singles &quot;GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³recki&quot; and &quot;Gabriel&quot;.\n\nAndy Barlow stated during their 3 January 2010 show at The Tivoli in Brisbane Australia, their 32nd gig of what was supposed to be only 7, that it would be their &quot;last gig ever, but who knows&quot;. Barlow later followed up on Lambs Facebook fan page on 7 January, &quot;I have a strong feeling that there will be more Lamb shows, It doesn't seem like it has reached its finale just yet&quot;.[5]\n\nIn December 2010, another e-mail was sent out, announcing the recording of their fifth album, to be titled &quot;5&quot;, and a selection of songs from the album were previewed at Playground Weekender music festival near Sydney, Australia on 20 February.\n\n**Limited edition &quot;pre-order&quot; version of the album - available to fans who paid in advance as a method of crowd-sourcing the finance to produce the album.**\n\n\nFrom Wiki and Discogs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Lamb-5/release/2853128&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Lamb-5/release/2853128&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lambofficial.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lambofficial.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n___________________________________Tracks________________________________________\n\nDisc I\n\n1-1 \t\tAnother Language \t           4:19 \t\n1-2 \t\tButterfly Effect \t           3:44 \t\n1-3 \t\tBuild A Fire                       3:43 \t\n1-4 \t\tWise Enough \t                   4:47 \t\n1-5 \t\tExistential Itch \t           2:23 \t\n1-6 \t\tStrong The Root \t           3:52 \t\n1-7 \t\tRounds                             4:13 \t\n1-8 \t\tShe Walks \t                   3:07 \t\n1-9 \t\tLast Night In The Sky \t           3:42 \t\n1-10 \t\tThe Spectacle                      4:00 \n\nDisc II\n\t\n2-1 \t\tDischord                           2:26 \t\n2-2 \t\tBack To Beginning                  3:20 \t\n2-3 \t\tStrong The Root (Instrumental) \t   3:42 \t\n2-4 \t\tLast Night The Sky (Instrumental)  3:26 \t\n2-5 \t\tRounds (Demo) \t                   3:15 \t\n2-6 \t\tButterfly Effect (Instrumental)    3:47 \t\n2-7 \t\tStrong The Root (Acapella) \t   3:30 \t\n2-8 \t\tWise Enough (Instrumental) \t   4:33 \t\n2-9 \t\tThe Spectacle (Reprise) \t   3:14\n\n_________________________________Track Info________________________________________\n\n\n\n                               mp3 VBR (avg. 200 kbps)\n\n                               44.1 kHz\n                           \n   \nI take absolutely no credit for the ripping, encoding and uploading of this track onto the internet.
