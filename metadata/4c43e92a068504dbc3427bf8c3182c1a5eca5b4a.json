He was the lead singer for the Matthew Good Band, one of Canada's most successful alternative rock bands in the 1990s, before dissolving the band in 2002. Other band members included drummer Ian Browne, guitarist/keyboardist Dave Genn, and original bassist Geoff Lloyd, later replaced by Rich Priske. In the years since the Matthew Good Band's disbanding, Good has pursued a solo career and established himself as a political activist and blogger. \n\n\n\n\n\nLast of the Ghetto Astronauts 1995\n\n\nLast of the Ghetto Astronauts was the debut album of the Matthew Good Band. It was released independently in 1995 on a budget of roughly $5,000 CAD. With the singles &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot;, &quot;Symbolistic White Walls&quot;, the album achieved incredible popularity, particularly in western Canada. It gained the title of highest-selling independent album in Canada, a title it holds to this day.\n\nThe band was originally going to go with another name (&quot;Snowaxe&quot; and &quot;Gandalf&quot; have been mentioned by Matthew Good), however a radio station in Vancouver played &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; and announced the band as the Matthew Good Band, at which point it stuck.\n\nLast of the Ghetto Astronauts has two album covers: the original, independent cover, with cursive writing along the bottom and the band name featured prominently, and the subsequent production company release, which uses block letters and a different text layout. Both albums have the same pictures.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; - 3:18 (Good, Lloyd, Browne)\n2.\t&quot;Symbolistic White Walls&quot; - 4:30\n3.\t&quot;She's Got a New Disguise&quot; - 6:17\n4.\t&quot;Native Son&quot; - 4:52\n5.\t&quot;Vermilion&quot; - 4:49\n6.\t&quot;Every Name Is My Name&quot; - 4:00\n7.\t&quot;Haven't Slept in Years&quot; - 3:23\n8.\t&quot;Radio Bomb&quot; - 3:09\n9.\t&quot;Fearless&quot; - 5:15\n10.\t&quot;The War Is Over&quot; - 7:56 / &quot;Omissions of the Omen&quot; - 4:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaygun 1996\n\n\nRaygun was a five-song EP released by the Matthew Good Band in 1996 as a followup to their enormously popular indie release, Last of the Ghetto Astronauts. Distributed by A&amp;M Records on Matthew Good's own imprint, Darktown, it was the first MGB album to include guitarist Dave Genn as a member of the band proper. The EP includes a newly-recorded version of Haven't Slept In Years; it is not the original version found on Last of the Ghetto Astronauts.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Raygun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n2.\t&quot;Generation X-Wing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32 (Good, Genn)\n3.\t&quot;Haven't Slept In Years (Alternate)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n4.\t&quot;Alabama Motel Room (Alternate)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 (Good, Lloyd, Browne)\n5.\t&quot;So Long Mrs. Smith&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderdogs 1997\n\n\nUnderdogs is the second full-length album released by the Matthew Good Band in 1997, as a follow-up to the 1995 album Last of the Ghetto Astronauts. The album was the band's most successful album yet, reaching platinum sales in Canada and being nominated for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; at the 1999 Juno Awards.\n\nIn a 2000 poll by music magazine Chart, Underdogs was voted the 18th Greatest Canadian album of all time.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Deep Six&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n2.\t&quot;Everything Is Automatic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n3.\t&quot;Apparitions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n4.\t&quot;My Out Of Style Is Coming Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n5.\t&quot;Strangest One of All&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n6.\t&quot;Middle Class Gangsters&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n7.\t&quot;Rico&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26 (Good, Genn, Lloyd, Browne)\n8.\t&quot;Prime Time Deliverance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33 (Good)\n9.\t&quot;The Inescapable Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 (Good)\n10.\t&quot;Indestructible&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n11.\t&quot;Invasion 1&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n12.\t&quot;Look Happy, It's The End Of The World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n13.\t&quot;Change Of Season&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Midnight  1999\n\n\nBeautiful Midnight is the third album released by the Matthew Good Band and the follow-up to the band's 1997 album, Underdogs. Beautiful Midnight debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart,[1] selling approximately 25,000 copies in its first week.[2] It would go on to become the band's most successful album, being certified Platinum in Canada two months after its release and 2x Platinum on September 7, 2000.\n\nThe album produced four successful singles and music videos, &quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot;, &quot;Load Me Up&quot;, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, and &quot;The Future is X-Rated&quot;. The success of Beautiful Midnight propelled Good to a celebrity status in Canada he eventually grew to loathe, and his interactions with the media throughout the promotional cycle for the record were often strained and unpleasant. The album was re-released in 2001 in the United States on Atlantic Records with an altered tracklisting with remixed songs from Underdogs. Good has referred to it as something of a greatest hits. The album did not achieve the kind of success in America as it did in Canada due to Good intentionally sabotaging the band's career stateside by refusing to play along with the media and music industry in the country and the band's reluctance to commit extensively touring the country.\n\nA number of songs considered for inclusion on Beautiful Midnight were relegated to b-side or unreleased status. &quot;Flashdance II&quot; was eventually released on Loser Anthems, while &quot;Pony Boy&quot;, which was recorded for the subsequent album The Audio of Being, remained unreleased until In a Coma in 2005.\n\nThere is also an unrelated power chord rock group of the same name as this album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Giant&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:10\n2.\t&quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n3.\t&quot;Strange Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n4.\t&quot;I Miss New Wave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n5.\t&quot;Load Me Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 (Good, Genn, Priske, Browne)\n6.\t&quot;Failing the Rorschach Test&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n7.\t&quot;Suburbia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n8.\t&quot;LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Get It On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n9.\t&quot;Jenni's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n10.\t&quot;Going All The Way&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n11.\t&quot;A Boy and His Machine Gun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n12.\t&quot;The Future Is X-Rated&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n13.\t&quot;Born to Kill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n14.\t&quot;Running for Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Audio Of Being 2001\n\n\nThe Audio Of Being was an album released by the Canadian rock group Matthew Good Band in 2001. It was the last release from MGB and included the two singles &quot;Carmelina&quot; and &quot;Anti-Pop&quot;. The album was certified Gold on March 14, 2003.\n\nThe recording of this album was reported to be very stressful for all members of the band. Guitarist Dave Genn referred to the process as &quot;taking a long and painful shit&quot;, however people always misquote Dave when he says this. This quote was referring to the process of making ANY record, not specifically the making of The Audio of Being. [2] Front-man Matthew Good was very ill during much of the sessions[citation needed]. The tension between the band continued to grow and even caused Genn to leave the band only to return a short time later. Ultimately, the band reached the breaking point shortly after the album's release and parted ways, although Rich Priske stayed on as the bassist for Matthew Good's subsequent solo career. Although it is widely believed that the band breaking up was a turbulent and almost violent occurrence, Matthew Good has stated[citation needed] that, although it was less than amicable, it was not nearly as bad as the rumors suggested.\n\nMatthew Good has often harshly criticized[citation needed] the album in interviews, claiming to be very dissatisfied with the result[citation needed]. However, Good later discussed the album on his blog and stated he felt that there are some good songs on it (specifically noting &quot;Sort Of A Protest Song&quot;). In fact, for his 2nd cross-Canada tour in 2004 Good played &quot;The Rat Who Would Be King&quot; and &quot;The Workers Sing a Song of Mass Production&quot; live for the first time ever, as well as &quot;Carmelina&quot; and &quot;Advertising On Police Cars.&quot; Songs from The Audio of Being were also rearranged for Rooms, the second disc of In a Coma, and played on Good's 2006 acoustic tour.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Man of Action&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:01\n2.\t&quot;Carmelina&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n3.\t&quot;Tripoli&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39 (Good, Genn)\n4.\t&quot;Advertising on Police Cars&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08\n5.\t&quot;I, the Throw-Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n6.\t&quot;Truffle Pigs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n7.\t&quot;The Fall of Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 (Good, Genn, Priske, Browne)\n8.\t&quot;Under the Influence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32 (Good, Genn, Priske, Browne)\n9.\t&quot;The Rat Who Would Be King&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:47\n10.\t&quot;Anti-Pop&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n11.\t&quot;The Workers Sing a Song of Mass Production&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n12.\t&quot;Sort of a Protest Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoser Anthems: B Sides &amp; Rarities 2001\n\n\nLoser Anthems: B-Sides and Rarities (normally referred to simply as &quot;Loser Anthems&quot;) was a 2001 EP release by the now-defunct Matthew Good Band. Tracks 1-4 are outtakes from the Beautiful Midnight demo sessions and tracks 5-7 were recorded and mixed at the Warehouse studio in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Flashdance II&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n2.\t&quot;The Man from Harold Wood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n3.\t&quot;My Life as a Circus Clown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n4.\t&quot;Intermezzo: M.

It was released on September 20, 2005. However, even before its release, the album reached #1 on Amazon.ca via pre-orders, and 200 signed copies sold out from Matthew Good's official site in under four hours.\n\nThe album is available in two forms: the regular version and the deluxe. The regular only includes disc one, the deluxe features two audio discs and one DVD. The first disc contains nearly all of the singles released by the Matthew Good Band and Matt solo, lacking only Good's most recent singles (&quot;Near Fantastica&quot;, &quot;It's Been a While Since I Was Your Man&quot;, &quot;In Love with a Bad Idea&quot;) and the singles from the album The Audio of Being (&quot;Carmelina&quot;, &quot;Anti-Pop&quot;). The first disc also contains two new songs (&quot;Oh Be Joyful&quot;, &quot;Big City Life&quot;), as well as a b-side (&quot;Pony Boy&quot;) recorded during the sessions for The Audio of Being.\n\nFor the second disc, Good entered the studio solo with an acoustic guitar and recorded new versions of several songs from his extensive catalog. For added effect, Good miked the street outside the studio as he performed, adding an ambiance to the session that Good particularly enjoyed. Given the scarcity of the two MGB EPs Lo-Fi B-Sides and Loser Anthems, Good decided to add the two discs to the latter half of the second disc as a nod to fans.\n\nThe DVD in the deluxe package includes every promotional video filmed during Good's career, solo and with the Matthew Good Band. As a bonus, Good recorded a commentary track with Bill Morrison, who directed the majority of the videos. The DVD also includes an animated video for &quot;While We Were Hunting Rabbits&quot;, which was created by students at Sheridan College. After Good realized that his favourite songs had not been included in the package, a section featuring those songs accompanied by a slideshow of images similar to the cover artwork was added to the disc.\n\n&quot;Oh Be Joyful&quot;, the first single from In a Coma, was released on July 25, 2005. The song's release was accompanied by a video that many fans found confusing, as it contained little more than a burning fireplace. Matthew Good was quick to defend his video on his blog, saying that it was &quot;one of the greatest temporary musical screen savers of all time&quot; and that it was only intended to appear on his site, not to play on Much Music.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Oh Be Joyful&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 (previously unreleased)\n2.\t&quot;Big City Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 (previously unreleased)\n3.\t&quot;Alert Status Red&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19 (from White Light Rock &amp; Roll Review)\n4.\t&quot;Weapon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06 (from Avalanche)\n5.\t&quot;In a World Called Catastrophe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59 (from Avalanche)\n6.\t&quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n7.\t&quot;Load Me Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n8.\t&quot;Strange Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n9.\t&quot;The Future Is X-Rated&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n10.\t&quot;Everything Is Automatic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 (from Underdogs)\n11.\t&quot;Rico&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 (from Underdogs)\n12.\t&quot;Apparitions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14 (from Underdogs)\n13.\t&quot;Indestructible&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26 (from Underdogs)\n14.\t&quot;Symbolistic White Walls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 (from Last of the Ghetto Astronauts)\n15.\t&quot;Haven't Slept in Years&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 (from Raygun)\n16.\t&quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 (from Last of the Ghetto Astronauts)\n17.\t&quot;Pony Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 (previously unreleased)\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\nPart One: Rooms (acoustic reworkings)\n\n1.\t&quot;Truffle Pigs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n2.\t&quot;Tripoli&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n3.\t&quot;Generation X-Wing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n4.\t&quot;Apparitions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n5.\t&quot;North American for Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n6.\t&quot;Advertising on Police Cars&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n7.\t&quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n8.\t&quot;Strange Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n9.\t&quot;Prime Time Deliverance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n\nPart Two: Loser Anthems\n\n10.\t&quot;Flashdance II&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n11.\t&quot;The Man from Harold Wood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n12.\t&quot;My Life as a Circus Clown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n13.\t&quot;Intermezzo: M.

Released in 2003, the album marked a creative departure from his earlier work with the Matthew Good Band, and featured accompaniment by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra on several tracks.\n\nThe album had three singles: &quot;Weapon&quot;, &quot;In a World Called Catastrophe&quot; and &quot;Near Fantastica&quot;, although &quot;Near Fantastica&quot; was released only to radio in a substantially shorter edit. The music video for &quot;Weapon&quot; won a Juno Award, which was shared between Good and co-director Ante Kovac (Good refused to accept the award, however, as he boycotts the Juno Awards).\n\nProducer Warne Livesey, who previously worked with Good on the massively successful Beautiful Midnight, received a Juno Award nomination for his work on Avalanche. An excerpt of &quot;Weapon&quot; was used as the opening credits theme music for CTV's series The Eleventh Hour.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n2.\t&quot;Lullaby for the New World Order&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n3.\t&quot;Weapon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n4.\t&quot;In a World Called Catastrophe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57\n5.\t&quot;Avalanche&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:26\n6.\t&quot;21st Century Living&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n7.\t&quot;While We Were Hunting Rabbits&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:00\n8.\t&quot;Bright End of Nowhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n9.\t&quot;Near Fantastica&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:00\n10.\t&quot;Song for the Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n11.\t&quot;Double Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n12.\t&quot;A Long Way Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n13.\t&quot;House of Smoke and Mirrors&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Light Rock &amp; Roll Review 2004\n\n\nWhite Light Rock &amp; Roll Review is Matthew Good's second album as a solo artist, and was released on June 15, 2004. Though it was not as well-received as his previous solo effort, Avalanche, it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada.[1]\n\nRecording sessions for White Light Rock &amp; Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche, making it the shortest time spent between records for Good. Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music, Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who, who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor. To this end, Good sought about writing songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences. In fact, many of the records tracks (including &quot;Little Terror&quot;, &quot;North American for Life&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies Over Bad Lands&quot;, &quot;It's Been A While Since I Was Your Man&quot;, and &quot;Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra&quot;) were written and performed live, well in advance of the album's release.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Put Out Your Lights&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:03\n2.\t&quot;Poor Man's Grey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:22\n3.\t&quot;We're So Heavy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n4.\t&quot;Empty Road&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n5.\t&quot;Alert Status Red&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n6.\t&quot;Little Terror&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n7.\t&quot;In Love With a Bad Idea&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n8.\t&quot;North American for Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07 (Good, Thor Valdsen, Priske, Steward)\n9.\t&quot;Blue Skies Over Bad Lands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:14\n10.\t&quot;It's Been A While Since I Was Your Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n11.\t&quot;Buffalo Seven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n12.\t&quot;Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12/ &quot;Hopeless&quot;* ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Music 2007\n\n\nHospital Music is the third solo album by Canadian musician Matthew Good. It was released on July 31, 2007[2] Good performed nearly all the instruments himself, with the exception of drums and a few guitar and bass parts.[3] The album artwork was painted by Vancouver resident Jeremy Crowle.\n\n&quot;Born Losers&quot; was featured as the &quot;Single of the Week&quot; on the American iTunes Store for the week starting July 31, 2007. Hospital Music debuted at #17 on the iTunes charts in its opening week, a feat which was called &quot;unprecedented for an album with no label affiliation whatsoever.&quot;[4] The feat was referred to as &quot;the story the record labels have always feared.&quot;[5] The debut was also significant due to Good's lack of previous success in the U.S. market, where he had previously released only one album - 2001's Beautiful Midnight, which failed to make a major impact on the U.S. charts (due to Good's lack of co-operation).\n\nHospital Music debuted at #1 on the Canadian albums chart, selling over 11,000 copies in its first week of release.[6] The album was certified Gold in Canada on January 16, 2008. [7]\n\nIt was nominated at the 2008 Juno Awards for Best Rock Album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Champions of Nothing&quot; - 9:35\n2.\t&quot;A Single Explosion&quot; - 3:04\n3.\t&quot;Metal Airplanes&quot; - 5:43\n4.\t&quot;99% of Us Is Failure&quot; - 5:39\n5.\t&quot;Born Losers&quot; - 5:21\n6.\t&quot;Odette&quot; - 3:31\n7.\t&quot;Black Helicopter&quot; - 4:46\n8.\t&quot;The Boy Come Home&quot; - 4:57\n9.\t&quot;The Devil's in Your Details&quot; (Matthew Good/Ryan Dahle) - 3:58\n10.\t&quot;Moon Over Marin&quot; (Dead Kennedys) - 3:10\n11.\t&quot;Girl Wedged Under the Front of a Firebird&quot; - 1:25\n12.\t&quot;I Am Not Safer Than a Bank&quot; - 0:55\n13.\t&quot;I'm a Window&quot; - 3:37\n14.\t&quot;She's In It for the Money&quot; - 5:09\n15.\t&quot;True Love Will Find You in the End&quot; (Daniel Johnston) - 2:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive At Massey Hall 2008\n\n\nLive At Massey Hall is a live album by Canadian musician Matthew Good.
