Aissaoui, A. Tahour (ExLi4EvA, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nRenewable energies constitute excellent solutions to both the increase of energy consumption and environment problems. Among these energies, wind energy is very interesting. Wind energy is the subject of advanced research. In the development of wind turbine, the design of its different structures is very important. It will ensure: the robustness of the system, the energy efficiency, the optimal cost and the high reliability. The use of advanced control technology and new technology products allows bringing the wind energy conversion system in its optimal operating mode. Different strategies of control can be applied on generators, systems relating to blades, etc. in order to extract maximal power from the wind. The goal of this book is to present recent works on design, control and applications in wind energy conversion systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae24fbf19013d3ba25c1bb1aaea9f8b7a3687dc","amp;dn":"Wind+Turbines+-+Design%2C+Control+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae24fbf19013d3ba25c1bb1aaea9f8b7a3687dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,226,79,191,25,1,61,59,162,92,27,177,170,234,159,139,122,54,135,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
