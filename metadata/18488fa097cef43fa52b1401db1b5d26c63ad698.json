Stanton Evans, Herbert Romerstein, &quot;Stalin's Secret Agents: The Subversion of Roosevelt's Government&quot;\nISBN: 143914768X | 2012 | EPUB| 304 pages | 988 KB\n\nUntil now, many sinister events that transpired in the clash of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superpowers at the close of World War II and the ensuing Cold War era have been ignored, distorted, and kept hidden from the public. Through a meticulous examination of primary sources and disclosure of formerly secret records, this riveting account of the widespread infiltration of the federal government by StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“agents of influenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the damage they inflicted will shock readers.\n\nFocusing on the wartime conferences of Teheran and Yalta, veteran journalist M. Stanton Evans and intelligence expert Herbert Romerstein, the former head of the U.S. Office to Counter Soviet Disinformation, draw upon years of research and a meticulous examination of primary sources to trace the vast deception that kept StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s henchmen on the federal payroll and sabotaged policy overseas in favor of the Soviet Union. While FDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health and mental capacities weakened, aides such as Lauchlin Currie and Harry Hopkins exerted pro-Red influence on U.S. policyÃ¢â‚¬â€leading to massive breaches of internal security and the betrayal of free-world interests. Along with revealing the extent to which the Soviet threat was obfuscated or denied, this in-depth analysis exposes the rigging of at least two grand juries and the subsequent multilayered cover-up to protect those who let the infiltration happen. Countless officials of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations turned a blind eye to the penetration problem. The documents and facts presented in this thoroughly researched expose indict in historical retrospect the people responsible for these corruptions of justice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18488fa097cef43fa52b1401db1b5d26c63ad698","amp;dn":"Stalin%27s+Secret+Agents%3A+The+Subversion+of+Roosevelt%27s+Government","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18488fa097cef43fa52b1401db1b5d26c63ad698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,72,143,160,151,206,244,63,165,43,20,1,219,27,93,38,198,58,214,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
