Barham left nearly immediately, eventually settling in fellow shoegazing band Pale Saints. Robin Guthrie helped the band sign to 4AD Records and released Scar, an EP, in 1989. Critical praise for Scar and a wildly popular live show established Lush as one of the best-selling bands in the shoegazing genre. The following year, the EPs Mad Love, produced by Robin Guthrie, and Sweetness and Light were released.\n\nOrigin: England\nGenre(s): Shoegazing, Dream pop, Britpop\n\n9 Albums:\n\n1. Demos\n\n2.
