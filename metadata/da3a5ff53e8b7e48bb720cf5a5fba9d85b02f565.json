J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. The series follows an FBI Fringe Division team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses unorthodox &quot;fringe&quot; science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate &quot;the Pattern&quot;, a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences which are occurring all over the world. The show has been described as a cross between The X-Files, Altered States, The Twilight Zone, and Dark Angel\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_Series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_Series)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da3a5ff53e8b7e48bb720cf5a5fba9d85b02f565","amp;dn":"Fringe+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da3a5ff53e8b7e48bb720cf5a5fba9d85b02f565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,58,95,245,62,139,126,72,187,114,12,245,165,251,169,216,91,2,245,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
