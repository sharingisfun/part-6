In 1976, producer Art Brambila was putting together an album of songs honoring labor organizer and activist Cesar Chavez, and Brambila chose Los Lobos, then a local Mexican folk combo, to be the backing band for the project, accompanying a variety of vocalists doing songs celebrating ChavezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accomplishments, the struggle of farm workers, and Chicano pride. SÃƒÂ­ Se Puede! was the result, and it documents Los Lobos when they were still primarily a folk ensemble, before they embraced the more eclectic sound that first popped up on 1983Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Â¦And a Time to Dance.\n\nAnyone who has heard Del Este de Los Angeles or 1988Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s La Pistola y el CorazÃƒÂ³n knows Los Lobos were an uncommonly good folk ensemble, but in this case Los Lobos are the backing band on most tracks, providing passionate and expert accompaniment but staying out of the way of the guest vocalists, most of whom deliver fine and impassioned work, especially Carmen Moreno, Raul Bambila, and Geree Gonzalez. (And as one might expect, nearly all the vocals on SÃƒÂ­ Se Puede! are in Spanish.) Los Lobos do take the lead on one cut, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Telingo Lingo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and it allows a bit more of their personality to shine through, but ultimately SÃƒÂ­ Se Puede! is a flashback to the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest days as working musicians, and while this is often strong and inspiring music (and a genuinely heartfelt tribute to Chavez and his brave work), it might feel a bit pro forma for fans used to the ambitious reach of this bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best recordings; if the question is, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is this the same band that made Kiko?,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the honest answer is Ã¢â‚¬Å“No, not yet.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44831ba2c58ec4ab0c95d95a0bfacd6dcdb40f75","amp;dn":"Los+Lobos+And+Friends+-+Si+Se+Puede+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44831ba2c58ec4ab0c95d95a0bfacd6dcdb40f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,131,27,162,197,142,196,171,12,149,217,90,11,250,205,109,205,180,15,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
