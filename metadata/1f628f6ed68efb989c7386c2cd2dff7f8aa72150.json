For a band who reached their peak with Achtung Baby (10 years after catapulting themselves into the music industry), the 1990s offered U2 the chance to reinvent and reform their ideas and these videos showcase their range of influences and achievements during the decade.\n\nObviously treated with the same attention and care as a movie release, this compilation delivers every single video produced for the band in the 90s and--to add a U2-style cut above the rest stamp on the release--each track is accompanied by a director's commentary. The collection kick-starts with &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;, with its amazingly audacious camerawork, and also includes the never-before-released &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot;, directed by Wim Wenders and featuring Salman Rushdie. The commentaries range in quality; from the mesmerising Anton Corbijn's &quot;One&quot;, to the rather dull and pointless commentary on &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;. The compilation is of course a must-have for any U2 fan, but also a welcome insight into the process of video-making. \n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1. Even Better Than Real Thing\n2.
