In this game, Monkey Island meets Diablo!\nCharming, clever, mysterious. These are just some of the words that would not be appropriate in describing DeathSpank. First strike, and ask questions later - it's not about the local hero. He does not even understand why on earth there are any questions. DeathSpank - rarest of rare, it's a really funny video.\nDeathSpank is a fascinating hack'n'slash RPG, the action taking place in a huge and dangerous world. In between the fierce fighting, the protagonist also solves the riddle thrown in the tangled plot.\n\nFeatures:\n&quot;A huge, seamless world.&quot;\n&quot;A lot of weapons and armor.&quot;\n&quot;The epic story. And it is not what you are used to seeing in a video game.&quot;\n&quot;Sophisticated but at the same time pure puzzles.&quot;\n&quot;Mystical artifact called Artifact.&quot;\n&quot;Pieces that explode and blow up your brain.&quot;\n&quot;Pieces that do not explode and blow up your brain.&quot;\n\nScreenshots\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nDeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue; Year: 2010; Includes: DLC Packs 1 and 2\n\nCover:\n\nSystem requirements:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ available storage: 2 GB minimum\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Video Card: ATI Radeon X1800 GTO 256MB and the Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra 256MB cards; Shader 2.0 and 24 bit depth buffer support required\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Local co-op requirements: A controller is required for the second player\n\nDescription:\n\nDeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is the sequel to DeathSpank, released in July. The protagonist must destroy the six magical belts that enslaved their masters. Thongs of Virtue takes place features an unprecedented location, as well as modern and sci-fi weapons and enemies. For the local co-op, a new character - &quot;Ninjatastic Steve&quot; - is available.\nThongs of Virtue offer a longer storyline campaign, during which Deathspank crosses the seas on a pirate ship, visits the North Pole and fights with alien robots. History will again be very comical and fun to collect the powerful &quot;artifacts&quot; in the name of saving the universe. In the sequel, the hero will have to seek the six &quot;all-powerful&quot; cowards who are granted unprecedented power and who converted all of their respective owners in terrible villains. All panties which got into &quot;the wrong hands&quot; must be destroyed. Due to Ron Gilbert's part, the amount of humor per square meter will not decrease.\nPlaying DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is much like the original game - beat enemies to death, to gain experience open prize cards with special abilities. Hothead Games promises that the puzzles become more complex and the NPCs too somewhat, but you have to think about what items you need to connect together in the inventory.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nDeathSpank: The Baconing; Year: 2011; Includes: DLC &quot;Roesha&quot; (co-op)\n\nCover:\n\nSystem requirements:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Video: ATI Radeon X1900 GT 256MB and the Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra 256MB PCI-E cards (Shader Model 2.0 and 24bit depth buffer support required)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Free storage: 1.5 GB\n\nDescription:\n\nContinuation of the crazy adventures of DeathSpank!
