Compatible with P3D v1.4 and P3D v2. I'm not a P3D user myself, so I haven't been able to test it, but it should work in P3D Professional as well. However, please note that you MIGHT be unable to update the aircraft with future core updates due to licensing issues if you use it in P3D Professional. Use it in P3D Professional at your own risk!\n\nA2A Simulations is one of the few developers that TRULY deserve their money. If you like their products and have the money, buy them to support them.\n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81246213ff56e9545ecb005aca88cdf58b63a523","amp;dn":"%5BP3D%5D+A2A+Cessna+172+Trainer+v2.0+for+P3D+Academic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81246213ff56e9545ecb005aca88cdf58b63a523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,36,98,19,255,86,233,84,94,203,0,90,202,136,205,245,139,99,165,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
