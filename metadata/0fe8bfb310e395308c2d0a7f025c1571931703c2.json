It focuses mainly on Christopher Ewing (Jesse Metcalfe), the adopted son of Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pamela (Barnes) Ewing, and John Ross Ewing III (Josh Henderson), the son of J. R. (Larry Hagman) and Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray). Both John Ross and Christopher were born during the original series' run and were featured in it as children (although played by different actors). Now grown up, John Ross has become almost a carbon copy of his father, bent on oil, money, and greed. Christopher, meanwhile, has become a lot like Bobby, in that he is more interested in the upkeep of Southfork Ranch, much like his adoptive father. As an additional point of contention, Christopher is also becoming a player in alternative energy (methane clathrate recovery), thereby eschewing the oil business. However John Ross is determined to resurrect the Ewings' former position in the oil industry.\n\n\nCast: Josh Henderson\n      Jesse Metcalfe\n      Jordana Brewster\n      Julie Gonzalo\n      Brenda Strong\n      Patrick Duffy\n      Linda Gray\n      Larry Hagman\n      Mitch Pileggi\n      Emma Bell\n      Kuno Becker\n\n\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\n\nActual Screenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9019/vlcsnap2013041710h44m59.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9019/vlcsnap2013041710h44m59.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1184/vlcsnap2013041710h42m35.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1184/vlcsnap2013041710h42m35.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6474/vlcsnap2013041710h45m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6474/vlcsnap2013041710h45m09.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/580/vlcsnap2013041710h54m13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/580/vlcsnap2013041710h54m13.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1129/vlcsnap2013041710h46m22.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1129/vlcsnap2013041710h46m22.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723760/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723760/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dallastnt.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dallastnt.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe8bfb310e395308c2d0a7f025c1571931703c2","amp;dn":"Dallas+2012+Season+2+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe8bfb310e395308c2d0a7f025c1571931703c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,232,191,179,16,227,149,48,140,45,10,127,2,92,21,113,147,23,3,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
