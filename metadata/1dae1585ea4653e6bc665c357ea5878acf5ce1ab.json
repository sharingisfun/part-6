In 2005, New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones praised Darnielle as &quot;America's best non-hip hop lyricist.&quot; In 2006, Darnielle was included in Paste magazine's list of the 100 Best Living Songwriters.\n\nFor many years, the sole member of The Mountain Goats was Darnielle himself, despite the plural moniker. (During live shows, in what Frere-Jones describes as &quot;a bit of ontological slapstick,&quot; Darnielle would walk onstage with his guitar and announce &quot;Hi, we're the Mountain Goats.&quot;)\n\nDarnielle remains the sole core member of the band, but has worked with a variety of collaborators over the years, including bassist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster (of Superchunk), singer-songwriter Franklin Bruno, bassist and vocalist Rachel Ware, singer-songwriter/producer John Vanderslice, guitarist Kaki King, and Annie Clark (of St. Vincent).\n\nThroughout the '90s, The Mountain Goats were known for producing &quot;militantly lo-fi&quot; home recordings (most famously, on a boom box) and releasing recordings in cassette or vinyl 7&quot; formats. Since 2002, the Mountains Goats have transitioned to a more polished approach, recording studio albums with a full band.\n\nThe Mountain Goats are currently based in Durham, North Carolina.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Eternals Deck, a 2011 album by The Mountain Goats, was released on March 29, 2011. &quot;All Eternals Deck&quot; refers to a fictional set of Tarot cards, the history and details of which are described in the album's liner notes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Eternals_Deck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Eternals_Deck&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
