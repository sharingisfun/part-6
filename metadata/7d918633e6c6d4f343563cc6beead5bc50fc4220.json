Four of the\ntracks come from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1972 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Machine HeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album. It featured\nwhat many consider the classic Deep Purple lineup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ian Gillan\n(Vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (Guitars), Roger Glover (Bass), Jon Lord\n(Organ) and Ian Paice (Drums). Originally recorded only for the\nJapanese market, the album has since become seen as one of Deep\nPurpleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seminal albums, and one of the greatest live albums of all\ntime (A Rolling Stone magazine readers poll in 2012 voted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Made In\nJapanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as the sixth greatest live album of all time).\n\nHigh Fidelity Pure Audio uses Blu-ray technology to deliver uncompressed\nmusic. Three different sound formats are available: PCM, Dolby True HD,\nand DTS-HD Master Audio, with minimum 24-bit/96kHz.\n\n\nTracks 1-7: Remixed and mastered from the original 1972 analogue multitrack masters.\n\nTracks 8-14: Remastered from the original 1972 analogue stereo master.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n2013 Remix / Master \n\n01 - Highway Star [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [06:43]\n02 - Child In Time [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [12:33]\n03 - Smoke On The Water [Osaka - 15th August 1972] [07:19]\n04 - The Mule [Tokyo - 17th August 1972] [09:28]\n05 - Strange Kind Of Women [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [09:52]\n06 - Lazy [Tokyo - 17th August 1972] [10:25]\n07 - Space Truckin' [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [19:50]\n\n1972 Mix \n\n08 - Highway Star [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [06:42]\n09 - Child In Time [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [12:16]\n10 - Smoke On The Water [Osaka - 15th August 1972] [07:36]\n11 - The Mule [Tokyo - 17th August 1972] [09:28]\n12 - Strange Kind Of Women [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [09:52]\n13 - Lazy [Tokyo - 16th August 1972] [10:25]\n14 - Space Truckin' [Osaka - 16th August 1972] [19:56]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Deep Purple\nGenre: Hard rock / Heavy metal / Blues rock\nAlbum Release Year: Blu-ray 2014\nLabel: Universal\nBarcode: 0602537719365\nNumber of Tracks: 14\nTotal Duration: 2:32:24.824 (877 903 056 samples)\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: WAV/PCM\nCodec Version: PCM\nEncoding Bit Rate: 4608 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 24bit / 96,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original Blu-ray Release M2TS\nDVD / BluRay Ripper: AnyDVD\nConverter: DVD Audio Extractor\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nAdditional Files: MD5, foo_dr and M3U\nChecksums Files Made With: Trader's Little Helper\nTotal File Size: 4.90 GB (5,268,691,945 bytes)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1452155&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1452155&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d918633e6c6d4f343563cc6beead5bc50fc4220","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+In+Japan+%5B96kHz-24bit%5D+2014+%5BWAV%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d918633e6c6d4f343563cc6beead5bc50fc4220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,145,134,51,230,198,212,243,67,86,60,198,190,234,213,188,80,252,66,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
