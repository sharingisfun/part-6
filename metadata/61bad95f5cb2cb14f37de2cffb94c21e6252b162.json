It assumes little in the way of prior knowledge, introducing relevant mathematics and carefully developing it within a physics context. Designed to provide a logical development of the subject, the book is divided into four sections, introductory material on dynamics, and special relativity, which is then followed by more advanced coverage of dynamics and special relativity. Each chapter includes problems ranging in difficulty from simple to challenging with?solutions for solving problems.\n\nIncludes?solutions for solving problems\nNumerous worked examples included throughout the book\nMathematics is carefully explained and developed within a physics environment\nSensitive to topics that can appear daunting or confusing\n\nProduct Details:\n\n\nPaperback: 338 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (March 5, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470014601\nISBN-13: 978-0470014608\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bad95f5cb2cb14f37de2cffb94c21e6252b162","amp;dn":"Dynamics+and+Relativity+by+Jeffrey+Forshaw+and+Gavin+Smith+%5B%3D%3DHx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bad95f5cb2cb14f37de2cffb94c21e6252b162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,186,217,95,92,178,203,20,243,125,226,207,251,148,194,30,98,82,177,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
