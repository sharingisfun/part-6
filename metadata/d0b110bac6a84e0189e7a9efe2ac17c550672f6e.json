This form of contemplation, with its constant commitment to witnessing without attachment, disempowers the egoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fixation on its products, leading instead to the realization that the witnessing consciousness is, in fact, the one immutable Being within or without--the real Self, the true You.\nThe universal illusion rests upon space and time, body and elements, the life force, mind, intellect, ego, and Self. Jnana Yoga reveals not only the insubstantial and illusory nature of our presumptions but also our habitual commitment to the illusion of being an individual that they create. This illusion collapses like a house of cards before direct inspection. When something has form, when it can change, it cannot be the eternal with which we seek union. Witnessing consciousness stands alone as that which is without form. In The Yoga of Truth, Marchand leads us simply, and compellingly, to the truth of our nature and the peaceful bliss of true Being.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b110bac6a84e0189e7a9efe2ac17c550672f6e","amp;dn":"The+Yoga+of+Truth%3A+Jnana%3A+The+Ancient+Path+of+Silent+Knowledge+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b110bac6a84e0189e7a9efe2ac17c550672f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,177,16,186,198,168,78,1,137,231,169,239,226,172,23,197,80,103,47,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
