What's it like to be able to smell not just every bit of open food in the house but also to smell sadness in humans, or even the passage of time? How does a tiny dog manage to play successfully with a Great Dane? What is it like to hear the bodily vibrations of insects or the hum of a fluorescent light? Why must a person on a bicycle be chased? What's it like to use your mouth as a hand? In short, what is it like for a dog to experience life from two feet off the ground, amidst the smells of the sidewalk, gazing at our ankles or knees?\n\nInside of a Dog explains these things and much more. The answers can be surprisingÃ¢â‚¬â€once we set aside our natural inclination to anthropomorphize dogs. Inside of a Dog also contains up-to-the-minute researchÃ¢â‚¬â€on dogs' detection of disease, the secrets of their tails, and their skill at reading our attentionÃ¢â‚¬â€that Horowitz puts into useful context. Although not a formal training guide, Inside of a Dog has practical application for dog lovers interested in understanding why their dogs do what they do. With a light touch and the weight of science behind her, Alexandra Horowitz examines the animal we think we know best but may actually understand the least. This book is as close as you can get to knowing about dogs without being a dog yourself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b957fddea35eb5a13ba5d7a47d857ecc26d5b3","amp;dn":"Inside+of+a+Dog+-+What+Dogs+See%2C+Smell%2C+and+Know+by+Alexandra+Ho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b957fddea35eb5a13ba5d7a47d857ecc26d5b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,185,87,253,222,163,94,181,161,59,165,215,164,125,133,126,204,38,213,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
