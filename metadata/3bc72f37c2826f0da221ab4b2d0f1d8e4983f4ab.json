Drawing on the insights of health care professionals, children's advocates, and industry insiders, the film focuses on the explosive growth of child marketing in the wake of deregulation, showing how youth marketers have used the latest advances in psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience to transform American children into one of the most powerful and profitable consumer demographics in the world. Consuming Kids pushes back against the wholesale commercialization of childhood, raising urgent questions about the ethics of children's marketing and its impact on the health and well-being of kids.\n\nFeaturing: Dan Acuff | Enola Aird | Michael Brody | Nancy Carlsson-Paige | Josh Golin | Allen Kanner | Velma LaPoint | Diane Levin | Susan Linn | Robert Reiher | Michael Rich | Gary Ruskin | Nick Russell | Juliet Schor | Betsy Taylor | David Walsh\n\nSections: The Floodgates Open | By Any Means Necessary | Under the Microscope | Brand New World | Cradle to Grave | Rewiring Childhood | Our Future\n\n\n844mb, 720x480, 1500kbps Xvid, 67 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc72f37c2826f0da221ab4b2d0f1d8e4983f4ab","amp;dn":"Consuming+Kids%3A+The+Commercialization+of+Childhood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc72f37c2826f0da221ab4b2d0f1d8e4983f4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,199,47,55,194,130,111,13,162,33,171,75,45,15,29,142,73,131,244,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
