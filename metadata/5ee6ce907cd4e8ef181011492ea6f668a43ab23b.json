Barroom brawls. Poisonous snakes. Cholera-infected drinking water. Tumbleweed abrasion. Something called Ã¢â‚¬Å“toe-foot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even a trip to the outhouse. Yes, there are a million ways to die in the wild, wild West, and Albert plans to avoid them all. Some people think that makes him a coward. Albert calls it common sense. But when his girlfriend dumps him for the most insufferable guy in town, Albert decides to fight backÃ¢â‚¬â€even though he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shoot, ride, or throw a punch. Fortunately, he teams up with a beautiful gunslinger whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough enough for the both of them. Unfortunately, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s married to the biggest, meanest, most jealous badass on the frontier. Turns out Albert has just discovered a million and one ways to die in the West.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee6ce907cd4e8ef181011492ea6f668a43ab23b","amp;dn":"A+Million+Ways+To+Die+In+the+West+by+Seth+Macfarlane+%28ePUB%2C+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee6ce907cd4e8ef181011492ea6f668a43ab23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,230,206,144,124,212,232,239,24,16,17,73,46,166,246,104,164,58,178,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
