Its purpose is to get you started on a solid education in Internet security. As such, it is probably constructed differently from any computer book you have ever read.\n\nAlthough this book cannot teach you everything you need to know, the  references contained within this book can. Therefore, if you know very little about Internet security, you will want to maximize the value of this book by adhering to the following procedure:Each chapter (except early ones that set the stage) contains intermittent references that might point to white papers, technical reports, or other sources of solid, reliable information of substance (pertaining to the topic at hand). Those  references appear in boxes labeled XREF. As you encounter each source, stop for a moment to retrieve that source from the Net. After you retrieve the source, read it, then continue reading the book. Throughout the book, perform this operation whenever and wherever applicable. If you do so, you will finish with a very solid basic education on Internet security.\n\n[b]\nBook Details :\n\nSize :\nTitle : Maximum Security: A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Internet Site and Network\nPages : 670\nFormat : pdf[/b]\n\nFollow us on facebook :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.&lt;/a&gt; facebook .com /torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b2821b825b122bc00f3d1059bf12b3dff07d71","amp;dn":"Maximum+Security%3A+A+Hacker%27s+Guide+to+Protecting+Your+Internet+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b2821b825b122bc00f3d1059bf12b3dff07d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,178,130,27,130,91,18,43,192,15,61,16,89,191,18,179,223,240,125,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
