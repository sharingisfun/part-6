He also got crappy ice cream, a barrage of \npropaganda and a chance to fly paper airplanes out of his 15th-floor hotel \nwindow. Combining a gift for anecdote and an ear for absurd dialogue, \nHis retelling of his adventures makes a gently humorous counterpoint \nto the daily news stories about the axis of evil, a Lost in Translation for \nthe Communist world. Delisle shifts between accounts of his work as an animator \nand life as a visitor in a country where all foreigners take up only two floors \nof a 50-story hotel. Delisle s simple but expressive art works well with his \naccount, humanizing the few North Koreans he gets to know (including \n&quot;Comrade Guide&quot; and &quot;Comrade Translator&quot;), and facilitating digressions \ninto North Korean history and various bizarre happenings involving brandy \nand bear cubs. Pyongyang will appeal to multiple audiences: current events \nbuffs, Persepolis fans and those who just love a good yarn.\n\n\n\n\n*** Enjoy and Please SEED ***\n\n\n\nComic Crew:\n\nSOME GUY - http://thepiratebay.se/user/MrDowntown/\nTHE MASTER - http://thepiratebay.se/user/mirrormaster82/\nDYNAMO KID - http://thepiratebay.se/user/GunningHawk90/\nBULK UPLOADER - http://thepiratebay.se/user/joshua13/\n0-DAY WARRIOR - http://thepiratebay.se/user/shipJ/\nTHE OTHER DUDE - http://thepiratebay.se/user/jormis29/\n\n\nCheck out our torrents, post [reasonable] requests on our most recent torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff474258c6d92edaf735847ac33d1617b22c0a3","amp;dn":"Pyongyang%3A+A+Journey+in+North+Korea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff474258c6d92edaf735847ac33d1617b22c0a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,244,116,37,140,109,146,237,175,115,88,71,172,51,209,97,123,34,192,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
