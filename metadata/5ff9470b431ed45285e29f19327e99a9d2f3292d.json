But instead he woke up one day to find himself fired from his radio job, surrounded by feral cats, and emotionally and financially annihilated by a divorce from a woman he thought he loved. He tried to heal his broken heart through whatever means he could find - minor-league hoarding, Viagra addiction, accidental racial profiling, cat fancying, flying airplanes with his mind - but nothing seemed to work. It was only when he was stripped down to nothing that he found his way back.\n\nAttempting Normal is Marc MaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey through the wilderness of his own mind, a collection of explosively, painfully, addictively funny stories that add up to a moving tale of hope and hopelessness, of failing, flailing, and finding a way. From standup to television to his outrageously popular podcast, WTF with Marc Maron, Marc has always been a genuine original, a disarmingly honest, intensely smart, brutally open comic who finds wisdom in the strangest places. This is his story of the winding, potholed road from madness and obsession and failure to something like normal, the thrillingly comic journey of a sympathetic f--kup whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying really hard to do better without making a bigger mess. Most of us will relate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff9470b431ed45285e29f19327e99a9d2f3292d","amp;dn":"Attempting+Normal+-+Marc+Maron+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff9470b431ed45285e29f19327e99a9d2f3292d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,249,71,11,67,30,212,82,133,226,159,25,50,126,153,169,210,243,41,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
