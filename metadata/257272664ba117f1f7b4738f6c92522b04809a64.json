Now, with the release of Billy: The Early Years, we meet Billy as the earnest promising young man at the crossroads of faith and doubt, ultimately facing the moment of decision that launched one of history's most powerful evangelistic careers.\n\nMost compellingly, Billy: The Early Years paints its portrait of Graham against the backdrop of his relationship with Charles Templeton, another gifted young preacher whose faith could not withstand the onslaught of scientific skepticism. He and Graham parted ways and in the film, Templeton comes to personify the rising tide of disbelief into which Graham launched his crusades.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGraham questioned whether he should go back and be a dairy farmer and follow in his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s footsteps, instead of his Father in heaven,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says producer and writer Bill McKay. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe was right on the cusp of shrinking back on his calling. He was wrestling with God. But he came to an absolutely concrete understanding from God to take the Bible by faith.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As we all now know, that faith, so dramatically portrayed in the film by Armie Hammer, would go on to change the face of modern evangelism.\n\nThe cast includes Armie Hammer, Stefanie Butler, Jennifer O'Neill, Lindsay Wagner, and Martin Landau.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=2494&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=2494&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploaded by Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257272664ba117f1f7b4738f6c92522b04809a64","amp;dn":"Billy%3A+The+Early+Years+%282008%29%28Christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257272664ba117f1f7b4738f6c92522b04809a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,114,114,102,75,161,23,241,247,180,115,143,108,146,82,43,4,128,154,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
