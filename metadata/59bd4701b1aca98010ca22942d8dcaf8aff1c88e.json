Allmusic music journalist, Jason Ankeny states &quot;Clad in Civil War era Union Army uniforms (complete with fictitious military ranks) and bizarrely pedophilic lyrics, Puckett and the Union Gap were in their own way as far-out and singular as any other act of the period.&quot;\n\nFrontman Gary Puckett (born October 17, 1942, Hibbing, Minnesota) grew up in Yakima, Washington (adjacent to the city of Union Gap) and Twin Falls, Idaho, graduating from Twin Falls High School. He picked up the guitar as a teenager, and while attending college in San Diego played in a number of local bands before quitting school to focus on music. Puckett eventually landed with the Outcasts, a hard rock group comprised of bassist Kerry Chater, keyboardist Gary 'Mutha' Withem, tenor saxophonist Dwight Bement, and drummer Paul Wheatbread. Withem was a former pupil at Eastlake High Scool, Chula Vista, California. In 1966 Wheatbread relocated to Los Angeles, California to serve as the house drummer on the television series, Where the Action Is; the remaining members of the Outcasts toured the Pacific Northwest. On their return, Wheatbread also moved back to San Diego and rejoined the line-up.\n\nA demo was recorded, and the band's manager arranged a meeting with CBS record producer, Jerry Fuller. Impressed by Puckett's soaring baritone, Fuller also admired their soft rock leanings and in 1967, and they were quickly signed to a recording contract by Columbia Records. Re-christened the Union Gap, on August 16, 1967, the band recorded its first single, &quot;Woman Woman.&quot; It was their first hit, and &quot;Woman, Woman&quot; (written by Jim Glaser and Jimmy Payne) reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was a million-seller by February 1968 with gold disc status. Concurrent CBS press releases gave each member his own imaginary military rank ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Puckett was the general, Bement the sergeant, Chater the corporal, and both Withem and Wheatbread were relegated to privates.\n\nThis was followed during the next two years by &quot;Young Girl&quot; (#2), &quot;Lady Willpower&quot; (#2), &quot;Over You&quot; (#7) and &quot;Don't Give In To Him&quot; (#15). &quot;Young Girl&quot;, written by Fuller, had the age-old theme of the temptation of underage romance: &quot;My love for you is way out of line/you better run, girl, you're much too young, girl,&quot; an anguished Puckett wailed. Controversial at the time, it was dramatically delivered in Puckett's trademark tones and with a memorable strings and brass arrangement, the song was an instant classic and is still much played on radio today. &quot;Young Girl&quot; was the second million selling disc for the band, which it reached less than two months after issue. Both &quot;Lady Willpower&quot; and &quot;Over You&quot; continued the gold disc run of form.\n\nThey also headlined at the White House and Disneyland, but there was dissension in the ranks: the Union Gap wanted to write and produce their own material, and Puckett found himself increasingly confined within the ballad formula. In 1969, stalemate: Fuller assembled a 40-piece studio orchestra for a new song he had written, but Puckett and the Union Gap refused to cut the tune. The session was ultimately canceled, and Fuller never again worked with the group, but for the Union Gap, it was a pyrrhic victory.\n\nIn 1969 the band were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist; losing out to JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Feliciano.\n\nThe band immediately returned to the Top Ten that autumn with the Dick Glasser produced &quot;This Girl Is a Woman Now,&quot; but it was to be their last hit. The follow-up, &quot;Let's Give Adam and Eve Another Chance,&quot; failed to chart in the Top 40, and after management dictated that Puckett's bandmates now receive a weekly salary instead of a percentage of the revenue, Chater and Withem left the band. Bement took over on bass guitar and keyboardist Barry McCoy and horn player Richard Gabriel were added. The Civil War gear was abandoned but prospects did not improve. In 1970, Puckett began recording as a solo act, but his efforts were not well-received; the Union Gap remained his live backing band, until they were dismissed following an appearance at the 1971 Orange County Fair. Puckett's recording contract was terminated one year later.\n\nAlthough the band never had a #1 record in the United States, &quot;Young Girl&quot; reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart. Puckett's powerful voice, and the skills of producer/songwriter Fuller, made this band one of the most familiar sounds on the radio during this period. In addition, many of their songs were loosely linked by a common theme of female empowerment, which was unusual for the era and genre. Another characteristic of The Union Gap that distinguishes it from its contemporaries was the band's (at the time) risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© lyrics.\n\nAfter the Union Gap was disbanded, Puckett had modest success as a solo artist, mostly performing and re-recording the band's songs. A comeback tour engineered by music writer Thomas K. Arnold brought him to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1981, and from that point on he became a regular on the national oldies circuit He has also released some new material, including a 2001 holiday album entitled Gary Puckett at Christmas. In 1994 and 2002 Puckett performed at the Moondance Jam near Walker, Minnesota.\n\nBement later joined the oldies act Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids, while Chater relocated to Nashville, Tennessee where he plied his trade as a songwriter. Wheatbread, meanwhile, turned to concert promotion, and Withem returned to San Diego to teach high-school band.\n\nAs of 2007, Puckett continues to perform live concerts in venues across the U.S., including &quot;package&quot; oldies circuit tours with The Association and The Lettermen.  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_puckett_and_the_union_gap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_puckett_and_the_union_gap&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
