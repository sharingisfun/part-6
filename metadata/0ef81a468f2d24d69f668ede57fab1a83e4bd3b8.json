In 1955 the Joe Cuba Sextet came into being and his vibraharp sound caught on. In 1962, when the group recorded &quot;To Be with You&quot; for Seeco Records, the band began to soar to popularity because of Nick Jimenez&amp;#039;s arrangements and the vocals of Cheo Feliciano and Jimmy Sabater. When the boogaloo era arrived, the majority of the popular New York bands were put out of work. The Cuba sound changed with its recordings of &quot;El Pito&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang&quot;; it not only sold millions but enabled The Cuba sextet to enjoy the #1 spot in the Latin music world along with the Eddie Palmieri Orchestra.
