Now, in six brand new episodes, Robson goes where the guide books don't to discover how people in some of the remotest spots on the planet land their daily catch. From a tiny island in the mid-Atlantic to the wastelands of eastern Russia via the Argentinean wilderness, Robson hooks up with some of the most isolated fishermen, catching the most amazing fish. He will be against the clock, fishing in narrow time windows before the weather closes in. This will be his most extreme journey yet, and, if he can pull it off, his greatest triumph.\n\n\n1)  Ascension Island \nRobson Green embarks on a journey profiling fishing destinations around the world and tries to catch some of the most elusive sea creatures. He begins by visiting Ascension Island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean - the most remote place he has ever fished\n\n2)  Patagonia \nRobson Green continues his journey in Patagonia, where he is on a mission to fish in the southernmost city in the world - Ushuaia. He also hopes to catch a chinook salmon in Torres del Paine and deals with foul-smelling bait when he joins a team of commercial fishermen to hunt for a centolla crab\n\n3)  Papua New Guinea \nThe actor heads to the volcanic island of Papua New Guinea, where he enlists the help of hunter Riccard Reimann to catch a fiercely territorial fighting fish. Robson also searches for megapode eggs near Mount Tavurvur, meets fishermen who use hand lines that reach a depth of more than 500ft, and sails out in the open ocean to look for a ruby snapper\n\n4)  Russia \nThe actor heads to eastern Russia and meets the Nanai people, who begin their day with a traditional dance before fishing for northern pike in the Amur river. He also visits the Kamchatka peninsula, where he receives advice from a master angler as he tries to catch his first Russian fish with some unusual methods\n\n5)  New Caledonia \nThe actor continues his adventure in New Caledonia, a collection of islands in the far south-western corner of the Pacific Ocean. He begins by searching for local speciality flame snapper, before trying to catch Spanish mackerel in La Foa. He also joins the Kanak people on the island of Taanlo, where he fishes with spears in open water, takes part in a crab-hunting expedition and tries to land a giant trevally\n\n6)  Argentina \nThe actor concludes his adventure in Argentina and heads to the Parana River. He lays baited lines for the largest freshwater fish in the world - the short-tailed river stingray - before using a curried-fruit lure to catch a pacu for supper. He also visits the San Juan Poriahu ranch to fish for piranha in the surrounding lagoons and tries his luck at the Salto Grande Dam on the river Uruguay.
