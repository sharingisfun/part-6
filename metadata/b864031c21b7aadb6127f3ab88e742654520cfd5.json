These theoretical concepts are supported by 400 fully worked problems, 700 further problems with answers, and 300 multiple-choice questions, all of which add up to give the reader a firm grounding on each topic.\r\n\r\nThe new edition is up to date with the latest BTEC National specifications and can also be used on undergraduate courses in mechanical, civil, structural, aeronautical and marine engineering, together with naval architecture. A further chapter has been added on revisionary mathematics, since progress in engineering studies is not possible without some basic mathematics knowledge. Further worked problems have also been added throughout the text.\r\n\r\n- New chapter on revisionary mathematics\r\n- Student-friendly approach with numerous worked problems, multiple-choice and short-answer questions, exercises, revision tests and nearly 400 diagrams\r\n- Supported with free online material for students and lecturers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b864031c21b7aadb6127f3ab88e742654520cfd5","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Engineering+Principles%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b864031c21b7aadb6127f3ab88e742654520cfd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,100,3,28,33,183,170,219,97,39,243,171,136,231,66,101,69,32,207,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
