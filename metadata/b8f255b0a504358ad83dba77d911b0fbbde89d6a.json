But just what is quantum physics? How does it help us understand the world? Where does it leave Newton and Einstein? And why, above all, can we be sure that the theory is good? The bizarre behaviour of the atoms and energy that make up the universe has led to some very woolly pronouncements on the nature of all interconnectedness. Here, Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw give us the real science, and reveal the profound theories that allow for concrete, yet astonishing, predictions about the world. This is our most up-to-date picture of reality. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f255b0a504358ad83dba77d911b0fbbde89d6a","amp;dn":"The+Quantum+Universe++-++Brian+Cox+++%282011+-+epub%2Fmobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f255b0a504358ad83dba77d911b0fbbde89d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,242,85,176,165,4,53,138,216,61,186,119,217,17,176,251,189,232,157,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
