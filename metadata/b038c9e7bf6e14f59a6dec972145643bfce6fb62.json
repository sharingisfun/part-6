After serving time in a house of correction, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find honest work in the Depression and drifts into becoming a gangsterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moll, kept in luxury by Leo Darcy (Ricardo Cortez in a series of sharp suits) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and dressed in impossibly glamorous outfits designed by Adrian, including a beautiful beaded headdress. \n\nHowever, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the life she wants for herself, and, unlike Bunny, also a moll, she dreams of something more. When a violent incident at a casino throws her together with rich, handsome lawyer Tom Mannering (Franchot Tone), she sees a way back to the straight and narrow and persuades him to give her a job as a secretary. But Leo is keeping an eye on her and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let her go so easily Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the police arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to forget about her either. Before long she is forced back to her old life again, with more twists in store.\n\nBoth Cortez and Tone are fine in their roles, but this is YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film all the way. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of pre-Code suggestiveness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even a scene where ToneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character says he is thinking Ã¢â‚¬Å“about sexÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, while in another sequence Young whispers seductively into CortezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ear to get him into bed and distract him from the crime he is plotting.\n\nBut it is also very much a film about the Great Depression, and, as well as that scene with the neon billboards, there is also a sequence showing YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feet trudging through the streets until her shoes wear out and she has to stuff them with newspaper. The DVD commentary  says that some film-goers of the time complained about scenes like these because they were too close to the reality all around them. Apparently they preferred scenes like the one where Cortez takes Young to buy a fur coat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but really it is the contrast between opulence and poverty which is the keynote of this film.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Midnight Mary (1933)\nLoaned to MGM by her home studio of Warner Bros., Loretta Young suffers her way through the title role in Midnight Mary. A good girl led astray, Mary (Young) endeavors to save the life of her boyfriend Tom (Franchot Tone) by killing the aptly named Leo the Rat (Ricardo Cortez). As her case is heard in court, the clerk goes over Mary's record, and at this point the flashbacks begin, stretching all the way back to her days as an unwanted orphan. One bad break leads to another, and by the time she reaches adulthood Mary is mixed up with a gang of crooked gamblers. For the sake of Tom, a well-connected socialite who loves her unquestioningly, Mary tries to go straight, but her past, and the ill-fated Leo the Rat, catch up with her. No matter what disaster befalls her in Midnight Mary, Loretta Young always manages to look as though she's just stepped out of a beauty salon.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 1:11:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:11:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b038c9e7bf6e14f59a6dec972145643bfce6fb62","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Holywood+Collection+Vol.+3+-+Disk+2+-+Xvid+1cd+-+Midni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b038c9e7bf6e14f59a6dec972145643bfce6fb62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,56,201,231,191,110,20,245,154,109,236,151,33,69,100,59,252,230,251,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
