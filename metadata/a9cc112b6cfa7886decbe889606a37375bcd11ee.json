With original, captivating tales by Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, Ben Bova, David Brin, Cory Doctorow, Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Harry Harrison, Larry Niven, Vernor Vinge, Gene Wolfe, and others, Gateways is a SF event that will be a must-buy for SF readers of all tastes, from the traditional to the cutting edge; from the darkly serious to the laugh-out-loud funny.\r\n\r\nEach author has written a story that he or she feels reflects the effect Pohl has had on the fieldâ€”in the style of writing, the narrative tone, or the subject matter. It says a lot about Pohl's career that the authors represented here themselves span many decades and styles, from the experimental SF of British SF author Brian W. Aldiss to the over-the-top humor of Harry Harrison and Mike Resnick, from the darkly powerful drama of Hollywood screenwriter Frank Robinson to the satiric pungency of multiple Hugo Award-winner Vernor Vinge. Every story here is uniquely nuanced; all of them as entertaining and thought provoking as Pohl's fiction.\r\n\r\nIn a career dating back to 1939, Pohl has won all the awards science fiction has to offer: Hugos, Nebulas, the SFWA Grand Master Award. Having written more than two million words of fiction and edited the groundbreaking Star anthologies and Hugo Award-winning magazines and books, Pohl is an SF icon. This anthology of brilliant, entertaining SF stories is a testament to his stature in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dream of Frederik Pohl â€¢ DAVID LUNDE\r\nIntroduction â€¢ ELIZABETH ANNE HULL\r\nDAVID BRIN â€¢ Shoresteading\r\nPHYLLIS AND ALEX EISENSTEIN â€¢ Von Neumannâ€™s Bug\r\nAppreciation â€¢ ISAAC ASIMOV\r\nJOE HALDEMAN â€¢ Sleeping Dogs\r\nLARRY NIVEN â€¢ Gates (Variations)\r\nAppreciation â€¢ GARDNER DOZOIS\r\nJAMES GUNN â€¢ Tales from the Spaceship Geoffrey\r\nGREGORY BENFORD AND ELISABETH MALARTRE â€¢ Shadows of the Lost\r\nAppreciation â€¢ CONNIE WILLIS\r\nVERNOR VINGE â€¢ A Preliminary Assessment of the Drake Equation, Being an Excerpt from the Memoirs of Star Captain Y.-T.
