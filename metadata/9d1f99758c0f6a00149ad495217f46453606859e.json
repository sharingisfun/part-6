Unfortunately, an expensive music camp is a bit out of reach for her family, but her mother gets a job as Camp Rock&amp;#039;s cook so that Mitchie can attend as long as she helps out in the kitchen between classes. Befriended by fellow camp member Caitlyn (Alyson Stoner) but intimidated by the immensely talented Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin) and her friends Peggy (Jasmine Richards) and Ella (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle), Mitchie lives a double life hiding that she is the cook&amp;#039;s daughter and posing as a well-to-do camper in order to become part of the hottest clique at camp. When she&amp;#039;s overheard singing, but not seen, by teen pop star and celebrity camp instructor, plus lead singer of Connect Three, Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), he is completely taken and sets out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice. Meanwhile, Mitchie will have to learn how to confront her fears, step out of the kitchen and into the spotlight as herself.\n\n\nAVI Format\n\n\nCourtesy Of\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://disneystars1.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://disneystars1.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPBX Release\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1f99758c0f6a00149ad495217f46453606859e","amp;dn":"Camp+Rock+%282008%29+HDTV+XviD+%5BPBX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1f99758c0f6a00149ad495217f46453606859e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,31,153,117,140,15,106,0,20,154,212,149,33,127,70,69,54,6,133,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
