Volume 2's warm up exercise content makes it logical to reverse the order of demonstration on video just as if you were attending a martial art class. The first 33 minutes of the video demonstrate the Basic Training exercises and moves in volume 2. The remainder of the video is the demonstration of moves to defend and counter against attacks as Bruce Lee demonstrated in the Self Defense volume 1. The Video is 52 minutes long.\n\n\nur welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0cbafd01287e75fce54571aef6f61e834a5885","amp;dn":"Bruce.Lee.Fighting.Method-Basic.Training.And.Self.Defense.1992.x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0cbafd01287e75fce54571aef6f61e834a5885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,12,186,253,1,40,126,117,252,229,69,113,174,246,246,30,131,74,88,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
