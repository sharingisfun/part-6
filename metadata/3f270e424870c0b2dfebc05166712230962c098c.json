The effort of applying \ncoordinate transforms is justified by obtaining a more intuitive, concise \nand easy-to-use model.\n\nIn this textbook, mathematics is reduced to a necessary minimum, and priority \nis given to bringing up the system view and explaining the use and external \ncharacteristics of machines on their electrical and mechanical ports. Covering \nthe most relevant concepts related to machine size, torque and power, the \nauthor explains the losses and secondary effects, outlining cases and \nconditions in which some secondary phenomena are neglected.\n\nWhile the goal of developing and using machine mathematical models, \nequivalent circuits and mechanical characteristics persists through the book, \nthe focus is kept on physical insight of electromechanical conversion process. \nDetails such as the slot shape and the disposition of permanent magnets and \ntheir effects on the machine parameters and performance are also covered. \n\nThis textbook is intended for undergraduate students of electrical engineering \nas their first course in electrical machines. It is also recommended for \nstudents preparing capstone projects in which they need to understand, model, \nsupply, control and specify electric machines.  Additionally, it can be used \nas a valuable reference for other engineering disciplines involved with \nelectrical motors and generators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f270e424870c0b2dfebc05166712230962c098c","amp;dn":"Springer+Electrical+Machines+2013+Retail+eBook-kE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f270e424870c0b2dfebc05166712230962c098c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,39,14,66,72,112,192,178,223,235,192,81,102,113,34,48,150,44,9,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
