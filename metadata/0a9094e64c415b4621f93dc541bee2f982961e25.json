Rafferty was born into a working-class family in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His mother taught him both Irish and Scottish folk songs as a boy; later, he was influenced by the music of The Beatles and Bob Dylan. He joined the folk-pop group The Humblebums in 1969. After they disbanded in 1971, he recorded his first solo album, Can I Have My Money Back? Rafferty and Joe Egan formed the group Stealers Wheel in 1972, producing several hits, most notably &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;. In 1978, he recorded his second solo album, City to City, which included &quot;Baker Street&quot;, his most popular song.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Night Owl&quot; is the 1979 album by Gerry Rafferty. It was released a year after Rafferty's platinum-selling album &quot;City To City&quot;. While not quite performing as well as its predecessor, &quot;Night Owl&quot; still managed enough sales to achieve Gold status in North America and the United Kingdom. The title song reached #5 on the UK charts. The album made the UK Top 10.\n\nThe album was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Chipping Norton, England.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9094e64c415b4621f93dc541bee2f982961e25","amp;dn":"Gerry+Rafferty+-+Night+Owl+%5B1979%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9094e64c415b4621f93dc541bee2f982961e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,144,148,230,76,65,91,70,33,249,61,197,65,190,226,249,130,150,30,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
