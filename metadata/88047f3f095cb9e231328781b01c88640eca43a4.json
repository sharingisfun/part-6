Daniel (Moritz Blebitreu) is a shy schoolteacher who is often unsure around women, but when he meets Melek (Idil Under), a beautiful Turkish woman, he falls head over heels in love and agrees to meet up with her in Istanbul. However, while en route from Hamburg, Daniel spots Juli (Christiane Paul), a woman he knows, trying to hitch a ride. Daniel picks her up, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she's long carried a torch for him; when Juli discovers why Daniel is making a long trip through Central Europe, she figures this could be her last chance to win him over. Her attempts to win his affections lead to a number of arguments, reconciliations, unintended turns, and brushes with the wrong side of the law. Im Juli was written and directed by Fatih Akin, who previously won acclaim for the drama Kurz und Schmerzlos. -- Mark Deming\n\n&quot;This film was a marvel as a piece of entertainment. It's tight, fast, funny, surprising, and charming. Part romantic comedy and part road picture, the story is full of twists and delights as it takes you on a ride across Europe, switching languages as we go - German, English, Bulgarian, Turkish. The look of the film is great, with dynamic camera work and beautifully framed scenes. The editing and pace are wonderful, and the music choices are ideal. Acting by both stars couldn't be better for the story, as they are charming, touching, and funny. The story itself will keep you guessing and then wrap-up with an end that's both satisfying and refreshing. Who would have thought a German film could have such lightness and playfulness?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcfaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcfaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcgaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcgaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamchaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamchaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamciaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamciaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcjaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamcjaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamckaabb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/gamckaabb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----my rip-----\n\n~~~~~~ Im Juli.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,258,971,136                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:36:07                \nFrame Count:....................................144170             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................656                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................352                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.864                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1544                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.267&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88047f3f095cb9e231328781b01c88640eca43a4","amp;dn":"Fatih+Akin+-+Im+Juli.+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88047f3f095cb9e231328781b01c88640eca43a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,4,127,63,9,92,185,226,49,50,135,129,176,28,136,100,14,202,67,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
