Dillon for a comprehensive examination\nof  the Crocketts' Mid Atlantic Wrestling. In what can best be described as a tale of two territories, \nyou'll see the style and formulas used by Jim Crockett Sr, and then the direction and decisions that his family\nimplemented after his death in the 70s. J.J. Dillon is the perfect guest for this edition of the show, \nhaving worked in both Crockett eras and also having worked as a manager and office personnel. \nHe and Jim paint a vivid and living picture of the Mid Atlantic era like no one has before. \nThis journey back through one of pro wrestling's most celebrated territories is made even more special\nwith the inclusion of over one hour of lost Mid Atlantic Wrestling footage, thanks to Jim Cornette's collection \nof film he purged from the dumpsters of TBS after the sale of Crockett promotions. \n\nDuration: 3hr. 25min.\nContainer: mp4\nResolution: 640x360\nVideo Bitrate: 800kbps\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 29.97fps\nAudio Format: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96kbps\nNo. of Channels:2 ch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd6da68212329b04e17ba601f6ba08c959b363b","amp;dn":"WWE-WCW-KC.Back.to.the.Territories-Mid+Atlantic.2015.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd6da68212329b04e17ba601f6ba08c959b363b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,214,218,104,33,35,41,176,78,23,186,96,31,107,160,140,149,155,54,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
