Black Francis, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal, and Dave Lovering have been the group&amp;#039;s continual members. The Pixies found only modest success in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, although never achieving mainstream success with their studio albums.\n\nTheir music, heavily influenced by punk and surf music, was, while highly melodic, capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis was the group&amp;#039;s primary songwriter and singer and had a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He typically wrote cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as unidentified flying objects and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, physical injury, and incest feature in many of the band&amp;#039;s songs and imagery.\n\nThe group is frequently posited as the immediate forebearer of the alternative rock boom of the early 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain&amp;#039;s acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies&amp;#039; legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.\n\nAlbums:\n\n1.
