You'll find yourself following along:\n : as Cade and Elle explore Gemini StationÃ¢â‚¬â€an orbiting museum dedicated to    :\n : preserving and sharing technology throughout the centuries.                :\n :                                                                            :\n : Trouble ensues. The station is evacuated, including Cade and Elle's class  :\n : that was visiting the station on a field trip. Cade and Elle donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it :\n : aboard their shuttle and are trapped on the station along with a friendly  :\n : artificial intelligence named Andrew who wants to help them get off the    :\n : damaged station. Using some old hardware, a laptop, and some toolboxes full:\n : of electronics parts, you will follow along and build eight gizmos with    :\n : Cade and Elle that will help them escape from Gemini Station.              :\n :                                                                            :\n : The hardware is Arduino. Each new challenge opens a new area of Arduino and:\n : basic electronics knowledge. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taken incrementally from a simple   :\n : task such as turning on a light through to a complex combination of        :\n : microcontroller, electronic components, and software programming. By the   :\n : end of the book youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be well on your way towards being able to create and:\n : implement any sort of electronically controlled device you can imagine,    :\n : using the stunningly popular Arduino microcontroller.                      :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c91703fe6f78e202953db037d0bbc7887e55777","amp;dn":"Apress+Arduino+Adventures+2013+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c91703fe6f78e202953db037d0bbc7887e55777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,145,112,63,230,247,142,32,41,83,219,3,125,11,188,120,135,229,87,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
