Offering engineers broader coverage than other oscillator design books on the market, this comprehensive resource considers the complete frequency range, from low-frequency audio oscillators to more complex oscillators found at the RF and microwave frequencies. Packed with over 1,200 equations, the book gives professionals a thorough understanding of the principles and practice of oscillator circuit design and emphasizes the use of time-saving CAD (computer aided design) simulation techniques. From the theory and characteristics of oscillators, to the design of a wide variety of oscillators (including tuned-circuit, crystal, negative-resistance, and relaxation oscillators), this unique book is a one-stop reference practitioners can turn to again and again when working on their challenging projects in this field.
