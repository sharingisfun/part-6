A&amp;E has secured the U.S. format for the critically acclaimed crime series in Denmark. The series is about violent criminals who are surrounded by fear and mystique- the serial killer. When murders are not grounded in traditional motives and patterns of behavior, it takes a very particular kind of person to catch the serial killer; someone who knows and understands the killer's dark side and the fantasies that plague him. Someone like the two lead characters- a police detective that is trying to understand her own mysterious personal connection in to the mind of a serial killer, and a &quot;profiler&quot; (forensic psychiatrist), who both in very different ways possess a deep psychological understanding that connects them to the killer's victims and to the killer himself, driving them to pursue each case to the end of the line, again and again.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defa89420bb119668ccff27875e349e1bc97dce9","amp;dn":"Those.Who.Kill.US.S01E04.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defa89420bb119668ccff27875e349e1bc97dce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,250,137,66,11,177,25,102,140,207,242,120,117,227,73,225,188,151,220,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
