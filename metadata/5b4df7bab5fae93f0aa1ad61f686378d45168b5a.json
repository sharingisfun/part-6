They cover all aspects of strategic endgames, with particular emphasis on thinking methods, and ways to create difficulties for opponents over the board.\n\nUsing hundreds of outstanding examples from modern practice, the authors explain not only how to conduct 'classical' endgame tasks, such as exploiting an extra pawn or more active pieces, but also how to handle the extremely unbalanced endings that often arise from the dynamic openings favoured nowadays. All varieties of endgames are covered, and there are more than 200 exercises for the reader, together with full solutions.\n\nMajor topics include:\n* Basic Principles and Methods\n* Activity\n* Schematic Thinking\n* The Fight for the Initiative\n* Prophylaxis and Preventing Counterplay\n* The Bishop-Pair in the Endgame\n* Domination\n* The Art of Defence\n* Typical Mistakes\n* Rules of Thumb\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Play-Chess-Endgames-Karsten-Muller/dp/1904600867/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344275389&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+play+chess+endgames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Play-Chess-Endgames-Karsten-Muller/dp/1904600867/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344275389&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+play+chess+endgames&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4df7bab5fae93f0aa1ad61f686378d45168b5a","amp;dn":"How+to+Play+Chess+Endgames","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4df7bab5fae93f0aa1ad61f686378d45168b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,77,247,186,181,250,233,63,10,161,173,97,246,134,55,141,69,22,139,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
