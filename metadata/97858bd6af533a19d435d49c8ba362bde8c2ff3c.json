After a bad run that included several divorces and irreconcilable sexual disharmony, the two are in danger of being banished to Earth. Their latest job, however, can save them. Their mission: bring together Robert Lewis (McGregor) and Celine Naville (Diaz).\n\nRobert is a dreaming, but hapless janitor, working for rich, spoiled, crazy Celine's father, Naville (Ian Holm). Robert finally snaps when he's fired, replaced by a robot, dumped by his girlfriend and sent an eviction notice (from the Firm But Fair Eviction &amp; Collection Agency, O'Reilly and Jackson's front). While demanding his job back from Naville, Robert shoots Naville in the leg (Celine distracted him) and takes Celine hostage. Robert, however, is an inept kidnapper. While making his ransom demand, he keeps making mistakes, like getting interrupted, dialing the wrong number and switching the main words (&quot;Right, daughter. I've got your asshole here.&quot;). O'Reilly and Jackson, meanwhile, disguise as bounty hunters and visit Naville. O'Reilly manages to sweet-talk herself and Jackson into the job of getting Robert and Celine back.\n\n\nBurn Tested!\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 39mn\nBit rate                         : 722 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.123\nStream size                      : 513 MiB (73%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio (MP3)\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 39mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nVideo delay                      : 26ms\nStream size                      : 182 MiB (26%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97858bd6af533a19d435d49c8ba362bde8c2ff3c","amp;dn":"A.Life.Less.Ordinary.%5BEwan.McGregor.Cameron.Diaz%5D.DvDRip.XviD.MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97858bd6af533a19d435d49c8ba362bde8c2ff3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,133,139,214,175,83,58,25,212,53,212,156,139,163,98,189,232,194,255,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
