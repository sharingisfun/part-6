Much better digital topo data, street names, etc. than previous v2002 Garmin US Topo product. This is my contribution in return for the Canada and US 24k Nat&amp;#039;l Parks Topo Maps, which I would never have been able to afford as I really needed only subsections of them! I hope this enables some geocachers somewhere to do some extra good hides!\n\nThis is in .nrg format. To burn the image file to DVD, you can use &quot;Burn Image to Disc&quot; feature in Nero, or you can mount directly using Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc. among other options.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844fbc8ac87071e393b63d4b0c309c8d66f3295e","amp;dn":"Garmin+MapSource+Topo+US+2008+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844fbc8ac87071e393b63d4b0c309c8d66f3295e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,79,188,138,200,112,113,227,147,182,61,75,12,48,156,141,102,243,41,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
