THE &quot;PIMSLEUR&quot; METHOD\n===============================================================================\nThe Pimsleur Method\n\nWhat is the Pimsleur difference?\n\nThe Pimsleur Method Provides the most effective language-learning program ever\ndeveloped.  The Pimsleur Method gives you quick command of a new language&amp;#039;s\nstructure without tedious drills.  Because of this, learning to speak becomes\nenjoyable and rewarding.\n\nThe Key reason most people struggle with new languages is that they aren&amp;#039;t\ngiven proper instruction - only bits and pieces of a language.  Other language\nprograms sell only pieces - dictionaries; grammar books and instructions; lists\nof hundreds or even thousands of words and definitions; audios containing\nuseless drills.  They leave it to you to assemble these pieces as you try to\nspeak.  Pimsleur enables you to spend your time learning to speak the language\nrather than just studying its parts.\n\nWhen you were learning English, could you speak before you knew how to\nconjugate verbs?  Of course you could!  That same learning process is what\nPimsleur replicates.  Pimsleur presents the whole language as one integrated\npiece so you can succeed.\n\nThe Pimsleur Method\n\nThe unique method developed by Dr. Paul Pimsleur lets you learn a language the\nway native speakers do - exposing you to vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation\nall at once, in everyday conversations.  And by applying Dr. Pimsleur&amp;#039;s two key\nproven principles - the Principle of Graduated Interval Recall and the\nPrinciple of Anticipation - this program delivers results faster and more\neffectively than any other language learning method, whether classroom or\npackaged.\n\n&quot;The Principle of Graduated Interval Recall&quot;\n\nIn his research, Dr Pimlseur discovered how long students remembered new\ninformation and at what intervals they needed to be reminded of it.  If\nreminded too soon or too late, they failed to retain the information.  This\ndiscovery enabled him to create a schedule of exactly when and how the\ninformation should be reintroduced.\n\nThis program is designed to remind you of new information at the exact\nintervals where maximum retention takes place.  Each time your memory begins to\nfade, you will be asked to recall the word.  Through this powerful method, your\nnew language skills move from short-term to long-term memory.\n\n&quot;The Principle of Anticipation&quot;\n\nBefore Dr. Pimsleur created his unique teaching method, language courses were\nbased on the principle of repetition.  Teachers drummed phrases into the\nstudents&amp;#039; minds over and over, as if language were made up only of words to be\nmemorized.  On the contrary, however, neurophysiologists tell us that simple\nand unchallenging repetition has a hypnotic, even dulling effect on the\nlearning process, completely counterproductive to actually learning a\nlanguage. Dr. Pimsleur discovered that learning accelerates when there is an\n&quot;input/output&quot; system of interaction, in which students receive information\nand then are later asked to retrieve and use it.\n\nThe Principle of Anticipation requires you to &quot;anticipate&quot; a correct answer.\nPractically, what this means is that you retrieve the answer from your memory\nbased on information provided in earlier lessons.\n\nPimsleur Results\n\nIn short, Pimsleur reinvents natural language acquisition - the way you\nlearned your native tongue - and applies it to second-language acquisition.\nAs sufficient structures and vocabulary are acquired, early reading is\nintroduced in those languages that employ a sound-based alphabet.  Learners\ncan then progress to see how word-sounds become written language. \n\nYou&amp;#039;ll have a broad repertoire of words, phrases, and sentences to choose from\nas you&amp;#039;re able to build longer sentences and have real interactive\nconversations with native speakers.  You&amp;#039;ll find yourself subconsciously\nthinking in your new language before you know it. You&amp;#039;ll be amazed at how\nquickly you begin to understand the words and begin to put sentences together\nin real conversations. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n==========================================================================[END]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6011a015bc9c9a4f2c987c18fa6f8ac08df2ddec","amp;dn":"Absolute+Pimsleur%5C%27s+Japanese+I+II+and+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6011a015bc9c9a4f2c987c18fa6f8ac08df2ddec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,17,160,21,188,156,154,79,44,152,124,24,250,111,138,192,141,242,221,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
