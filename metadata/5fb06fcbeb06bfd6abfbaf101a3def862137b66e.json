First, there's the choice of songs, like the opener, &quot;Killing Him,&quot; with LaVere sweetly singing that killing a love interest isn't enough to make the love go away. This, of course, wouldn't be very funny if a man sang it, but LaVere's straight reading and the melancholy fiddle accompaniment find the right balance. Paul Taylor's &quot;Pointless Drinking&quot; falls into a similar groove, a funny-sad song married to a '50s-style melody. The simple arrangements add to the album's left-of-center appeal, with steel guitars, fiddles, and guitars whipping up a lazy mixture that falls somewhere between old rock and country with perhaps a touch of jazz thrown in. At one moment, LaVere and company cover Tex-Mex (&quot;Overcome&quot;), the next, funky rock (&quot;People Get Mad&quot;). Even on a fairly straightforward song like &quot;That Beat,&quot; the band brings a carefree joy that commingles well with LaVere's torch singer vocal. Unlike many singer/songwriters, LaVere has pulled good songs from a variety of sources, and even when she borrows a song from a familiar figure like Bob Dylan, she borrows one of his lesser-known songs (&quot;I'll Remember You&quot;). Anchors &amp; Anvils' off-the-cuff qualities help separate the album from run-of-the-mill singer/songwriter product, and because of this, make LaVere more appealing than the average singer/songwriter..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb06fcbeb06bfd6abfbaf101a3def862137b66e","amp;dn":"Amy+LaVere+-+Anchors+and+Anvils+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC%2CLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb06fcbeb06bfd6abfbaf101a3def862137b66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,176,111,203,235,6,191,214,171,251,175,16,26,61,239,134,33,55,182,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
