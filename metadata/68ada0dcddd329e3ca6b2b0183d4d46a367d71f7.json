All available DLC\ncontent is unlocked. Check the included .txt file for a list of whats new.\n\n--\n\nAll it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the\nlatest gadgets and gear. We find out whats happening in the world. But with\nthat same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each\nconnection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and\nmilestone, our every like and dislike. And its not just people. Today, all\nmajor cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and\ncontrolled by complex operating systems.\n\nIn Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS)  and\nit controls almost every piece of the citys technology and holds key\ninformation on all of the citys residents.\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal\npast led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your\nfamily, youll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by\nmanipulating everything connected to the citys network. Access omnipresent\nsecurity cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control\ntraffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemyand more.\n\nUse the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of\nrevenge.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nHACK THE CITY\nWatch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your\nsmartphone, you have real-time control over the citys infrastructure. Trap\nyour enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a\ntrain, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by\nquickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the citys CTOS can\nbecome your weapon.\n\nSTREET JUSTICE\nLiving in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you\nhave the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by\ndelivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like\nnever before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter\ncategory. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any\ngiven situation. The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of\nattack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.\n\nHIGH OCTANE DRIVING\nUbisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the\nacclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game\nbursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each\nwith state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city\nwhile completing missions.\n\nEVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL\nDisrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced\nprocessing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly\nrealistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the\ncity and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple\neffect throughout the city.\n\nDYNAMIC NAVIGATION\nWatch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the citys ctOS to your\nadvantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through\nbuildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.\n\nSEAMLESS MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE\nDiscover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between\nplayers thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single\nand multiplayer modes into one seamless experience.
