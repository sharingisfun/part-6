The dedication is justified as \nNoumody - member of &quot;L'Ensemble National des Percussions de \nGuinÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e&quot; and  &quot;Les Ballets Africaines&quot; is known for his natural \ncharisma, his talent and his personality&quot;.\nBailo TÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©liwell Diallo\nDirecteur national de la Culture de la RÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©publique de GuinÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e \n(freely translated from the liner notes, Johannes Schya)\n\n\nNoumody Keita died too early on June, 22, 1995. The \nremarks about Noumody are, unfortunately, not translated.\n\n&quot;The Guinean percussionists rank among the best in West \nAfrica. The national ballets which came with the Marxist \nregime - &quot;Ballet Djoliba&quot; and &quot;Les Ballets Africaines&quot; - \nhave trained the djembe fola (djembe player in Maninka \nlanguage), of whom the most famous are Fadouba OlarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, \nFamoudou KonatÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, Mamady Keita, Noumody Keita, Gbanworo \nKeita, Aboubacar Fatouabou Camara, Laurent Camara and \nLamine Soumah. Some of them have passed away, the others \nare still active at the international scene.&quot;\nFrancois Kokelaere\n\n\nEach of the four ensembles is shortly introduced, a bit \ntoo short in my opinion: all names have been omitted, \nprobably to protect the innocent, with the exception of \nthe djembe folas mentioned in Kokelaere's introduction. \nSomething I don't like about this booklet is  the fact \nthat not a single musicians name is given with the track \nlist. The music is outstanding, no doubt, but who is \nplaying? \n\nThe only thing given with the tracks, is a little background \non the music. To give you an example, &quot;Koukou Beyla&quot; is \nintroduced as follows: \n\n&quot;The Koukou is danced for ceremonies and celebrations in \nthe region of Beyla, between the Highlands and the Forest \nregion&quot;. \n\nD'accord, but I've seen better liner notes from Budamusique \n(for example Famoudou KonatÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©'s CD from 1998.\n\nLet's talk about the music and forget the notes. The CD \ncombines four different ensembles and quite a lot of \ndifferent music. The recordings are, btw, live recordings, \nbut one can only guess the place, time or event  of the \nrecording; this is not a &quot;nice to have&quot; feature, but a must. \n\n\nThe sound quality is excellent and rather than describing \neach track, I just pick up the most impressive ones from \nmy point of view. \n\n&quot;Wassa&quot;, founded in 1988 by Marcire Camara are musically \nlocated in the coastal region of Guinea. All musicians \nbelong to the Sousou ethnic group. Both pieces are outstanding, \nas they are different from what I am familiar with:\n\n&quot;Borhomasi BarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©&quot; is the dance of a snake, played on bells - &quot;TÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶nyi&quot; \nin Sousou language. \n\n&quot;Tatami FarÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©&quot; is played on seven krin, or xylophone slit drums. \nThis is a truly contemporary percussion piece with a very \nstructured arrangement, where only the solos take on a freer form. \n(from the liner notes; our translation) \n... and it sounds terrific ! \n\nThere's nothing to say about &quot;Percussion de GuineÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©&quot;,  I guess everbody \nknows their style.\n\n&quot;Wofa&quot; is, according to the liner notes, the most original band in \nWest Africa. They are independent artists creating the  true spirit \nof the ballets, as initiated by Fodeba Keita; the musical focus \nonce more the coastal region of Guinea.\n\n&quot;WassakhoumbÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©&quot;\nBala, jembe and a very special rattle - wassakhumba sistrium - which \nrequires a specific wrist technique, are ingredients of another gem. \nI've never ever heard that kind of music before. \n\n&quot;Wofa GbÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©&quot;\nAnother interesting piece of music is played on  krin, rattle, bala, \ndunun and sikko. It starts very slow, before the music takes off.\n\n&quot;Les Ballets Africains&quot; have been touring the world for forty years \nand they combine the cultural heritage of the different Guinean \nregions: coast, Fouta Djellon, highlands and forest region.\n\n&quot;Celebration&quot;\nLet me call it a 20 minute piece of fireworks from another well \nknown group from GuineÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, a real &quot;tour de force&quot;, played in incredible \ntempi, but nevertheless enjoyable.\n\nTo summarize this new release from Budamusique:\n\nA must for every lover of West African music and another gem for \nevery collector, but  the liner notes could be significantly improved. \n\nJohannes Schya, September 1999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7097081701ec8aefa4a46b4f8bafa02695c6aa35","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Djembe+-+Percussions+D+Afrique+%28Guinea%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7097081701ec8aefa4a46b4f8bafa02695c6aa35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,151,8,23,1,236,138,239,164,164,107,79,139,175,160,38,149,198,170,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
