But what we are witnessing in Gaza is a modern-day genocide of the native people of Palestine on the hands of migrating Jewish settlers - the same crime that was committed against the native people of the Americas on the hands of the European settlers.\n\nWe have 30 titles here:\n\n-  Barrett - Geronimo; the True Story of America's Most Ferocious Warrior (2011)\n\n-  Beidler - Murdering Indians; a Documentary History of the 1897 Killings That Inspired Louise Erdich's The Plague of Doves (2014)\n\n-  Brumwell - White Devil; a True Story of War, Savagery, and Vengeance in Colonial America (2004)\n\n-  Carter &amp; McCormack (Eds.) - Recollecting; Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands (2011)\n\n-  Deloria - Indians of the Pacific Northwest from the Coming of the White Man to the Present Day (2012)\n\n-  Denetdale - The Long Walk; the Forced Navajo Exile (2008)\n\n-  Donovan - A Terrible Glory; Custer and the Little Bighorn; the Last Great Battle of the American West (2008)\n\n-  Drury &amp; Clavin - The Heart of Everything That Is; the Untold Story of Red Cloud, an American Legend (2013)\n\n-  Greene - Morning Star Dawn; the Powder River Expedition and the Northern Cheyennes, 1876 (2003)\n\n-  Grumet - First Manhattans; a History of the Indians of Greater New York (2011)\n\n-  Hemming - The Conquest of the Incas (1970)\n\n-  Iverson &amp; Davies - We Are Still Here; American Indians since 1890, 2e (2015)\n\n-  Jastrzembski - The Apache Wars; the Final Resistance (2007)\n\n-  Jones - The Conquest of the Last Maya Kingdom (1998)\n\n-  Jung - The Black Hawk War of 1832 (2007)\n\n-  King - The Inconvenient Indian; a Curious Account of Native People in North America (2012)\n\n-  MacQuarrie - The Last Days of the Incas (2007)\n\n-  Marsico - Perspectives on the Trail of Tears; the Tragedy of the American Indians (2010)\n\n-  Miller - The Force Removal of American Indians from the Northeast; a History of Territorial Cessions and Relocations, 1620-1854 (2011)\n\n-  Prescott - History of the Conquest of Mexico (2001)\n\n-  Preston - The Texture of Contact; European and Indian Settler Communities on the Frontiers of Iroquoia, 1667-1783 (2009)\n\n-  Rielly - Legends of American Indian Resistance (2011)\n\n-  Robertson - Conquest by Law; How the Discovery of America Dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of Their Lands (2005)\n\n-  Robins - Native Insurgencies and the Genocidal Impulse in the Americas (2005)\n\n-  Russell et al - The Cherokees, Indian of the Souteast; a Population History (1990)\n\n-  Sonneborn - Chronology of American Indian History (2007)\n\n-  Stevens - The Poor Indians; British Missionaries, Native Americans, and Colonial Sensibility (2004)\n\n-  Stewart (Ed.) - Blood in the Hills; a History of Violence in Appalachia (2012)\n\n-  Sugden - Blue Jacket; Warrior of the Shawnees (2000)\n\n-  West - The Last Indian War; the Nez Perce Story (2009)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee493b3913a6f35e9cf54325e4717b8f522c3bfa","amp;dn":"Sins+of+Colonialism+-+Collection+9+%28..+in+the+Americas+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee493b3913a6f35e9cf54325e4717b8f522c3bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,73,59,57,19,166,243,94,156,245,67,37,228,113,123,143,82,44,59,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
