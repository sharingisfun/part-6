It appears sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been murdered, mere weeks before the trial of her $100 million lawsuit against her former financial managers, and Scarpetta doubts itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a coincidence. She also fears the case may have a connection with her computer genius niece, Lucy.\n\nAt a glance there is no sign of what killed Gail Shipton, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s covered with a fine dust that under ultraviolet light fluoresces brilliantly in three vivid colors, what Scarpetta calls a mineral fingerprint. Clearly the body has been posed with chilling premeditation that is symbolic and meant to shock, and Scarpetta has reason to worry that the person responsible is the Capital Murderer, whose most recent sexual homicides have terrorized Washington, D.C. Stunningly, Scarpetta will discover that her FBI profiler husband, Benton Wesley, is convinced that certain people in the government, including his boss, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want the killer caught. \n\nIn Dust, Scarpetta and her colleagues are up against a force far more sinister than a sexual predator who fits the criminal classification of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“spectacle killer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The murder of Gail Shipton soon leads deep into the dark world of designer drugs, drone technology, organized crime, and shocking corruption at the highest levels.\n\nWith unparalleled high-tension suspense and the latest in forensic technology, Patricia Cornwell once again proves her exceptional ability to surpriseÃ¢â‚¬â€and to thrill.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a77d3a0869377fad1770c26ebb8df12ec59b64b","amp;dn":"Dust+by+Patricia+Cornwell+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a77d3a0869377fad1770c26ebb8df12ec59b64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,119,211,160,134,147,119,250,209,119,12,38,235,184,223,18,236,89,182,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
