That's always been true. The Others didn't invent death; they just perfected it. Gave death a face to put back in our face, because they knew that was the only way to crush us. It won't end on any continent or ocean, no mountain or plain, jungle or desert. It will end where it began, where it had been from the beginning: on the battlefield of the last beating human heart.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nThe enemy is Other. The enemy is us. They're down here, they're up there, they're nowhere. They want the Earth, they want us to have it. They came to wipe us out, they came to save us.\r\n\r\nBut beneath these riddles lies one truth: Cassie has been betrayed. So has Ringer. Zombie. Nugget. And all 7.5 billion people who used to live on our planet. Betrayed first by the Others and now by ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn these last days, Earth's remaining survivors will need to decide what's more important: saving themselves...or saving what makes us human.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Phoebe Strole, Ben Yannette\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c17bd2db69abdf1c7002c068f7e0f3583e472c","amp;dn":"Rick+Yancey+-+The+Last+Star+%28The+5th+Wave+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c17bd2db69abdf1c7002c068f7e0f3583e472c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,193,123,210,219,105,171,223,28,112,2,192,104,247,224,243,88,62,71,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
