Of course, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Johnson is, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s avoided sounding that way by performing soft-shuffle acoustic numbers, camouflaging his pop move as a soundtrack to Curious George, then getting mellowly introspective on 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Sleep Through the Static. To the Sea blows away the drowsy cobwebs from Sleep, pushing the acoustic guitar to the background and letting his band groove politely, usually in an amiable, unhurried gait that never breaks a sweat even when the musicians goose the tempo a bit. Call it the signature of a surfer so bleached by the sun that he rushes nothing, but To the Sea substitutes the sunset strum-alongs of his earliest records for a sleek daytime sheen that might glimmer too brightly for hippies but it makes for a better overall pop record, the kind of album that suits Jack JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stature as surfer turned AAA crooner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd2bcdebbf3d79d9cdcad9100954e5095e5c16c8","amp;dn":"Jack+Johnson+-+To+the+Sea+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd2bcdebbf3d79d9cdcad9100954e5095e5c16c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,43,205,235,191,61,121,217,205,202,217,16,9,84,229,9,94,92,22,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
