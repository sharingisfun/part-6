Similar to fellow Chicago residents Pelican, Russian     \n Circles play epic, sprawling music which runs the gamut of heavy  \n discordant metal, to soft delicate passages. They are also known  \n for their energetic live shows, which include tours with Minus the\n Bear, Chin Up Chin Up, Mono, and Pelican as well as an appearance \n at the 2006 SXSW.                                                 \n                                                                   \n Formed in late 2004 by guitarist Mike Sullivan and bassist Colin  \n DeKuiper (both formerly of another instrumental band              \n Dakota/Dakota) they quickly recruited Dave Turncrantz, formerly of\n St. Louis band Riddle of Steel.                                   \n                                                                   \n When performing live, the band is noted for being able to         \n replicate and even expand upon their recorded material through    \n Sullivan and DeKuiper&amp;#039;s use of sampling and loop pedals.          \n                                                                   \n In the autumn of 2007, it was announced that the band had parted  \n ways with Colin DeKuiper. As a result, the bass tracks on their   \n new album, titled Station, will be handled by ex-Botch/These Arms \n Are Snakes bass player Brian Cook.                                \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84cc06c5faccdb8adeb59ecea38a40b322830893","amp;dn":"Russian+Circles+-+Enter+%282006%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84cc06c5faccdb8adeb59ecea38a40b322830893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,204,6,197,250,204,219,138,222,181,158,206,163,138,64,179,34,131,8,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
