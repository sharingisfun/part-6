Charles Mingus consciously designed the six-part ballet as his magnum \n\nopus, and -- implied in his famous inclusion of liner notes by his psychologist -- it's as much an \n\nexamination of his own tortured psyche as it is a conceptual piece about love and struggle. It \n\nveers between so many emotions that it defies easy encapsulation; for that matter, it can be \n\ndifficult just to assimilate in the first place. Yet the work soon reveals itself as a masterpiece \n\nof rich, multi-layered texture and swirling tonal colors, manipulated with a painter's attention \n\nto detail. There are a few stylistic reference points -- Ellington, the contemporary avant-garde, \n\nseveral flamenco guitar breaks -- but the totality is quite unlike what came before it. Mingus \n\nrelies heavily on the timbral contrasts between expressively vocal-like muted brass, a rumbling \n\nmass of low voices (including tuba and baritone sax), and achingly lyrical upper woodwinds, \n\nhighlighted by altoist Charlie Mariano. Within that framework, Mingus plays shifting rhythms, \n\nmoaning dissonances, and multiple lines off one another in the most complex, interlaced fashion \n\nhe'd ever attempted. Mingus was sometimes pigeonholed as a firebrand, but the personal exorcism of \n\nBlack Saint deserves the reputation -- one needn't be able to follow the story line to hear the \n\nsuffering, mourning, frustration, and caged fury pouring out of the music. The 11-piece group \n\nrehearsed the original score during a Village Vanguard engagement, where Mingus allowed the \n\nplayers to mold the music further; in the studio, however, his exacting perfectionism made The \n\nBlack Saint and the Sinner Lady the first jazz album to rely on overdubbing technology. The result \n\nis one of the high-water marks for avant-garde jazz in the '60s and arguably Mingus' most \n\nbrilliant moment.\n\nLink:\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:rfud6j477180\n\n1 - 6:39 - Track A - Solo Dancer\n2 - 6:47 - Track B - Duet Solo Dancers\n3 - 7:25 - Track C - Group Dancers\n4 - 18:41 - Mode D - Trio and Group Dancers / \n            Mode E - Single Solos and Group Dance / \n\t    Mode F - Group and Solo Dance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96780815d356611eed303b6b3ba40353a8b539df","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+-+The+Black+Saint+and+the+Sinner+Lady+%5B1963%5D+%28EAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96780815d356611eed303b6b3ba40353a8b539df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,120,8,21,211,86,97,30,237,48,59,107,59,164,3,83,168,181,57,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
