One such artist was Jim Croce, a songwriter with a knack for both upbeat, catchy singles and empathetic, melancholy ballads. Though Croce only recorded a few studio albums before an untimely plane crash, he continues to be remembered posthumously. Croce appealed to fans as a common man, and it was not a gimmick -- he was a father and husband who went through a series of blue-collar jobs. And whether he used dry wit, gentle emotions, or sorrow, Croce sang with a rare form of honesty and power. Few artists have ever been able to pull off such down-to-earth storytelling as convincingly as he was. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\t21 Records\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\n02.Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)\n03.Photographs And Memories\n04.Rapid Roy (The Stock Car Boy)\n05.Time In A Bottle\n06.New York's Not My Home\n07.Workin' At The Car Wash Blues\n08.I Got A Name\n09.I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song\n10.You Don't Mess Around With Jim\n11.Lover's Cross\n12.One Less Set Of Footsteps\n13.These Dreams\n14.Roller Derby Queen\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21e95d48995da3b7c5ca6acf61305c784194a3a","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+-+Photographs+%26+Memories+%281974%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21e95d48995da3b7c5ca6acf61305c784194a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,30,149,212,137,149,218,59,124,92,166,172,246,19,5,199,132,25,74,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
