Schools across the United States, as well as 15 other countries, use this text and accompanying training handbook to help train teachers to negotiate classroom problems.\n\nThis book helps real teachers deal more effectively with administration, parents, substitute or cluster teaching, bullying, creating a safe classroom environment, and with students who demonstrate a variety of behavioral problems. The author, Howard Seeman, demonstrates how to handle and prevent these various situations. Included in each chapter are self-training, hands-on practice exercises and helpful guidelines and checklists to assist the beginning or veteran teacher.\n\nOnline course and a live-action training DVD are available.
