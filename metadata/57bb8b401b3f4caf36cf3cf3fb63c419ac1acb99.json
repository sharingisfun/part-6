This second edition strives to capture the advances occurring in the etiology, prevention, and treatment of cancer, from basic science to clinical application. By providing concise expositions on a broad range of topics, the Encyclopedia is an excellent resource for those seeking information beyond their specific areas of expertise. Written by a distinguished panel of authors, entries cover a variety of aspects of cancer such as oncology, immunology, epidemiology, gene therapy, oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes, and pharmacology. This outstanding reference is essential for anyone involved in the study or treatment of cancer. \n\nKey Features\n\n* Covers all aspects of cancer, segueing from basic science to clinical topics\n* Includes an additional volume to incorporate all the new advances in the etiology, prevention, and treatment of cancer made since the first edition\n* Convenient organization employs standard entry format for quick and easy reference\n* Extensive cross-referencing provides reader with broader range of knowledge\n* Contributions solicited from among the top names in a variety of fields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPublisher: Springer; 2nd edition (October 1, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3540476490\nISBN-13: 978-3540476498\n\nThis comprehensive encyclopedic reference provides rapid access to focused information on topics of cancer research for clinicians, research scientists and advanced students. Given the overwhelming success of the first edition, which appeared in 2001, and fast development in the different fields of cancer research, it has been decided to publish a second fully revised and expanded edition. With an A-Z format of over 7,000 entries, more than 1,000 contributing authors provide a complete reference to cancer. The merging of different basic and clinical scientific disciplines towards the common goal of fighting cancer makes such a comprehensive reference source all the more timely.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPublisher: Springer; 3rd ed. 2012 edition (September 23, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 364216482X\nISBN-13: 978-3642164828\n\nThe merging of different basic and clinical science disciplines towards the common goal of fighting against cancer has long ago called for the establishment of a comprehensive reference source both as a tool to close the language gap between clinical and basic science investigators and as a platform of information for students and informed laymen alike. The Encyclopedia of Cancer provides rapid access to focused information on all topics of cancer research for clinicians, research scientists and advanced students. Given the overwhelming success of the Second Edition, which appeared in 2009, and fast recent development in the different fields of cancer research, it has been decided to publish a third fully revised and expanded edition, following the principal concept of the first edition that has proven so successful.\n\nRecent developments are seeing a dynamic progress in basic and clinical cancer science, with translational research increasingly becoming a new paradigm in cancer research. In particular, new approaches to both Personalized Cancer Medicine and Targeted Therapies have made promising progress. While the Second Edition featured scholarly contributions from approximately 1.000 scientists/clinicians in four Volumes, the Third Edition includes 1.300 contributors in 7 Volumes with an A-Z format of approx. 7000 entries. It provides definitions of common acronyms and short definitions of related terms and processes in the form of keyword entries. In addition, there are detailed essays, which provide comprehensive information on syndromes, genes and molecules, and processes and methods. Each essay is well-structured, with extensive cross-referencing between all entries. In the Third Edition, topical Essays present a comprehensive picture of major cancers, such as Breast Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Renal Cancer, Lung Cancer, and Hematological Maligancies, Leukemias and Lymphomas. For each of these cancers, different authoritative Essays are included that cover topics ranging from Pathology, to Clinical Oncology and Targeted Therapies. This new feature should meet the expectance that a wide community has towards a major cancer reference works.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Cancer will be accessible both in print and online, and this information source should be of value to both the clinical and basic scientific community as well as to the public","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57bb8b401b3f4caf36cf3cf3fb63c419ac1acb99","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Cancer+-+2nd+%28Revised%29+and+3rd+Ed+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57bb8b401b3f4caf36cf3cf3fb63c419ac1acb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,187,139,64,27,63,76,175,54,207,60,243,251,99,196,25,172,26,203,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
