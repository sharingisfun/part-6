Vaughan and Fiona Staples described as Romeo and Juliet meets Star Wars meets Game of Thrones. In 2013, Saga won three Eisner Awards for Best Writing, Best New Series, and Best Continuing Series.\n\n&quot;This is an original fantasy book with no superheroes, two non-white leads and an opening chapter featuring graphic robot sex. I thought we might be cancelled by our third issue.&quot; - Brian K.
