Now, quantum mechanics promises that some of humanity's wildest dreams may be realized. Serious scientists, working from Einstein's theories, have been investigating the phenomenon known as &quot;entanglement,&quot; one of the strangest aspects of our strange universe. According to Einstein, quantum mechanics required entanglement Ã¢â‚¬â€ the idea that subatomic particles could become linked, and that a change to one such particle would instantly be reflected in its counterpart, even if separated by a universe. Einstein felt that if quantum theory could produce such bizarre effects, then it had to be invalid. But new experiments show that not only does it happen, but that it may lead to unbreakable codes, and even teleportation, perhaps in our lifetime.\n\nHardcover: 320 pages\nPublisher: Basic Books; First Edition edition (September 18, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1568582323\nISBN-13: 978-1568582320\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
