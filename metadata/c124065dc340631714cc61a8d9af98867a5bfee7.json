The releases were mostly singles and EPs or part of a various artists underground compilation. The bands are referred to as DIY, or do-it-yourself. Although the songs are generally quite likeable, they were too dark, arty and experimental for pop-oriented Rare Hits of The 80s series, so I skipped them while making those series. Then since they are not synth-dominated, quirky and danceable tracks, I did not pick them for This Is What I call Minimal 80s series either. However this style of music definitely has its own audience and deserves some recognition. More likely than not, some of these tracks are on some people's wish list. So I'd be posting them in a few instalments if I see thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest. \n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Last Four (4) Digits - Fast Friends \n02 Kevin Dunn &amp; The Regiment Of Women - Oktyabrina\n03 Manic Leisure - Miro\n04 Vertical Motion - You've Lost The Thread\n05 Surplus Stock - Take It\n06 Delmontes - Don't Cry Your Tears\n07 Touch Tones - Sorry We're Passe \n08 IQ Zero - Crazy Dolls \n09 Von Beat - Of Course I Care \n10 The Point Fives - Next Time\n11 Take It -Trends and Relations\n12 F-Systems - People \n13 The Cubs - A Dance To Forget \n14 Kate Fagan - Waiting For The Crisis \n15 Westside Lockers - Song for America \n16 Motifs - Cameras\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c124065dc340631714cc61a8d9af98867a5bfee7","amp;dn":"Obscure+80s+Post-Punk%2C+Experimental%2C+Art+Rock+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c124065dc340631714cc61a8d9af98867a5bfee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,36,6,93,195,64,99,23,20,204,97,168,217,175,152,134,122,91,254,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
