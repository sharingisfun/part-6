Then simply plug the card into your computer\\'s card reader to start planning your voyage.\n\nNavigating waters with no visible landmarks or shallow shorelines can be a daunting task for even the most experienced navigator. With your existing BlueChart data together with HomePort on your computer, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have the ability to view map details such as underwater hazards and hidden obstacles and plan a route to avoid them.\n\nHomePort also offers features such as depth profiles, distance and bearing measurements, and tidal predictions.\nManage Your Data\n\nIn addition to managing waypoints, routes and tracks, you can store information from past voyages right on your computer. HomePort also will help you create point-to-point routes, determine fuel usage and estimate your travel time for each leg of your route ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ saving you time and money.\nView Marine Charts\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to browse and view chart detail on your computer screen and mark waypoints and other points of interest. When finished, send the data to an SD card or proprietary Garmin datacard to load into your compatible Garmin chartplotter or sounder.\n\nHomePort is compatible with BlueChart, BlueChart g2 and BlueChart g2 VisionÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® navigation charts. Currently, it is only compatible with WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® operating systems.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹HomePort software does not include map data.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²Inland Lakes software is not compatible with HomePort.
