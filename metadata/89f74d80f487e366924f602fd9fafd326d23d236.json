Company research is rigged, alarming evidence of health dangers is covered up, and intense political pressure applied. Chapters read like adventure stories and are hard to put down:\n\n- Scientists were offered bribes or threatened. Evidence was stolen. Data was omitted or distorted.\n- Government employees who complained were harassed, stripped of responsibilities, or fired.\n- Laboratory rats fed a GM crop developed stomach lesions and seven of the forty died within two weeks. The crop was approved without further tests.\n- The only independent in-depth feeding study ever conducted showed evidence of alarming health dangers. When the scientist tried to alert the public, he lost his job and was silenced with threats of a lawsuit.\n\nRead the actual internal memos by FDA scientists, warning of toxins, allergies, and new diseases - all ignored by their superiors, including a former attorney for Monsanto. Learn why the FDA withheld information from Congress after a genetically modified supplement killed nearly a hundred people and disabled thousands.\n\n\nDVD 1: Unnatural Selection (retitled &quot;Life Running Out of Control&quot; + extras)\n\nThis stunning, award-winning documentary by Bertram Verhaag and Gabriele KrÃƒÂ·ber reveals harsh consequences of genetic engineering on three continents. Vandana Shiva, Andrew Kimbrell, Percy Schmeiser and others, describe uncontrollable, self-replicating GM contamination, failed crops, farmer suicides, and new GM animals that threaten natural populations. This stunning European documentary made available for the first time in the US, reveals several harsh consequences of genetic engineering worldwide. A failed GM cotton crop prompts farmer suicides in India. Windborne GM canola contaminates organic and conventional farms in Canada. One farmer fights Monsanto in the Supreme Court. A company seeks approval for giant GM salmon that may threaten the survival of the natural species. GM pigs are born with ghastly mutations. And experts reveal how inadequate testing and regulations put us at risk. It features Vandana Shiva, Andrew Kimbrell, Percy Schmeiser and others.\n\n\nDVD 2: Hidden Dangers in Kids Meals: Genetically Engineered Foods (+ Extras)\n\nShocking research results, inadequate regulations and warnings from eminent scientists explain why GM foods are dangerous and should be removed from kids&amp;#039; meals. The dramatic story of how student behavior in a Wisconsin school was transformed with a healthy diet provides added motivation to make a change. It features Jeffrey Smith and more than a dozen scientists and experts.\n\n\nAUDIO CD: You&amp;#039;re Eating What?\n\nJeffrey Smith, author of the world&amp;#039;s bestselling book on GM foods, Seeds of Deception, describes how biotech companies rigged research, hid health dangers and pressured government regulators to approve food that even FDA scientists said was unsafe.\n\n\nComment:\nThank-you itbg4000 for ripping and encoding. Due to limited BW I received the files in mail on DVD and am doing the release with my BW.\n\n\nDVD 1: Unnatural Selection is actually the same as &quot;Life Running Out Of Control&quot; plus some new extras. Although the encode quality is better then any copy of &quot;Life Running Out Of Control&quot; I have found online, so worth the grab even if you have already.\n\nAll cover and disc art is included, a great info package, enjoy :D\n\nConCen Tracker - http://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html\nConCen Forum - http://conspiracycentral.info/index.php?act=idx\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName...................: DVD #1 Unnatural Selection, GMO Trilogy\nFilesize...............: Main Film + extras = 814 MB\nRuntime................: Main Film = 59:56 Extras = 50:00\nVideo Codec............: All Divx (BVOP &amp; NVOP)\nVideo Bitrate..........: Main Film &amp; Extras = 904kbps\nAudio Codec............: All MP3\nAudio Bitrate..........: All 128 kbps 2.0\nFrame Size.............: Main Film = 512x288 16:9 Extras = 512x384 4:3\n========================================\nName...................: DVD #2\n-01.
