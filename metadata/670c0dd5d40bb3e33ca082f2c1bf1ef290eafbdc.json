Each book in the series offers a concise yet cogent introduction to a particular subject. Written by acknowledged experts, most books are between 100ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“150 pages and contain suggestions for further reading. Authors often present personal viewpoints, but each introduction is intended to be balanced and complete.&quot; (Wikipedia)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/general/vsi.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/general/vsi.do&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is a collection of 158 books from the series that currently numbers 245 titles.
