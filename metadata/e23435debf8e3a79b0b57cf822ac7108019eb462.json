TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Gabe, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making one particular fantasy come true with a woman who was forbidden fruit. Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ripe for the picking...\n\nWhen Gabe Hamilton saw Mia Crestwell walk into the ballroom for his hotelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand opening, he knew he was going to hell for what he had planned. After all, Mia is his best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little sister. Except sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.\n\nGabe has starred in MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. So what if GabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourteen years older? Mia knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an adult now, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason not to act on her most secret desires.\n\nAs Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposedÃ¢â‚¬â€and vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.\n\nFever (Breathless #2) by Maya Banks \nJace, Ash, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all.

TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re powerful, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re imposing, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re irresistibly sexy, and Jace and Ash share everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€including their women.\n\nWhen they meet Bethany, Jace begins to feel things heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never experienced before: jealousy, and a powerful obsession that threatens him, overwhelms himÃ¢â‚¬â€and excites him beyond control.\n\nJace isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sharing BethanyÃ¢â‚¬â€with anyone. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to be the only man in her life, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jeopardizing a lifelong friendship with Ash. Bethany will be his and his alone. Even if it means turning his back on his best friend.\n\nBurn (Breathless #3) by Maya Banks\nAsh, Jace, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country.

For Ash, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the woman who changes everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known about dominance and desire... \n\nWhen it comes to sex, Ash McIntyre has always explored his wilder sideÃ¢â‚¬â€extreme and uncompromising. He demands control. And he prefers women who want it like that. Even the women heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shared with his best friend, Jace. \n\nBut Jace is involved with a woman he has no intention of sharing. And now even Gabe has settled into a relationship with a woman who gives him everything he needs, leaving Ash feeling restless and unfulfilled. \n\nThen Ash meets Josie, who seems immune to his charms and his wealth. Intrigued, he begins a relentless pursuit, determined she wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the one who got away. He never imagined the one woman to tell him no would be the only woman whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever drive him to the edge of desire.\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23435debf8e3a79b0b57cf822ac7108019eb462","amp;dn":"The+Breathless+Trilogy+by+Maya+Banks+%5BMU%5D+%7BSRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23435debf8e3a79b0b57cf822ac7108019eb462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,52,53,222,191,142,58,121,176,181,124,248,34,172,113,8,1,158,180,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
