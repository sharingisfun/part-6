In this book he turns his attention to providing a simple way of thinking about practical problems. To make problem-solving easier, Dr. de Bono puts forward a visual 'flowscape' which is very simple to construct and which allows us to see at a glance the important points and relationships.\r\n\r\nThis 'flowscape' is based on the water logic proposed by Dr. de Bono. Traditional 'rock logic' is based on identity: &quot;What isâ€¦..?' 'Water logic' is based on 'flow': 'What does this lead to?' If you want to simplify you thinking about complex issues, you need this book. - Penguin synopsis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:996c62472d177ff14e64b261ca9583b6d6ff3fdb","amp;dn":"Edward+De+Bono-+Water+Logic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"996c62472d177ff14e64b261ca9583b6d6ff3fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,108,98,71,45,23,127,241,78,100,178,97,202,149,131,182,214,255,63,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
