For both historical mystery writers and readers.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\nEmerson, author of the Lady Appleton and Diana Spaulding mystery series, turns her hand to how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done in this useful guide to writing historical crime fiction. Drawing on her own works and those of her fellow historical-mystery writers (Kerry Greenwood, Alan Gordon, Carola Dunn, and others), she lays out, in commonsense sequence, the stages of planning and writing a historical mystery. Chapters on choosing setting and character, research, crafting a plot, and selling your book offer much of the same information as similar chapters in other how-to books for mystery writers, but the information is nicely tailored for this particular genre. Published writers probably wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find much here that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already know, but budding historical novelists will discover a wealth of helpful tips and may want to keep a notebook handy to jot them down. The book finds its niche and fills it well. --David Pitt\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“...a comprehensive guide, full of seasoned advice and rich examples.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- Hallie Ephron, author of Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine a question about historical mysteries that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t answered here. Do not start writing your historical mystery without this book!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- Carolyn Wheat, author of How To Write Killer Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323755a145821cc77e14799065b2204b4e655341","amp;dn":"How+to+Write+Killer+Historical+Mysteries+-+Kathy+Lynn+Emerson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323755a145821cc77e14799065b2204b4e655341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,55,85,161,69,130,28,199,126,20,121,144,101,178,32,75,78,101,83,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
