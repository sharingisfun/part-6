None of the three influences overwhelms the others on 1967's Juicy, although from the lubricious title and cover photo on down, there's a certain &quot;swingin' at Hef's pad&quot; vibe to the proceedings that makes this album of particular interest to latter-day hipsters.  Most of the song selection consists of soul-jazz covers of popular hits of the day, from a funky take on Eddie Floyd's &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; to a bossa nova-fied version of Bob Crewe's &quot;Music to Watch Girls By,&quot; but the real standouts are the small handful of band originals, particularly the fiery groove of the title track, on which Bobo's timbales get their hardest workout.  The 1998 CD reissue includes a full half-dozen extras, mostly less-than-revelatory alternate takes and leftovers, but the restored full-length version of the swell &quot;La Descarga del Bobo&quot; is a nice touch. ~ Stewart Mason, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nWillie Bobo (Timbales and Vocals) \nMelvin Lastie (Cornet) \nBobby Brown (Alto and Tenor Saxophone) \nSonny Henry (Guitar) \nothers unknown \n\nWillie Bobo - Juicy Tracks:\n01  Knock On Wood (Steve Cropper/Eddie Floyd) 2:43 \n02  Mating Call (Bert Keyes) 3:08 \n03  Mercy, Mercy, Mercy (Gail Levy/Vincent Levy/Joe Zawinul) 2:37 \n04  Felicidad (Clarence Henry) 3:20 \n05  La Descarga Del Bobo (William Correa) 5:41 \n06  Juicy (Mike Stoller) 2:29 \n07  Ain't To Proud To Beg (Eddie Holland/Norman Whitfield) 2:45 \n08  Music To Watch Girls By (Sid Ramin) 2:22 \n09  Dreams (Bobby Valentin) 3:26 \n10  Dis-Advantages (M.
