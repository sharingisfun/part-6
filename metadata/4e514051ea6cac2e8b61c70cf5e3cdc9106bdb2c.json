S. Naipaul returned to India, the country his ancestors had left one hundred years earlier. Out of that journey he produced this concise masterpiece: a vibrant, defiantly unsentimental portrait of a society traumatized by centuries of foreign conquest and immured in a mythic vision of its past.\n\nDrawing on novels, news reports, political memoirs, and his own encounters with ordinary IndiansÃ¢â‚¬â€œfrom a supercilious prince to an engineer constructing housing for BombayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homelessÃ¢â‚¬â€œNaipaul captures a vast, mysterious, and agonized continent inaccessible to foreigners and barely visible to its own people. He sees both the burgeoning space program and the 5,000 volunteers chanting mantras to purify a defiled temple; the feudal village autocrat and the Naxalite revolutionaries who combined Maoist rhetoric with ritual murder. Relentless in its vision, thrilling in the keenness of its prose, India: A Wounded Civilization is a work of astonishing insight and candor.\n\nFrom the Trade Paperback edition.\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Extraordinarily forceful. . . .
