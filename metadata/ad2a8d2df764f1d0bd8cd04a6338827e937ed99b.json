A one-stop resource for quantitative risk analysis, Practical Spreadsheet Risk Modeling for Management dispenses with the use of complex mathematics, concentrating on how powerful techniques and methods can be used correctly within a spreadsheet-based environment.\n\nHighlights\n-Covers important topics for modern risk analysis, such as frequency-severity modeling and modeling of expert opinion\n-Keeps mathematics to a minimum while covering fairly advanced topics through the use of powerful software tools\n-Contains an unusually diverse selection of topics, including explicit treatment of frequency-severity modeling, copulas, parameter and model uncertainty, volatility modeling in time series, Markov chains, Bayesian modeling, stochastic dominance, and extended treatment of modeling expert opinion\n-End-of-chapter exercises span eight application areas illustrating the broad application of risk analysis tools with the use of data from real-world examples and case studies\n\nThis book is written for anyone interested in conducting applied risk analysis in business, engineering, environmental planning, public policy, medicine, or virtually any field amenable to spreadsheet modeling. The authors provide practical case studies along with detailed instruction and illustration of the features of ModelRiskÃ‚Â®, the most advanced risk modeling spreadsheet software currently available. If you intend to use spreadsheets for decision-supporting analysis, rather than merely as placeholders for numbers, then this is the resource for you.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConceptual Maps and Models\nIntroductory Case: Mobile Phone Service\nFirst Steps: Visualization\nRetirement Planning Example\nGood Practices with Spreadsheet Model Construction\nErrors in Spreadsheet Modeling\nConclusion: Best Practices\n\nBasic Monte Carlo Simulation in Spreadsheets\nIntroductory Case: Retirement Planning\nRisk and Uncertainty\nScenario Manager\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nMonte Carlo Simulation Using ModelRisk\nMonte Carlo Simulation for Retirement Planning\nDiscrete Event Simulation\n\nModeling with Objects\nIntroductory Case: An Insurance Problem\nFrequency and Severity\nObjects\nUsing Objects in the Insurance Model\nModeling Frequency/Severity without Using Objects\nModeling Deductibles\nUsing Objects without Simulation\nMultiple Severity/Frequency Distributions\nUncertainty and Variability\n\nSelecting Distributions\nFirst Introductory Case: Valuation of a Public CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â€Using Expert Opinion\nModeling Expert Opinion in the Valuation Model\nSecond Introductory Case: Value at RiskÃ¢â‚¬â€Fitting\nDistributions to Data\nDistribution Fitting for VaR, Parameter Uncertainty, and Model Uncertainty\nCommonly Used Discrete Distributions\nCommonly Used Continuous Distributions\nA Decision Guide for Selecting Distributions\nBayesian Estimation\n\nModeling Relationships\nFirst Example: Drug Development\nSecond Example: Collateralized Debt Obligations\nMultiple Correlations\nThird Example: How Correlated Are Home Prices?Ã¢â‚¬â€Copulas\nEmpirical Copulas\nFourth Example: Advertising Effectiveness\nRegression Modeling\nSimulation within Regression Models\nMultiple Regression Models\nThe Envelope Method\nSummary\n\nTime Series Models\nIntroductory Case: September 11 and Air Travel\nThe Need for Time Series Analysis: A Tale of Two Series\nAnalyzing the Air Traffic Data\nSecond Example: Stock Prices\nTypes of Time Series Models\nThird Example: Oil Prices\nFourth Example: Home Prices and Multivariate Time Series.\nMarkov Chains\n\nOptimization and Decision Making\nIntroductory Case: Airline Seat Pricing\nA Simulation Model of the Airline Pricing Problem\nA Simulation Table to Explore Pricing Strategies\nAn Optimization Solution to the Airline Pricing Problem\nOptimization with Simulation\nOptimization with Multiple Decision Variables\nAdding Requirements\nPresenting Results for Decision Making\nStochastic Dominance\n\nAppendix A: Monte Carlo Simulation Software\nIntroduction\nA Brief Tour of Four Monte Carlo Packages\nIndex\n\n\nAuthor Bio(s)\nDale Lehman is Professor of Economics and Director of the MBA Program at Alaska Pacific University.
