Geoff Burton ( The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting, Wide Sargasso Sea ) condenses his many years of location lighting experience in this highly practical and useful workshop. Geoff's approach emphasizes maximum use of natural lighting resources ( daylight and practical ) and imitating these sources with the light he adds. Geoff shows how to work with the limitations of locations space and design ( in this case three rooms of a cramped apartment ) rather than against them. He demonstrates how fast stocks and fast work can be critical to success.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a844ef1d1abb513d01240622e70b248ef64a820b","amp;dn":"Kodak+Cinematography+Masterclass+-+Location+Lighting+with+Geoff+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a844ef1d1abb513d01240622e70b248ef64a820b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,68,239,29,26,187,81,61,1,36,6,34,231,11,36,142,246,74,130,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
