They are chronicles celebrating past achievements in hopes of promoting future collections.\nThis LRB collection focuses on their 70s output and with two exceptions (THE OTHER GUY and DOWN ON THE BORDER) spotlights the Shorrock-Birtles-Goble era...and a fine era it was. My review is for the original 12-track edition.\nLRB, my favorite pop-rock band, is noted for their impeccable vocal harmonies and expert musicianship. Especially notable, too, is bassist/vocalist Wayne Nelson's consistent presence throughout their many transformations. And of course John Farnham who led the band into the 80s with a distinctive and excellent change.\nWhat can one say about these 12 tunes that are exemplary of LRB's incomparable sound. Just that each song is simply amazing. LRB is truly a name synonymous with the best in contemporary pop music\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: \nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1982\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 59 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
