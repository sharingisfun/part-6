All of the featured artists are seasoned instructors who understand that the joy of painting comes not only from creating work, but also from sharing the means to do so with others. In each article, the text covers just the basics and the demonstration does the rest. Most artists are visual learners, so step-by-step demonstrations allow these skilled instructors to show rather than tell you how to create or improve a drawing or painting. Artists such as Sherrie McGraw, Daniel Keys, Nancy Guzik, and Morgan Weistling share their techniques for painting figures, landscapes, still lifes, and portraits, and they even let us in on the colors on their palettes and the materials they can't do without, providing you with a lengthy list of tools you can experiment with in your studio.\n\nStill Life\n8 Make the Most of North Light &amp; a Prismatic Palette\n12 Mix Undiluted Paints Directly on Your Canvas\n14 Look Beyond the Objects\n20 Daniel J.
