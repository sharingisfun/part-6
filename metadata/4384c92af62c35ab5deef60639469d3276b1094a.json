His critically acclaimed exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© on the inner workings of the George W. Bush administration brought to light the candid assessments of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢NeillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a principal of the National Security Council and the only member of BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inner circle to leave and agree to speak frankly about his experiences. The One Percent Doctrine is an account of the U.S. response to terrorism and the response of terrorists.\n\nDrawing upon his privileged access to numerous government authorities, Suskind examines how agencies such as the NSA, CIA, and FBI have conducted the war on terror since the attacks of 9/11. Suskind chronicles the tension and disagreements between intelligence experts and White House policy makers. Ultimately, he describes an administration whose substantial failings threaten to undermine national security.\nAn engaging reading from George Guidall makes this highly provocative work an essential listen.\n - - -\n\n From The New Yorker:\n\nIn November, 2001, Suskind writes, Vice-President Dick Cheney announced that if there was &quot;a one percent chance&quot; that a threat was real &quot;we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response.&quot; He added, &quot;It's not about our analysis, or finding a preponderance of evidence.&quot; This view of a White House dangerously indifferent to facts is familiar from, among other sources, Suskind's &quot;The Price of Loyalty,&quot; but he adds much here that is disconcerting, particularly regarding the embrace of torture. (It's hard to shake the image of Bush asking, literally, for Ayman al-Zawahiri's head, which the C.I.A. briefly thought it had found in a riverbed in Afghanistan.) Suskind, whose main source seems to be the former C.I.A. director George Tenet (to whom he is very kind), has made news with revelations about Western Union's coÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶peration with the C.I.A. and about a plan to release cyanide gas in subways, although it's not clear that this threat was more real than other phantoms the White House chased. \n - - -\n\n From Wiki: &quot;The One Percent Doctrine&quot;\n\nIt assesses the ways in which American counter-terrorism agencies are working to combat terrorist groups. In the narrative, Suskind criticizes the Bush administration for formulating its terrorism policies based on political goals rather than geopolitical realities.\n\nThe title comes from a story within the book in which Vice President Dick Cheney describes the Bush administration's doctrine on dealing with terrorism:\n     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf there's a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response. It's not about our analysis ... It's about our response.&quot;\n\nOn July 24th, 2006, the book reached number 3 on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n - - -\n\nAwards: AudioFile Earphones Award\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4384c92af62c35ab5deef60639469d3276b1094a","amp;dn":"THE+ONE+PERCENT+DOCTRINE+-+Ron+Suskind+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4384c92af62c35ab5deef60639469d3276b1094a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,132,201,42,246,44,53,171,93,238,246,6,57,70,157,50,118,177,9,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
