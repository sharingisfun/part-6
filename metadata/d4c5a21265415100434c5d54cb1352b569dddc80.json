Evancho sings in the 'classical crossover' style of singers such as Hayley Westenra and Sarah Brightman. She studies singing with a voice coach, and also plays the violin and piano.\n\nOn November 1, 2009, Evancho released her debut album called Prelude to a Dream. The album features mainly covers of songs such as Andrea Bocelli's 'Con Te Partiro' and 'The Prayer', Josh Groban's 'To Where You Are', Martina McBride's 'Concrete Angel', and a cover of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; among others. Schubert's 'Ave Maria' heard on the album is not the original song, which is set to a secular text in German, instead, it's an arrangement of the Roman Catholic setting of the 'Hail Mary' prayer in Latin. The album debuted on The Billboard 200 at #121 on the chart dated August 28, 2010. It also debuted at #2 on Billboard Classical Albums Chart.\n\nOn August 10, 2010, on America's Got Talent, Evancho performed O Mio Babbino Caro by Giacomo Puccini. The aria is also on her debut album. She received a standing ovation after her performance, and was awarded a trip to Universal Studios in Florida for receiving the most fan votes from the submissions to the show from Y.o.u.t.u.b.e. She was then voted into the semifinals by viewers.\n\n\n1.When You Wish Upon A Star\n2.Nella Fantasia\n3.A Mother's Prayer (featuring Susan Boyle)\n4.Nessun Dorma\n5.Angel\n6.O Mio Babbino Caro\n7.Somewhere (featuring Barbra Streisand)\n8.All I Ask of You\n9.Ombra Mai Fu\n10.Lovers\n11.Imaginer (Broken Vow)\n12.The Lord's Prayer\n13.To Believe\n14.Dream With Me\n\nmp3 v0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4c5a21265415100434c5d54cb1352b569dddc80","amp;dn":"Jackie+Evancho+-+Dream+With+Me+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4c5a21265415100434c5d54cb1352b569dddc80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,197,162,18,101,65,81,0,67,76,93,84,203,19,82,181,105,221,220,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
