Lured by the notion of earning a month\\'s wages in only a week, Kudaj, Wolski, Nowak and Banaszak arrive in London, hoping to bring the wealth back to their Polish homeland. But in their absence, Poland is swept by political turmoil - the military have imposed martial law, outlawed the unions and put the free world on alert. Stranded in a land they do not belong to, the men struggle to return to the people they love, before it\\'s too late.\n\nJerzy Skolimowski\\'s \\&quot;Moonlighting\\&quot; is an outstanding achievement in many respects. Not only does it contain one of the most fulfilling performances that has ever been put to the screen, but it also serves as a political allegory, a smartly-told drama, and a unique exercise in creating suspense.\n\nQualidade de VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 1.230 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 128 kbps 48 KHz\nResoluÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o: 672 x 368\nAspect Ratio: 1.826\nFormato de Tela: Widescreen (16x9)\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\nTamanho: 914.3 MiB\nLegendas: Em anexo\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-04.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-06.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/moonlighting-06.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90cd70aba38a89beb0a0da1da619bda90b5c76ab","amp;dn":"Jerzy+Skolimowski+-+Moonlighting+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90cd70aba38a89beb0a0da1da619bda90b5c76ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,205,112,171,163,138,137,190,176,160,218,29,166,25,189,169,11,92,118,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
