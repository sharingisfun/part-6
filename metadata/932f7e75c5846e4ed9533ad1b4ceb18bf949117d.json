Adding layers of sometimes ethereal, sometimes majestic-sounding synth pads and drum loops to traditional instruments and electric guitars, the band became a signpost for other acts during the Celtic music boom at the end of the last century and the dawn of the new. After winning a Best New Age album Grammy in 1998 for Landmarks, the band took an extended break. They issued a live album in 2011, but NÃƒÂ¡dÃƒÂºr marks their formal return to studio recording after 15 years away. These 13 tracks -- ten originals, two traditional Gaelic tunes, and a Scottish air -- meld Irish music's heritage with contemporary jazz, electronic new age, and soft pop and rock. While many acoustic instruments adorn these songs -- mandolas, penny whistles, bodrahns, harps, and acoustic guitars -- so do electric six-strings, fretless basses, synths, and subtle loops adding edges and unsderscoring the band's mastery of textures to frame their melodies. While NÃƒÂ¡dÃƒÂºr breaches no new terrain, it will prove a welcome return for Clannad's international legion of fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932f7e75c5846e4ed9533ad1b4ceb18bf949117d","amp;dn":"Clannad+-+N%26aacute%3Bd%26uacute%3Br+%5B2013%5D%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932f7e75c5846e4ed9533ad1b4ceb18bf949117d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,47,126,117,197,132,110,78,217,83,58,209,180,206,177,139,249,73,17,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
