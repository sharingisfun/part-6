Ã¢â‚¬Å“It feels apt that the first track weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re releasing is Ã¢â‚¬ËœMotherfucker,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a song about accountability,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gould told Rolling Stone. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Basically weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created, recorded and mixed a new body of work by ourselves and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re releasing it on our own label. \nFaith No MoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LP is due out April via their own imprint, Reclamation Records.\nWhich means we should have it any day now,Hell we should have had it already!\n\nTracklist \n\n1.
