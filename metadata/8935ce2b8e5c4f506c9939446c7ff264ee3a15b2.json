Like each previous Myst title, Myst V: End of Ages advances the graphical beauty and detail of its worlds to create an environment that is so real you feel almost like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re living in it. Cyan carefully crafted and combined elements of adventure, puzzles, storyline, and gameplay innovation creating a worthy ending to the one game to which millions will forever compare any adventure title--Myst.\n\nMyst 5: End of Ages brings the marvelous story presented in the series to a very satisfying and definitive end. This is one of those games where you keep the whole end-credits rolling while you submerge yourself in thoughts of what you have just experienced and how incredible it was. It is even a little sad that this is it but every great story has to have an end and this is clearly the conclusion the series deserved.\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: EVERYONE, PEGI Rating: 7+\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectXÃ‚Â® 9.0c, 4.5GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\nCompatibility notice: This game is incompatible with Conexant audio devices.\n\n\n\nInstall and Play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8935ce2b8e5c4f506c9939446c7ff264ee3a15b2","amp;dn":"Myst+5+End+of+Ages+Limited+Edition+-+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8935ce2b8e5c4f506c9939446c7ff264ee3a15b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,53,206,43,142,92,79,80,108,153,57,68,108,127,242,100,238,58,21,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
