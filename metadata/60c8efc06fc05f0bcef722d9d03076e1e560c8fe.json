Each dreamer has his own vision which the playwright interweaves to form the substance of a waking vision.\n\nThe Caedmon CDs ripped as mp3s@192. A first-rate cast led by Paul Scofield. The performance scarcely shows its age.\n\nIf you prefer lossless audio download the folder Ã¢â‚¬Å“Current Poetry TorrentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and follow the instructions on the pdf.
