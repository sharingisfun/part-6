It categorizes the techniques into subtypes to simplify the broad spectrum of brain AVMs neurosurgeons may encounter. The book is organized into three sections: The Tenets, which establishes eight steps for AVM resection; The Seven Arteriovenous Malformations, which describes the anatomical terrain and surgical strategies for thirty-two AVM subtypes; and The Selection section, in which Dr. Lawton discusses what he believes to be the keys to successful AVM surgery: good patient selection and best application of multiple treatment modalities.\n\nKey Features:\n\nIncludes more than 700 spectacular full-color illustrations developed exclusively for this book\nCreates a system for conceptualizing and approaching AVMs\nIllustrates a stepwise process for AVM resection using strategic battle plans\n\nSummarizing the common AVMs encountered in practice, neurosurgeons and neurosurgical residents will find this hybrid atlas-text to be an essential part of their armamentarium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370c9094762a633e68e4cfa607541a8e3440666d","amp;dn":"Seven+AVMs+Tenets+and+Techniques+for+Resection+%5BPDF%5D%5Btahir99%5D+VR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370c9094762a633e68e4cfa607541a8e3440666d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,12,144,148,118,42,99,62,104,228,207,166,7,84,26,142,52,64,102,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
