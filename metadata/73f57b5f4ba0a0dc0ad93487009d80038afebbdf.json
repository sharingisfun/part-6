Allows you to find the passwords to documents using the computational power of computers in a network. The program consists of three components: server, agent and console. The server is installed on a computer on the network and manages the process of brute force. At any computers on the network can be an agent, which moves a portion of passwords issued to the server. Since any computer can run the console, which allows control over the server, add new tasks, and view statistics.\n\nThe program allows you to:\n- Find passwords for documents using the computational power of computers in a network\n- Work in local and global computer networks\n- To remotely administer the server brute force\n- Install and uninstall agents on computers\n- Change the time of the agents and the priority\n- Launch agents and server as a service running\n- To collect and view statistics\n\nSupported document formats:\nWord 97-2003, Excel 97-2003, PowerPoint XP-2003 (password to open the document)\nWord 97-2003, Excel 97-2003: guaranteed decryption of documents with the application of 40-bit encryption key (encryption by default)\nThe Secret Keys PGP (*.
