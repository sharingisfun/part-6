We'll take an introductory look into modeling so you can learn essential terms and definitions and build a solid foundation in computer graphics. We will start off by covering the basics of 3d models. We will then take a look at a variety of ways to work with models in Maya. After that, you'll learn about some of the Maya tools that can be used to construct models. And to wrap up, we will look at how geometry can be assembled into more complex models. This step-by-step Maya tutorial was developed with artists new to Maya in mind so we will be moving at a steady, easy-to-follow pace making sure you understand terms and basic techniques.\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6762d5ffb250af7edcfc4e654f724797626a892f","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Modeling+in+Maya+2011+-+sum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6762d5ffb250af7edcfc4e654f724797626a892f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,98,213,255,178,80,175,126,220,252,78,101,79,114,71,151,98,106,137,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
