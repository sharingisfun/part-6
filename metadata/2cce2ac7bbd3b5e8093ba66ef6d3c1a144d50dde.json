This subject, apart from being of prime interest to chemical engineers, is also increasingly gaining popularity and application in the fields of agriculture, biology, biotechnology, nanotechnology and micro-electronics. This introductory text discusses the essential concepts of three fundamental transport processesÃ¢â‚¬â€momentum transfer, heat transfer and mass transfer. All the three transport processes are explained using two approachesÃ¢â‚¬â€first by flux expressions and second by shell balances. These problems are applied to formulate the physical problems of momentum, heat and mass transfer. This book is designed for the undergraduate students of chemical engineering and covers the syllabi on Transport Phenomena as currently prescribed in most institutes and universities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cce2ac7bbd3b5e8093ba66ef6d3c1a144d50dde","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Transport+Phenomena+-+Momentum%2C+Heat+and+Mass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cce2ac7bbd3b5e8093ba66ef6d3c1a144d50dde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,206,42,199,187,211,181,232,9,59,166,110,246,211,193,161,68,213,13,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
