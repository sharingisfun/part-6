Rising to fame in the mid-'60s, Simon's songs were mature and literate, but also melodically engaging, and spoke to the concerns and uncertainties of a generation. As the 1960s gave way to the '70s and '80s, Simon's work tended to focus on the personal rather than the larger world, but he also expanded his musical palette, and helped introduce many rock and pop fans to world music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218d7343537b39a54bc197424d4c975b341f3870","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218d7343537b39a54bc197424d4c975b341f3870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,141,115,67,83,123,57,165,75,193,151,66,77,76,151,91,52,31,56,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
