When she was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy hailed her as an artist &quot;who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed.&quot;\n\nMÃƒÂ¼ller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of Communist Romania under the repressive Nicolae CeauÃˆâ„¢escu regime which she has experienced herself.  Many of her works are told from the viewpoint of the German minority in Romania and are also a depiction of the modern history of the Germans in the Banat, and Transylvania.  Her much acclaimed 2009 novel THE HUNGER ANGEL [Atemschaukel] portrays the deportation of Romania's German minority to gulags during the Soviet occupation of Romania for use as German forced labor.\n\n\nThe following three novels are in EPUB &amp; MOBI format:\n\n* THE APPOINTMENT (Metropolitan, 2001).  Translated by Michael Hulse and Philip Boehm.\n\n* THE HUNGER ANGEL (Metropolitan, 2012).  Translated by Philip Boehm.\n\n* THE PASSPORT (Serpent's Tail, 1989).  Translated by Martin Chalmers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1087189fc28a08ddadf9ec8f00779410f1c1b76d","amp;dn":"Herta+Muller+-+3+novels+%28Nobel+Prize+for+Literature%2C+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1087189fc28a08ddadf9ec8f00779410f1c1b76d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,135,24,159,194,138,8,221,173,249,236,143,0,119,148,16,241,193,183,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
