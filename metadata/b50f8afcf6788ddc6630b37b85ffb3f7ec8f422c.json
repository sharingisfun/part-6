But the showâ€™s subversiveness was spelled out by creator Joss Whedon in the opening scene, as a nervous blonde girl and a cocky, older-looking guy in a leather jacket break into Sunnydale High School late at night. The girl seems scared and keeps hearing noises. â€œWeâ€™re just going to get in trouble,â€ she tells him. â€œYou can count on it,â€ he replies, licking his lips. Finally, once sheâ€™s certain thereâ€™s no one else around, she reveals her distorted vampire features and sinks her teeth into his neck.\r\n\r\nIn its first two minutes, â€œWelcome to the Hellmouthâ€ establishes a universe, as the camera creeps slowly through a high school in the dark, lingering on skeletons in a classroom and shadows behind a door. But it also establishes a premiseâ€”that this is a show about female power. The pretty blonde, a vampire named Darla, isnâ€™t a victim but a predator, just as Buffy has strength and acuity that belie her looks. At the end of â€œThe Harvest,â€ the second part of the two-episode debut, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) watches Buffy and her friends walk away, cheerily discussing the ways in which she stands between the world and its total destruction. â€œThe earth is doomed,â€ he says, wearily. It's this kind of assumptionâ€”that being young and frivolous and having profound influence are mutually exclusiveâ€”that Whedon would go on to dispel throughout Buffyâ€™s seven seasons.\r\n\r\nBuffy is also unique in that, as much as Sunnydale is a Hellmouth, high school is hell. The monsters in the first season are literal manifestations of the demons that plague teenagersâ€”a controlling mother who's so intent on living through her daughter that she switches bodies with her, a pack of teenage boys who become uncontrollably feral, an Internet boyfriend who pretends to be a normal kid but whose real identity is much more complex (in this case, he's a demon called Moloch who got accidentally uploaded onto the Internet). In the episode â€œOut of Mind, Out of Sight,â€ one of Buffyâ€™s classmates is ignored to the extent that she physically becomes invisible. In transmogrifying common teenage issues into actual, tangible villains, Buffy makes them seem important, and worth agonizing over. It also makes them seem conquerable.\r\nThe monsters in the first season are literal manifestations of the demons that plague teenagers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTelevision has had lots of complex, admirable teenage heroines since Buffy, but it's hard to think of one so consistently empowered to take control of the circumstances around her, whether in the middle of a graveyard, surrounded by vampires, or in her bedroom, grounded. Buffyâ€™s super-strength is a physical attribute endowed by the forces of destiny, but it's also a state of confidence and competence that carries her through the varying traumas of having the fate of the world always on her shoulders. Joss Whedonâ€™s 2006 speech after being honored by the group Equality Now describes his frustration at consistently being asked why he writes strong female heroines. The real reason, he finally states, is because people are &quot;still asking me the question.â€ In a perfect world, Buffy at 18 wouldn't still seem so revolutionary, but if nothing else, it's another reason to appreciate it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50f8afcf6788ddc6630b37b85ffb3f7ec8f422c","amp;dn":"Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+-+Seasons+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50f8afcf6788ddc6630b37b85ffb3f7ec8f422c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,15,138,252,246,120,141,220,102,48,179,123,133,255,179,247,236,143,66,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
