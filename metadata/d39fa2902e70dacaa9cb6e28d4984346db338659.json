In fact, the Latin lilt lightened the beat and the flow remained muddy indeed. So the electricity generated by the percussion-heavy opening cut comes as a pleasant surprise, and the movement of what follows is a surprising pleasure. New second guitarist Neal Schon deserves special thanks for crowding out Gregg Rolie's organ. Maybe soon he'll come up with more than one idea per solo.&quot; B\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39fa2902e70dacaa9cb6e28d4984346db338659","amp;dn":"Santana+-+Santana+III+%281972+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A+%2Av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39fa2902e70dacaa9cb6e28d4984346db338659","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,159,162,144,46,112,218,202,169,203,110,40,212,152,67,70,219,51,134,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
