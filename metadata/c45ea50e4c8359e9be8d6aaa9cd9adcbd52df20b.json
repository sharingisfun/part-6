Graceling \nKatsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eightÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thug.\nWhen she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change. She never expects to become PoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend. She never expects to learn a new truth about her own GraceÃ¢â‚¬â€or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away . . . a secret that could destroy all seven kingdoms with words alone.\nWith elegant, evocative prose and a cast of unforgettable characters, debut author Kristin Cashore creates a mesmerizing world, a death-defying adventure, and a heart-racing romance that will consume you, hold you captive, and leave you wanting more.\n\n2. Fire \nShe is the last of her kind...\nIt is not a peaceful time in the Dells. In King City, the young King Nash is clinging to the throne, while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. War is coming. And the mountains and forest are filled with spies and thieves. This is where Fire lives, a girl whose beauty is impossibly irresistible and who can control the minds of everyone around her.\n\nExquisitely romantic, this companion to the highly praised Graceling has an entirely new cast of characters, save for one person who plays a pivotal role in both books. You don't need to have read Graceling to love Fire. But if you haven't, you'll be dying to read it next. \n\n3. Bitterblue \nEight years after Graceling, Bitterblue is now queen of Monsea. But the influence of her father, a violent psychopath with mind-altering abilities, lives on. Her advisors, who have run things since Leck died, believe in a forward-thinking plan: Pardon all who committed terrible acts under Leck's reign, and forget anything bad ever happened. But when Bitterblue begins sneaking outside the castle--disguised and alone--to walk the streets of her own city, she starts realizing that the kingdom has been under the thirty-five-year spell of a madman, and the only way to move forward is to revisit the past.\n\nTwo thieves, who only steal what has already been stolen, change her life forever. They hold a key to the truth of Leck's reign. And one of them, with an extreme skill called a Grace that he hasn't yet identified, holds a key to her heart. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!
