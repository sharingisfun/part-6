One hundred and fifty color photos reveal the analyzerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beauty though full-page spreads, lush close-ups of its components, and archival photos of other Michelson-inspired analyzers. The book includes sample output from the machine and a reproduction of an 1898 journal article by Michelson, which first detailed the analyzer. The book is the official companion volume to the popular YouTube video series created by the authors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cb253c740893d5c217311c30958ba8c724132b","amp;dn":"torrent-analyzer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cb253c740893d5c217311c30958ba8c724132b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,203,37,60,116,8,147,213,194,23,49,28,48,149,139,168,199,36,19,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
