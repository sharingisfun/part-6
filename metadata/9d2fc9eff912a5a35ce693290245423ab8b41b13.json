Could it have something to do with the reason the trainer was banned in the first placeÃ¢â‚¬â€the administration of illegal drugs to his horses?\n\nThen many more horses test positive for prohibited stimulants, and someone starts making demands, threatening to completely destroy the integrity of the racing industry. In order to limit the damage to the sport, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critical that Jeff find the perpetrator . . . but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll soon learn heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up against someone who will stop at nothing to prevail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2fc9eff912a5a35ce693290245423ab8b41b13","amp;dn":"Dick+Francis%27+Damage+by+Felix+Francis+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2fc9eff912a5a35ce693290245423ab8b41b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,47,201,239,249,18,165,163,92,230,147,41,2,69,66,58,184,180,27,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
