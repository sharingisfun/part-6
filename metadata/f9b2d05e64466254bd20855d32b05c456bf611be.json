This course shows how to create highly realistic 3D architectural drawings (including interior/exterior elements) with the lights, materials, camera, and render options in Twilight. Author Brian Bradley explains the importance of reflectance in materials, and shows how to manage and save rendering presets, how to correct for perspective, tone, and exposure in the camera, and how to create a variety of material types. The final chapter covers rendering your complete arch-viz scene for a couple types of output, including animation and composites.\nTopics include:\nInstalling Twilight\nAdding the Physical Sun and Sky\nEmploying Point, Spot, and Projector light types\nUsing light emitting materials\nManaging the Quality Presets\nPositioning your scene view\nWorking with the camera's Focal Length setting\nCreating diffuse, reflective, and refractive surfaces\nRendering out an alpha mask\nSetting up a depth render","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9b2d05e64466254bd20855d32b05c456bf611be","amp;dn":"Lynda-+SketchUp+Rendering+Using+Twilight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9b2d05e64466254bd20855d32b05c456bf611be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,178,208,94,100,70,98,84,189,32,133,93,50,176,92,69,107,246,17,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
