Jamiroquai were initially\nthe most prominent component in the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement,\nalongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, the Brand New Heavies,\nGalliano, and Corduroy. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as\npop, rock and electronica. Jamiroquai have sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and\nwon a Grammy Award in 1997\n\nThe band name is a portmanteau of &quot;jam session&quot; and &quot;iroquai&quot;, based on the Iroquois, a\nNative American tribe. The original band was Jay Kay (vocals), Toby Smith (keyboard), Stuart\nZender (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums), Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo) and Alec Moran\n(pipeau). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and\nproduction of the first album. The lineup of the band has changed several times, and the\nlongest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter Jason\n&quot;Jay&quot; Kay and drummer Derrick McKenzie (1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation\nof Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer\nof the Brand New Heavies. Despite his self-professed attempts to treat Jamiroquai as a band,\nKay has always been at the forefront of how the group is marketed, and has therefore always\nhad the lion's share of media attention, to the point where he is viewed as almost a solo artist\n\n\n\n  01 - Canned Heat [Album Version]                [05:31]\n  02 - Planet Home                                [04:44]\n  03 - Black Capricorn Day                        [05:41]\n  04 - Soul Education                             [04:15]\n  05 - Falling                                    [03:45]\n  06 - Destitute Illusions                        [05:40]\n  07 - Supersonic                                 [05:15]\n  08 - Butterfly                                  [04:28]\n  09 - Where Do We Go From Here?
