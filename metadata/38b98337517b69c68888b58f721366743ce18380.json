Last week Israel almost exhausted its stockpile of ammunition, and the US government came to the rescue by shipping to her more ammunition so that the killing and destruction of the innocent civilians in Gaza could continue unabated. Of course it is the American Taxpayers who paid the cost of these weapons and ammunitions.\n\nSo far the casualty count among the Gazans stands at: more than 1700 dead, and more than 9000 wounded; this is equivalent to a rate of 420 casualty every day.\n\nWe have 35 titles here:\n\n-  Brenner - Zionism in the Age of Dictators (1983)\n\n-  Chomsky - Middle East Illusions (2003)\n\n-  Coconi - Apartheid Against the Palestinian People (2009)\n\n-  Cook - Disappearing Palestine; Israel's Experiments in Human Despair (2008)\n\n-  Garaudy - The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics (1996)\n\n-  Glenn - No Beauty in the Beast - Israel Without her Mascara (2005)\n\n-  Hamzeh - Refugees in Our Own Land; Chronicles form a Palestinian Refugee Camp in Bethlehem (2001)\n\n-  Helmick - Negotiating Outside the Law; Why Camp David Failed (2004)\n\n-  Horowitz - Reckless Rites; PURIM and the Legacy of Jewish Violence (2008)\n\n-  Judis - Genesis; Truman, American Jews, and the Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (2014)\n\n-  Karmi - Married to Another Man; Israel's Dilemma in Palestine (2007)\n\n-  Keshet - Checkpoint Watch; Testimonies from Occupied Palestine (2006)\n\n-  Kimmerling - The Invention and Decline of Israeliness; State, Society, and the Military (2001)\n\n-  Kimmerling - The Israeli State and Society; Boundaries &amp; Frontiers (1989)\n\n-  Kovel - Overcoming Zionism; Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel-Palestine (2007)\n\n-  Lentin (Ed.) - Thinking Palestine (2008)\n\n-  Masalha - Imperial Israel and the Palestinians; the Politics of Expansion (2000)\n\n-  Masalha (Ed.) - Catastrophe Remembered; Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees (2005)\n\n-  Morris - 1948; the First Arab-Israeli War (2008)\n\n-  Morris - The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (2004)\n\n-  Morris - The Tantura Massacre Affair (The Jerusalem Report, Feb., 2004)\n\n-  Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid; a Re-assessment of Israel's Practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territories ..
