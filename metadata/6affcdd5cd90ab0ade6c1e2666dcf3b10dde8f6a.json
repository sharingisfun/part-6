A product of Pennsylvania, the quartet debuted in 1996 with an independently released EP, Porcelain; the disc sold over 10,000 copies locally, with the single &quot;Shimmer&quot; becoming a major hometown radio favorite. Its success brought Fuel to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released the EP Hazleton the following year. The band's debut full-length, Sunburn, appeared in 1998. Again, &quot;Shimmer&quot; proved Fuel's calling card, almost making the national Top 40 and -- with &quot;Bittersweet,&quot; &quot;Jesus or a Gun,&quot; and the title track (featured on the Scream 3 soundtrack) also earning airplay -- helping Sunburn to platinum-record status. Fuel's second album, Something Like Human, followed two and a half years later. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide \n\n\nFuel- Something Like Human\n 1. Last Time   \n 2.
