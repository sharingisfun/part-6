You fly around inside your computer, collecting icons or destroying them, and once all icons are dealt with, you are allowed to leave Inner Space. Imagine doing that at 36 frames per second, even on your 486? That's Inner Space. \n\nIncludes:\nThis includes the full game and &quot;The Works!&quot; package which includes a ship builder and a sound and voice effects package.\n\n\n\nThis game totally rules my childhood. The guy is _still_ selling copies of this game, which was made at least 100 years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b65faec45ba204f95cc2a18643b7765f7101181","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D%5BGame%5D+Operation%3A+Inner+Space","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b65faec45ba204f95cc2a18643b7765f7101181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,101,250,236,69,186,32,79,149,204,42,24,100,59,119,101,247,16,17,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
