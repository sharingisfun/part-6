The album was co-produced and engineered by the band and longtime associate Martin Birch. It is the only Deep Purple studio record featuring Tommy Bolin, who replaced Ritchie Blackmore on guitar.\n\nWhen Blackmore left the band, many observers and critics[who?] assumed that Deep Purple would not continue. It was David Coverdale who asked Jon Lord to keep the band together, and Tommy Bolin was asked to take the guitar slot. A deluxe edition of the album was released in 2010.\n\n35th Anniversary Edition 2CD [320k MP3]\n\nDisc One (Original Album Remastered)\n\n    &quot;Comin' Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54\n    &quot;Lady Luck&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    &quot;Gettin' Tighter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Dealer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;I Need Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n    &quot;Drifter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05\n    &quot;Love Child&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:07\n    &quot;This Time Around&quot; / &quot;Owed to 'G'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:13\n    &quot;You Keep on Moving&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:22\n\nBonus Track\n\n    &quot;You Keep on Moving (Single Edit)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n\nDisc Two (2010 Kevin Shirley Remixes)\n\n    &quot;Comin' Home&quot; - 4:08\n    &quot;Lady Luck&quot; - 2:46\n    &quot;Gettin' Tighter&quot; - 4:23\n    &quot;Dealer&quot; - 3:55\n    &quot;I Need Love&quot; - 5:16\n    &quot;You Keep on Moving&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:18\n    &quot;Love Child&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n    &quot;This Time Around&quot; - 3:24\n    &quot;Owed to 'G'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n    &quot;Drifter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n\nBonus Tracks (previously unreleased)\n\n    &quot;Same in LA&quot; (Coverdale, Hughes, Paice, Lord) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:19\n    &quot;Bolin/Paice Jam&quot; (Bolin, Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:47\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e938ae19cd9d9874f417f7a8560ebab1a371007","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Come+Taste+The+Band+%5BDELUXE+EDITION%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e938ae19cd9d9874f417f7a8560ebab1a371007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,147,138,225,156,217,217,135,79,65,127,122,133,96,235,171,26,55,16,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
