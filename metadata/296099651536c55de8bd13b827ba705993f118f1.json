While trying \nto unravel the mystery, Pemberton disappears, sending McIlvaine, his \nemployer, the editor of an evening paper, in pursuit of the truth behind \nhis freelancer's fate. Layer by layer, McIlvaine reveals a modern metropolis \nsurging with primordial urges and sins, where the Tweed Ring operates \nthe city for its own profit and a conspicuously self-satisfied nouveau-riche \nignores the poverty and squalor that surrounds them.\n\nIn E. L. Doctorow's skilled hands, The Waterworks becomes, in the words \nof The New York Times, &quot;a dark moral tale . . . an eloquently troubling \nevocation of our past.&quot;\n\nÃ‚Â©2013 Random House Audio; Ã‚Â©2010 E.L.
