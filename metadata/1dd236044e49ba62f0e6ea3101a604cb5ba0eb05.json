The arena-size crowd cheers wildly, and claps and sings along when given half a chance, as though each song were an up-tempo rocker. When they do have a song of even medium speed, such as &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; or &quot;Solid Rock,&quot; they are in ecstasy. That Dire Straits' introspective music loses much of its detail in a live setting matters less than that it gains presence and a sense of anticipation. Alan Clark's keyboards help to fill out the sound and give Knopfler's spare melodies a certain majesty, but Dire Straits remains an overgrown bar band with a Bob Dylan fixation, and that's exactly how the crowd likes it. [The CD version of the album contains one extra track, &quot;Love Over Gold,&quot; which adds a needed change of pace to the otherwise slow-moving first disc.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd236044e49ba62f0e6ea3101a604cb5ba0eb05","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Alchemy%3A+Dire+Straits+Live+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd236044e49ba62f0e6ea3101a604cb5ba0eb05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,210,54,4,78,73,186,98,240,230,234,49,1,166,4,203,91,160,235,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
