But how do we identify the genes that make up our genome? How do we determine their function? And how do different genes form the regulatory networks that direct the processes of life?\n\nIntroduction to Genomics is a fascinating insight into what can be revealed from the study of genomes: how organisms differ or match; how different organisms evolved; how the genome is constructed and how it operates; and what our understanding of genome structure and function means in terms of our future health and wellbeing.\n\nThoroughly revised and brought up to date, the second edition features:\n\n* Coverage of the latest techniques and developments in the field\n\n* Rich pedagogy: End-of-chapter exercises, web-based problems (&quot;weblems&quot;), and lab assignments; &quot;Special Topic&quot; boxes; engaging case studies new &quot;Ethics&quot; boxes exploring the ethical issues surrounding the study of genomics; highlighted key terms; and an end-of-book glossary\n\n* A larger format provides greater clarity to the text and accompanying figures\n\n* Five new chapters, including one dedicated to metabolomics\n\n* An updated Companion Website (www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199564354) offering a range of resources, including figures from the book in electronic format, answers to end-of-chapter exercises, hints to end-of-chapter problems, a guided tour of web sites in genomics, and rotating figures\n\nThe field of genomics is enabling us to analyze life in more detail than ever before; and Introduction to Genomics tackles this conceptually challenging--and fascinating--subject in a clear, lucid way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d86e636fd87b3f6fe2c04e1f02667d1f0ec1ad7","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Genomics%2C+Second+Edition+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d86e636fd87b3f6fe2c04e1f02667d1f0ec1ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,134,230,54,253,135,179,246,254,44,4,225,240,38,103,209,240,236,26,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
