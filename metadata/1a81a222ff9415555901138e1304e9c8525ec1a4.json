This book introduces for the first time the concept of hyperbolic simplex as an important concept in n-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.\n\nFollowing the emergence of his gyroalgebra in 1988, the author crafted gyrolanguage, the algebraic language that sheds natural light on hyperbolic geometry and special relativity. Several authors have successfully employed the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gyroalgebra in their exploration for novel results. FranÃƒÂ§oise Chatelin noted in her book, and elsewhere, that the computation language of Einstein described in this book plays a universal computational role, which extends far beyond the domain of special relativity.\n\nThis book will encourage researchers to use the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel techniques to formulate their own results. The book provides new mathematical tools, such as hyperbolic simplexes, for the study of hyperbolic geometry in n dimensions. It also presents a new look at EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special relativity theory.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press (December 18, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482236672\nISBN-13: 978-1482236675","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a81a222ff9415555901138e1304e9c8525ec1a4","amp;dn":"Analytic+Hyperbolic+Geometry+in+N+Dimensions+An+Introduction%28pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a81a222ff9415555901138e1304e9c8525ec1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,129,162,34,255,148,21,85,89,1,19,142,19,4,233,200,82,94,193,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
