My friends and I are set and determined to find out who is killing off Fae and Witches alike.\n\nCouple of problems in the way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I hate the Fae and the Prince of the Dark Fae is bound and determined that I work for him. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rude, overbearing egotistical ass with a compulsive need to possess, dominate and control me. Oh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ did I mention that he is absolutely sex-on-a-stick gorgeous and he makes me feel things that I never ever wanted to feel for a Fae...every time he touches me or looks at me with those dangerous golden eyes he seems to pull me further in under his spell, despite my better judgment.\n\nMy friends and I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust anyone and nothing is as it seems on the surface Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not even me.\n\nE-Book : Taunting Destiny\nAuthor : Amelia Hutchins\nLanguage : English\n\nI thought things were bad and weird before Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hold on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting worse.\n\nAdam and I are both going through identity crises of epic proportions as we Transition from who we were, and discover who we were meant to be. More Fae are dying, and I feel as if time is running out for us to find all of those responsible and put an end to the killings.\n\nThe people I thought I could trust have betrayed me and the one person I should absolutely not trust; is taking me deeper and deeper into his world.\n\nRyderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets are dangerous and devastating.\n\nWith each touch and word, he pulls my heart closer to himself and at the same time he is trying to keep me at armÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s length. The dance he and I have begun, is getting more complicated as our worlds are being shaken from all sides, and the visions of the future are frightening, and nothing like I had ever pictured for myself or those I care for.\n\nThis time, destiny is taunting me.\n\nI had always thought that I controlled my destiny. Now, my rights are being taken from me by powerful people and leaving me with alternatives that range between bad and awful.\n\nThis time, the choices I have to make can decide the fate of both worlds.\n\nEverything is unraveling, and nothing will ever be the same again.\n\nE-Book : Escaping Destiny\nAuthor : Amelia Hutchins\nLanguage : English\nISBN-13 : 9780991190928\n\nI thought things couldn't get worse. I was wrong.\n\nI found out what I really wanted and was forced to give him up. Just as I found out who I really am, I was presented to the elusive Horde King as a gift.\n\nThis was the mystical being I was hidden from for more than twenty years.\n\nAlthough Ryder promised to save me, I couldn't let him get near this creature, so I willingly (sort of) signed myself over to be his new plaything.\n\nNow in the Horde Realm, nothing is going remotely like I thought it would.\n\nMy powers and emotions are on the fritz, and each day seems to bring surprises that I am not sure how to deal with.\n\nThe Horde King thinks he has me exactly where he wants me. He thinks he has taken all of my options away.\n\nI still have choices.\n\nEmbracing what destiny has planned for me, or escaping it.\n\nE-Book : Seducing Destiny\nAuthor : Amelia Hutchins\nLanguage : English\nISBN-13 : 9780991190980\n\nLess than six months ago my life was twisted and flipped on its side. Things have changed so much I barely recognize myself anymore.\n\nI am no longer an Enforcer.\n\nI am no longer a Witch.\n\nI no longer hate the Fae. (For the most part)\n\nAnd the sex-on-a-stick-gorgeous-Fae? He isn't really the Dark Prince.\n\nNo, he is the father of my children and with the babies on the way, the land dying and the Mages closing in; alliances will have to be formed if we are all to make it through the war that is coming to our front door.\n\nBetween warring Gods and Goddesses, how are any of us supposed to win?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b46831d5cbfdc28133f9a648d8de11e40a9417ea","amp;dn":"The+Fae+Chronicles+-+Amelia+Hutchins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b46831d5cbfdc28133f9a648d8de11e40a9417ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,104,49,213,203,253,194,129,51,249,166,72,216,222,17,228,10,148,23,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
