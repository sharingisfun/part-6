Eight of the band's albums were certified gold or higher, and Triumph was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including Group of the Year Award in 1979, 1985, 1986 and 1987.\n\nLike their fellow Canadians Rush and Saga, Triumph began building their reputation across North America as a live band, peaking in the early to mid 1980s. The band was formed by Toronto music veterans Gil Moore (drums, vocals), Mike Levine (bass, keyboards, producer), and Rik Emmett (singer, songwriter) in 1975. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock and Roll Machine 1977\n\n\nRock and Roll Machine was the second album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1977. The album was released on RCA Records in the US in 1978 and again on MCA Records(MCA-1455) in 1980. The album resulted in the band's first hit single, a cover version of Joe Walsh's &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. Depending on the country of issue, the album may also be named Rock &amp; Roll Machine or Rock 'N' Roll Machine. The MCA issue is noteworthy in that the album was re-mastered by Bob Ludwig at his Masterdisk location as opposed to the original RCA which was mastered by Jack Adelman at RCA.\n \n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Takes Time&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Bringing It on Home&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Little Texas Shaker&quot;\n4.\t&quot;New York City Streets, Pt. 1&quot;\n5.\t&quot;New York City Streets, Pt. 2&quot;\n6.\t&quot;City: War March/El Duende Aconizante/Minstrel's Lament&quot; [Medley]\n7.\t&quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a Game 1979\n\n\nJust a Game is the third studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1979. The album contains their first big hit, &quot;Lay it on the Line&quot; and the near Top 40 hit &quot;Hold On&quot;.\n\nThe vinyl LP version of the album featured a sleeve that folded open to reveal a board game (though later pressings just contained a regular vinyl sleeve without this.) According to a Rockline interview, the board game was Rik's idea, but Mike was the one who actually designed it and decided to make it impossible to win.\n\nThe front cover of the album revealed a futuristic world where every symbol depicts a song featured on the album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Moving On&quot; (Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n2.\t&quot;Lay it on the Line&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n3.\t&quot;Young Enough to Cry&quot; (Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n4.\t&quot;American Girls&quot; (Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n5.\t&quot;Just a Game&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:13\n6.\t&quot;Fantasy Serenade&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:39\n7.\t&quot;Hold On&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n8.\t&quot;Suitcase Blues&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgressions of Power 1980\n\n\nProgressions of Power is the fourth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1980. The album reached #32 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart and the single &quot;I Can Survive&quot; hit #91 on the Pop Singles chart of 1980. The album was re-released in 1985 on MCA Records. Then re-released again by TRC Records in 1995 and remastered again in 2005 and re-issued on the band's own label TML Entertainment (formerly known as TRC Records)\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Live for the Weekend&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n2.\t&quot;I Can Survive&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n3.\t&quot;In the Night&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16\n4.\t&quot;Nature's Child&quot; (Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n5.\t&quot;Woman in Love&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n6.\t&quot;Take My Heart&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n7.\t&quot;Tear the Roof Off&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n8.\t&quot;Finger Talking&quot; (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n9.\t&quot;Hard Road&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllied Forces 1981\n\n\nAllied Forces is the fifth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1981. The album reached #23 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart assisted by the singles &quot;Magic Power&quot; and &quot;Fight the Good Fight,&quot; which hit #8 and #18, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock chart of 1981.[citation needed] A remastered CD was first released in 1985 on MCA, then again in 1995 on the band's TRC label, and for a third time in 2004 on the band's label TML Entertainment (formerly TRC Records).\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fool for Your Love&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n2.\t&quot;Magic Power&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n3.\t&quot;Air Raid&quot; (Levine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:18\n4.\t&quot;Allied Forces&quot; (Moore, Levine, Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n5.\t&quot;Hot Time (In This City Tonight)&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n6.\t&quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16\n7.\t&quot;Ordinary Man&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:17\n8.\t&quot;Petite Etude&quot; instrumental (Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:15\n9.\t&quot;Say Goodbye&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever Surrender 1983\n\n\nNever Surrender is the sixth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1983. The album reached #26 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart assisted by the singles &quot;All the Way&quot;, &quot;A World of Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Never Surrender&quot; which hit #2, #3 and #23, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock chart of 1983. A remastered CD was first released in 1985 on MCA Records (then again in 1995 on the band's own TRC label). A new remaster was released in November 2004 on the band's own label TML Entertainment.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Too Much Thinking&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n2.\t&quot;A World of Fantasy&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore, Patrick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n3.\t&quot;A Minor Prelude&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ :44\n4.\t&quot;All the Way&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n5.\t&quot;Battle Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n6.\t&quot;Overture (Procession)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n7.\t&quot;Never Surrender&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:41\n8.\t&quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n9.\t&quot;Writing on the Wall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n10.\t&quot;Epilogue (Resolution)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThunder Seven  1984\n\n\nThunder Seven is a concept album by the Canadian Heavy Metal band Triumph, released in November 1984. It was the band's seventh studio album. The album examines the actions and abnormalities of man at the turn of the 21st century.\n\nThe album was certified gold in the US by the RIAA, with sales of over 500,000 copies, on April 21, 2003, almost nineteen years after its initial release.\n&quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; was the band's highest charting single of the time, reaching #88 in both the UK and the US. Though another single was released under the form of &quot;Spellbound&quot;, the single didn't prove as successful, only charting in Canada, and barely scraping the top 100.[1]\n\nThunder Seven was the last Triumph album to not feature any outside writers; prior to this, no album featured non-band songwriters since Rock and Roll Machine (1977).\n\nThe album cover was illustrated by artist Dean Motter and was a mechanized version of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo Da Vinci. The cover is a visible element of the album's concept, in which the band examines the actions and abnormalities of man at the turn of the 21st century.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Spellbound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n2.\t&quot;Rock Out, Roll On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n3.\t&quot;Cool Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n4.\t&quot;Follow Your Heart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n5.\t&quot;Time Goes By&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n6.\t&quot;Midsummer's Daydream&quot; (Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:41\n7.\t&quot;Time Canon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:31\n8.\t&quot;Killing Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n9.\t&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n10.\t&quot;Little Boy Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStages 1985\n\n\nStages is a live album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1985. The tracks were recorded from various performances over the prior three years 1981ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1984 although two new studio tracks were added: &quot;Mind Games&quot; and &quot;Empty Inside&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot; (Gil Moore, Michael Levine, Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00\n2.\t&quot;Never Surrender&quot; (Rik Emmett, Michael Levine, Gil Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:43\n3.\t&quot;Hold On&quot; (Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n4.\t&quot;Magic Power&quot; (Rik Emmett, Michael Levine, Gil Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:12\n5.\t&quot;Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot; (Gil Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:20\n6.\t&quot;Lay it on the Line&quot; (Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n7.\t&quot;A World of Fantasy&quot; (Rik Emmett, Michael Levine, Gil Moore, Tam Patrick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n8.\t&quot;Midsummer's Daydream&quot; (Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n9.\t&quot;Spellbound&quot; (Gil Moore, Michael Levine, Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; (Gil Moore, Michael Levine, Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n11.\t&quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; (Rik Emmett, Michael Levine, Gil Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:36\n12.\t&quot;Mind Games&quot; (Gil Moore, Michael Levine, Rik Emmett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n13.\t&quot;Empty Inside&quot; (Rik Emmett, Michael Levine, Gil Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sport of Kings 1986\n\n\nThe Sport of Kings is the eighth album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1986. It was recorded at the band's home studio of Metalworks Studios from May to August 1986.\n\nThis is the second-to-last studio album to feature the band's guitarist and primary songwriter Rik Emmett, and it clearly represents the difficulties the band was experiencing at the time. Mike Levine played no keyboards on the album; three outside keyboardists were hired to create the keyboard sounds of the album. Rik Emmett sings lead vocals on six of the album's ten songs with vocals; four songs were sung by Gil Moore, and one track was sung as a duet by the two vocalists. The recording of The Sport Of Kings was marred by tension between Triumph and their label MCA. Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett has since expressed his dislike for much of the album. Adding to the tension was Emmett's request that the recording be done at Estudio L2K in Majorca. Only three of album's songs has ever been performed live by Triumph, and one track was performed live by Emmett during his first three solo tours.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Tears in the Rain&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n2.\t&quot;Somebody's Out There&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n3.\t&quot;What Rules My Heart&quot; (Emmett, Huff, Levine, Maloney) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \n4.\t&quot;If Only&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 \n5.\t&quot;Hooked On You&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 \n6.\t&quot;Take A Stand&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore, Santers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n7.\t&quot;Just One Night&quot; (Fanucchi, Martin, Schon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n8.\t&quot;Embrujo&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:29 \n9.\t&quot;Play with the Fire&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18 \n10.\t&quot;Don't Love Anybody Else But Me&quot; (Miller, Roynesdal) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n11.\t&quot;In the Middle of the Night&quot; (Emmett, Levine, Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance 1987\n\n\nSurveillance is the ninth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released July 27, 1987 (see 1987 in music).
