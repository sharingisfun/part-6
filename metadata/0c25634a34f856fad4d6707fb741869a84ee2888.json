Souther\nTenderness (2015)\n\nA 2013 inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, J.D. Souther is a legitimate legend in popular music.\nAn architect of the Southern California sound and a huge influence on modern songwriting, J.D. Souther has written or co-written many of the Eagles hits including &quot;Heartache Tonight,&quot; &quot;Victim of Love,&quot; &quot;New Kid in Town,&quot; &quot;Best of my Love,&quot; Don Henley's &quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; as well as the Eagles' 2007 hit, &quot;How Long.&quot; Linda Ronstadt has recorded many of his songs, including &quot;Faithless Love,&quot; &quot;Simple Man, Simple Dream,&quot; and &quot;Prisoner in Disguise.&quot; Souther s hit &quot;You're Only Lonely&quot; reached the top ten and was quickly followed by &quot;Her Town, Too&quot; which J.D. co-wrote with James Taylor. The Dixie Chicks' 1998 hit &quot;I'll Take Care of You,&quot; was written by J.D. and featured on their album Wide Open Spaces, which sold over 11 million records.\n\nAfter a twenty-five year performing hiatus, Souther returned to recording and live performance in 2008, blending his trademark Americana-influenced style with new flavors of jazz and blues. On his new album, Tenderness, J.D. s debut album on Masterworks, he worked with Grammy Award-winning producer Larry Klein who has produced albums for Joni Mitchell, Madeleine Peyroux, Herbie Hancock and Tracy Chapman, to name a few. Tenderness is a late-night masterpiece, haunting and wise and entirely reflective of the persona of this mysteriously brilliant American treasure. \n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Sony Masterworks\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Cue\n\n01.Come What May\n02.Something In The Dark\n03.This House\n04.Let's Take A Walk\n05.Dance Real Slow\n06.Show Me What You Mean\n07.Horses In Blue\n08.Need Somebody\n09.Downtown (Before The War)\n10.All Your Wishes (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c25634a34f856fad4d6707fb741869a84ee2888","amp;dn":"J.D.+Souther+-+Tenderness+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c25634a34f856fad4d6707fb741869a84ee2888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,37,99,74,52,248,86,250,212,214,112,127,183,65,134,154,132,238,40,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
