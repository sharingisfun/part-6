Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate metadata and pagination, etc.\n\n\nA literary mystery novel by the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\ndescription:\n\nGalip is a lawyer living in Istanbul. His wife, the detective novelÃ¢â‚¬â€œloving Ruya, has disappeared. Could she have left him for her ex-husband or Celal, a popular newspaper columnist? But Celal, too, seems to have vanished. As Galip investigates, he finds himself assuming the enviable Celal's identity, wearing his clothes, answering his phone calls, even writing his columns. Galip pursues every conceivable clue, but the nature of the mystery keeps changing, and when he receives a death threat, he begins to fear the worst.\n\nWith its cascade of beguiling stories about Istanbul, The Black Book is a brilliantly unconventional mystery, and a provocative meditation on identity. For Turkish literary readers it is the cherished cult novel in which Orhan Pamuk found his original voice, but it has largely been neglected by English-language readers. Now, in Maureen FreelyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful new translation, they, too, may encounter all its riches.\n\n-----\n\nMore books by Orhan Pamuk in nepalifiction's collection here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9907616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9907616&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d216082d81106b58c250b8f315762321f661fb8","amp;dn":"Orhan+Pamuk+-+The+Black+Book+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d216082d81106b58c250b8f315762321f661fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,33,96,130,216,17,6,181,140,37,11,143,49,87,98,50,31,102,31,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
