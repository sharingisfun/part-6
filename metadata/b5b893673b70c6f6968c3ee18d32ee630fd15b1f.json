ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album that aims to soothe rather than startle, replete with wistful, lovelorn lyrics and McLachlanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature arrangements -- a mix of new age atmospherics and singer/songwriter ambience -- courtesy of longtime record producer Pierre Marchand.&quot; [17]\nRolling Stone gave the album a negative review, stating that &quot;Sarah McLachlan's first disc since splitting from her husband, Ashwin Sood, feels scattered: The carefree single 'Loving You Is Easy' feels out of place. The rest alternates between vulnerability and bitterness, using the same sighs and moans with which she used to convey ecstasy.&quot; [18]\nSputnikMusic gave the album 4 stars and praised McLachlan's musical return to the style she explored in her earlier albums, such as Surfacing, Touch and Solace.[19]\nSlant gave the album rather negative review noting that &quot;Laws of Illusion sounds both effortless and effort-less.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Awakenings&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Illusions of Bliss&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Loving You Is Easy&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Changes&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Forgiveness&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Rivers of Love&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Love Come&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Out of Tune&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Heartbreak&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Don't Give Up on Us&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;U Want Me 2&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Bring on the Wonder&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Love Come&quot; (Piano Version)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b893673b70c6f6968c3ee18d32ee630fd15b1f","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Laws+of+Illusion+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b893673b70c6f6968c3ee18d32ee630fd15b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,184,147,103,59,112,198,246,150,140,62,225,141,50,238,99,15,209,91,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
