Or between neutrality and commitment? Gustav Perle grows up in a small town in â€˜neutralâ€™ Switzerland, where the horrors of the Second World War seem a distant echo. But Gustavâ€™s father has mysteriously died, and his adored mother Emilie is strangely cold and indifferent to him. Gustavâ€™s childhood is spent in lonely isolation, his only toy a tin train with painted passengers staring blankly from the carriage windows.\r\nAs time goes on, an intense friendship with a boy of his own age, Anton Zwiebel, begins to define Gustavâ€™s life. Jewish and mercurial, a talented pianist tortured by nerves when he has to play in public, Anton fails to understand how deeply and irrevocably his life and Gustavâ€™s are entwined.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6354d457fc6af5f942ac10151efa68048d6f0e95","amp;dn":"The+Gustav+Sonata+-+Rose+Tremain+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6354d457fc6af5f942ac10151efa68048d6f0e95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,84,212,87,252,106,245,249,66,172,16,21,30,250,104,4,141,111,14,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
