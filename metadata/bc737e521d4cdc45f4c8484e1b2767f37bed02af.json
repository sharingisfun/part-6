In 2004, the first demo was recorded and preparations for the first studio album were in full swing. All activities came to an abrupt stop when Juergen Zintz tragically committed suicide. In 2009, Tobias and Sebastian Ludwig (both Wraithcult, Ex-Helfahrt) und session drummer Seraph (Dark Fortress) completed the line-up and Thulcandra was able to finish their debut.\n\nIn 2010 ThulcandraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut unleashed a merciless winter storm upon the masses complete with freezing temperatures and endless darkness. The album was well received by fans and critics a like. One year later, the band continues to follow the musical path laid out on their debut with their second album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under a Frozen SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The debut was heavily influenced by Dissection, and Thulcandra stay true to their roots on the second album by honoring and revitalizing the trademark of the Swedish blackened death metal of the nineties.\n\nThis epic and cold masterpiece is a tapestry of harmonic leads, complex structures, infernal and driving drums and grim vocals. Mastermind Steffen Kummerer continues his musical journey through time by taking Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under a Frozen SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ back to the Sweden of the early 90s. The entire band is deeply rooted in the infamous sound of SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blackened death metal, which combines scorching riffs, anthem-inspiring melodies, delicate solos supported by driving drums, and intense vocal renditions. Thulcandra is able to find the perfect balance between ice-cold heaviness and a soothing melodic appeal. The tracks reveal the hidden details without losing a beat.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Under a Frozen SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ upholds tradition by once again relying on the production expertise of V. Santura (Woodshed Studios) and artistic mastery of the legendary Kristian Ã¢â‚¬Å“NecrolordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ WÃƒÂ¥hlin. Thulcandra also includes a cover of UnanimatedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life DemiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to pay homage to a style brought back to life with blazing intensity. Dissection, Unanimated, and Necrophobic will be relieved to know that their darkly legacy continues to impress at the hands of Thulcandra.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nGenre: Death\nSubgenre: Melodic Black / Death Metal\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 140.84 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n15 files\nAdded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc737e521d4cdc45f4c8484e1b2767f37bed02af","amp;dn":"Thulcandra+-+Ascension+Lost+%28Limited+Edition%29+%282015%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc737e521d4cdc45f4c8484e1b2767f37bed02af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,115,126,82,29,76,220,69,244,200,72,78,27,39,103,243,123,237,2,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
