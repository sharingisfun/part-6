Only this time, the computer is your mind, and the problems are the stresses and challenges of a manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life.\n\nThe Equation is That SELF-ESTEEM = WELL-BEING + CONFIDENCE\n\nIn the MindOS material you are about to encounter, you are going to learn just how to use that equation to literally create the kind of energy your mind (and life) runs on: self-esteem. It is that simple phrase we all use every day but never had a system for understanding.\n\nSelf-esteem.\n\nAnd the Anger and Anxiety Maps inside the MindOS DVDs show you precisely how to build it any time you want. It is the same as having a detailed blueprint for building your own inner psychology with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnuclear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ- level power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6286b174da18b2e2c73c25ef93cf2181dddc8af2","amp;dn":"David+DeAngelo+%26+Dr+Paul+Dobransky+--+MindOS+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6286b174da18b2e2c73c25ef93cf2181dddc8af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,134,177,116,218,24,178,226,199,60,37,239,147,207,33,129,221,220,138,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
