One friend is missing, one is in a mental ward--and one knows that Eve is responsible.\n\n Years later, Eve returns to Coffin Hill, only to discover the darkness that she unleashed ten years ago in the woods was never contained. It continues to seep through the town, cursing the soul of this sleepy Massachusetts hollow, spilling secrets and enacting its revenge. \n\n Set against the haunted backdrop of New England, COFFIN HILL explores what people will do for power and retribution. Noted novelist Caitlin Kittredge, author of the Black London series, brings a smart, mesmerizing style to comics. Artist Inaki Miranda (FABLES) brings his dynamic storytelling to COFFIN HILL, following an acclaimed run on FAIREST.\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to TaruTariat for this release.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1a90e0d28631afd9dd7c32069127ec8f489b2d","amp;dn":"Coffin+Hill+01-07+%282013-14%29+%28c2c%29+%28TaruTariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1a90e0d28631afd9dd7c32069127ec8f489b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,26,144,224,210,134,49,175,217,221,124,50,6,145,39,236,143,72,155,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
