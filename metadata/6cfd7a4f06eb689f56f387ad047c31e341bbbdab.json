He is best known by the stage name Chipmunk, which started as a nickname given to him by an older boy on the estate where he grew up, referring to the unusual shape of his teeth. He chose to use the name Chipmunk after the older boy was killed as a way of rememberance. While co-presenting Switch on BBC Radio 1, Chipmunk stated that he would eventually change his stage name, possibly to Mr. Munk (an alias which he already uses). He won the Best UK Newcomer at the MOBO Awards 2008. He also won Best Hip-Hop Act at the MOBO Awards 2009, overcoming US mega-stars such as Jay-Z, Kanye West and Eminem\n\n1. &quot;Saviour&quot;\n2. &quot;Chip Diddy Chip&quot;\n3. &quot;Oopsy Daisy&quot; (feat. featuring Dayo Olatunji &amp; Red Madrell)\n4. &quot;Man Dem&quot;\n5. &quot;Diamond Rings&quot; (feat.
