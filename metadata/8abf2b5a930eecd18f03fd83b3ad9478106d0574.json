Meet a determined group of theoretical scientists and fine artists who have abandoned careers and scoffed at graduate degrees to forge new lives as modern-day paper folders. Together they reinterpret the world in paper, creating a wild mix of sensibilities towards art, science, creativity and meaning.\n\nOrigami may seem an unlikely medium for understanding and explaining the world. But around the globe, several fine artists and theoretical scientists are abandoning more conventional career paths to forge lives as modern-day paper folders. Through origami, these offbeat and provocative minds are reshaping ideas of creativity and revealing the relationship between art and science.\n\nBETWEEN THE FOLDS chronicles 10 of their stories. Featuring interviews with and insights into the practice of these intrepid paper folders, the film opens with three of the world's foremost origami artists: a former sculptor in France who folds caricatures in paper rivaling the figures of Daumier and Picasso; a hyper-realist who walked away from a successful physics career to challenge the physics of a folded square instead; and an artisanal papermaker who folds impressionistic creations from the very same medium he makes from scratch.\n\nThe film then moves to less conventional artists, exploring concepts of minimalism, deconstruction, process and empiricism. Abstract artists emerge with a greater emphasis on concept, chopping at the fundamental roots of realism, which have long dominated traditional origami. The film also features advanced mathematicians and a remarkable scientist who received a MacArthur Genius Award for his computational origami research.\n\nWhile debates ebb and flow on issues of folding technique, symbolism and purpose, this unique film shows how closely art and science are intertwined. The medium of paper foldingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a simple blank, uncut squareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½emerges as a resounding metaphor for the creative potential for transformation in all of us.\n\nFormat : AVI\nLength : 465 MiB for 55mn 54s 792ms\n\nCodec : XviD\nSource : PDTV\nLanguage : English US\nSubtitles : None\nGenre : Documentary\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 016 Kbps\nAspect : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abf2b5a930eecd18f03fd83b3ad9478106d0574","amp;dn":"PBS+Independent+Lens-Between+The+Folds.Dec+22%2C2009.WS-PDTV.XviD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abf2b5a930eecd18f03fd83b3ad9478106d0574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,191,43,90,147,14,236,209,143,3,253,131,179,173,148,120,16,109,5,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
