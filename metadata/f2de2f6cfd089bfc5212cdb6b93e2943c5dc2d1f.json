All of Gogol's most memorable creations are here: the minor official who misplaces his nose, the downtrodden clerk whose life is changed by the acquisition of a splendid new overcoat, the wily madman who becomes convinced that a dog can tell him everything he needs to know. The wholly unique blend of the mundane and the supernatural that Gogol crafted established his reputation as one of the most daring and inventive writers of his time.\n\nUKRAINIAN TALES\nSt. John's Eve\nThe Night Before Christmas\nThe Terrible Vengeance\nIvan Fyodorovich Shponka and His Aunt\nOld World Landowners\nViy\nThe Story of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\n \nPETERSBURG TALES\nNevsky Prospect\nThe Diary of a Madman\nThe Nose\nThe Carriage\nThe Portrait\nThe Overcoat\n\nFrom the acclaimed translators of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, and The Brothers Karamazov, a brilliant translation of Nikolai Gogol's short fiction.\n\n......................................\n\n\nNow,\nbring me that horizon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2de2f6cfd089bfc5212cdb6b93e2943c5dc2d1f","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Tales+of+Nikolai+Gogol+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2de2f6cfd089bfc5212cdb6b93e2943c5dc2d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,222,47,108,253,8,155,252,82,18,205,182,185,62,41,67,197,220,45,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
