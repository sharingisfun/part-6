As a result, our country has generally worked to keep the military out of law enforcement. But according to investigative reporter Radley Balko, over the last several decades, Americaâ€™s cops have increasingly come to resemble ground troops. The consequences have been dire: the home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment has been gutted, and police today have been conditioned to see the citizens they serve as an otherâ€”an enemy.\r\n\r\nTodayâ€™s armored-up policemen are a far cry from the constables of early America. The unrest of the 1960s brought about the invention of the SWAT unitâ€”which in turn led to the debut of military tactics in the ranks of police officers. Nixonâ€™s War on Drugs, Reaganâ€™s War on Poverty, Clintonâ€™s COPS program, the postâ€“9/11 security state under Bush and Obama: by degrees, each of these innovations expanded and empowered police forces, always at the expense of civil liberties. And these are just four among a slew of reckless programs.\r\n\r\nIn Rise of the Warrior Cop, Balko shows how politiciansâ€™ ill-considered policies and relentless declarations of war against vague enemies like crime, drugs, and terror have blurred the distinction between cop and soldier. His fascinating, frightening narrative shows how over a generation, a creeping battlefield mentality has isolated and alienated American police officers and put them on a collision course with the values of a free society","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935b95c94304c8a10bfbd9b8d2837bcf84e71178","amp;dn":"Radley+Balko+-+Rise+of+the+Warrior+Cop+-+The+Militarization+of+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935b95c94304c8a10bfbd9b8d2837bcf84e71178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,91,149,201,67,4,200,161,11,251,217,184,210,131,123,207,132,231,17,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
