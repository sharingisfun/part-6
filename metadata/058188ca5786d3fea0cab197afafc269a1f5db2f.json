Though the power of genes is still emphasized in current biology courses and textbooks, a radically new understanding has emerged at the leading edge of cell science. It is now recognized that the environment, and more specifically, our perception (interpretation)of the environment, directly controls the activity of our genes. Environment controls gene activity through a process known as epigenetic control.\n\nThis new perspective of human biology does not view the body as just a mechanical device, but rather incorporates the role of a mind and spirit. This breakthrough in biology is fundamental in all healing for it recognizes that when we change our perception or beliefs we send totally different messages to our cells and reprogram their expression. The new-biology reveals why people can have spontaneous remissions or recover from injuries deemed to be permanent disabilities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058188ca5786d3fea0cab197afafc269a1f5db2f","amp;dn":"MIND+OVER+GENES+Workshop+by+Bruce+Lipton%2C+Ph.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058188ca5786d3fea0cab197afafc269a1f5db2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,129,136,202,87,134,211,254,160,202,177,151,175,175,194,105,161,245,219,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
