He prefers elegant, simple sites with clear language that serve a real need. He prefers that designers have strong spines.\n\nMike blogs frequently about the craft and business of design. In early 2011, he gave a Creative Mornings talk entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“FÃ¢â‚¬â€ You, Pay MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that uplifted the downtrodden the world over, and he can be heard weekly as the co-host of LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Make Mistakes with Katie Gillum. None of the terms Mike has coined are printable on a family website.\n\nYou can follow him on Twitter as @Mike_FTW, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not liable for what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 135 pages\nPublisher: A Book Apart (2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1937557049\nISBN-13: 978-1937557041","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178e8b98c71d70a6dd254aeac53077ec7160b596","amp;dn":"Design+Is+A+Job+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178e8b98c71d70a6dd254aeac53077ec7160b596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,142,139,152,199,29,112,166,221,37,74,234,197,48,119,236,113,96,181,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
