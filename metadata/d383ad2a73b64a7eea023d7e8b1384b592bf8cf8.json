Just up the road from the Village of the Damned and a hop, skip and a jump away from the Municipality of the Mildly Bloated. This is vintage horror stuff. A sleepy northeastern town, still under the shadow of the witchcraft trials it once held, a town thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now somehow completely forgotten by the world despite existing in the middle of New England in the 1960s. Get out your vintage horror bingo card and prepare to check off things like Ã¢â‚¬Å“elderly gas station attendant who warns people not to go up that road.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yes, all your favorite cliches are here!\n\nSpeaking of vintage horror cliches: Christopher Lee! Before he was Saruman, before he wasÃ¢â‚¬Â¦*sigh*Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Dooku, he was a professor of the occult with a penchant for sending pretty young female students off to dangerous, devil-worshipping towns. Might he turn out to be secretly evil? For your answer, we remind you again that this is Christopher Lee.\n\nJoin Mike, Kevin, and Bill for a road trip to the City of the Dead! Because hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still gotta be better than Fort Worth.\n\naka Horror Hotel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d383ad2a73b64a7eea023d7e8b1384b592bf8cf8","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+The+City+Of+The+Dead.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d383ad2a73b64a7eea023d7e8b1384b592bf8cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,131,173,42,115,182,74,126,234,2,61,126,139,19,132,181,146,191,140,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
