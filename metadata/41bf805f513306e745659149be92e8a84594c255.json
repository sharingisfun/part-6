The series was produced in two stages: Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1964 consists of the first six episodes covering the time period between the Brown v. Board decision and the Selma to Montgomery marches. It was broadcast in 1987 on PBS. The remaining 8 episodes make up Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1985, which was broadcast on PBS in 1990. The series was also shown in the United Kingdom on BBC2.\n\nCreated and executive-produced by Henry Hampton at Blackside, Inc., the series uses primary sources (such as archival footage and interviews with persons involved in the mentioned events) to record the growth of the civil rights movement in the United States, with special focus on the ordinary people who effected the change. It has been lauded for its depiction of the Civil Rights Movement, and used extensively in schools and other educational settings as a way to convey the experiences and struggle for civil rights in America.\n\nThe title of the series is derived from the song &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize&quot;, which is used in each episode as the opening theme music.\n\nThe film originated as two sequential projects. Part one, six hours long, was shown on PBS in early 1987 as Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years (1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1965). Eight more hours were broadcast in 1990 as Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1985).\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Awakenings (1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1956)\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fighting Back (1957Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1962)\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ain't Scared of Your Jails (1960Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1961)\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No Easy Walk (1961Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963)\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mississippi Is This America (1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1964)\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bridge to Freedom (1965)\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Time Has Come (1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966)\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Two Societies (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968)\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Power!
