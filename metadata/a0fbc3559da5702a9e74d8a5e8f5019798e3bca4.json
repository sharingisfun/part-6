Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father, is determined to find out. An allegory about the power of belief--and a page-turner that will touch your soul--Albom's masterful storytelling has never been so moving and unexpected.\n\nReaders of The Five People You Meet in Heaven will recognize the warmth and emotion so redolent of Albom's writing, and those who haven't yet enjoyed the power of his storytelling, will thrill at the discovery of one of the best-loved writers of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0fbc3559da5702a9e74d8a5e8f5019798e3bca4","amp;dn":"The+First+Phone+Call+From+Heaven+-+Mitch+Albom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0fbc3559da5702a9e74d8a5e8f5019798e3bca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,251,195,85,157,165,112,42,158,116,216,165,232,245,1,151,152,227,188,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
