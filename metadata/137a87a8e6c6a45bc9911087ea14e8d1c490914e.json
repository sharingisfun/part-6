So too is drama.' Christopher Wordsworth, The Observer\n'An admirable book which everyone interested in the history of the war should read' - The Glasgow Herald\nRichard Alexander Hough was a British author and historian specializing in maritime history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:137a87a8e6c6a45bc9911087ea14e8d1c490914e","amp;dn":"The+Great+War+at+Sea+1914+-+1918+by+Richard+Hough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"137a87a8e6c6a45bc9911087ea14e8d1c490914e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,122,135,168,230,198,164,91,201,145,16,135,234,20,232,209,196,144,145,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
