Keane\nHealth Harmony | 1999 | ISBN: 81-7021-913-2 | PDF | 351 pages | 10.4 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Juicing-Life-Guide-Benefits-Vegetable/dp/0895295121&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Juicing-Life-Guide-Benefits-Vegetable/dp/0895295121&lt;/a&gt;\nscanned to PDF by me.\n\nEating fresh fruits and vegetables can boost your energy level, supercharge your immune system, and maximize your body's healing power. Convenient and inexpensive, juicing allows you to obtain the most concentrated from of nutrition available from whole foods.\nThis A-Z guide shows you how to use nature's bounty in the prevention and treatment of our most common health disorders. This accessible book gives complete nutritional programs for over 75 health problems, telling you which fruits and vegetables have been shown effective in combatting specific illnesses and why. Along with hundreds of delicious, nutrition-rich juicing recipes, this book provides dietary guidelines, and diet plans to follow in conjunction with your juicing regimen. \nWhile Calbom and Keane promise no quick fix for various ailments, their simple-to-prepare natural &quot;potions&quot; fit the contemporary demand for instant--and healthful--gratification. Arranged alphabetically by ills (which range from acne to age spots to chronic fatigue syndrome, varicose veins and water retention), juice &quot;cures&quot; are touted here as &quot;vitamin and mineral cocktails&quot; that can detoxify the body and supplement the diet. Many of the same juice recipes work on sundry and specific ills; recipes for potassium broth, &quot;very veggie&quot; cocktail, &quot;Cherie's cleansing cocktail,&quot; &quot;ginger hopper,&quot; &quot;garlic express&quot; and &quot;chlorophyll cocktail&quot; are among the repeated panaceas. At the very least, juicing raw produce is a relatively direct means of introducing the vegetables recommended by nutritionists into daily habits. So while some will pigeonhole Juicing as just another New Age treatise, others--convinced of the place of the occasional juice fast in the diet--will find the volume fascinating, and well worth the investment in a juicer and organic produce. \n\nAbout the Authors &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/2f/f7/ee89c060ada09b16d61f2210.L._V192266298_SX200_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/2f/f7/ee89c060ada09b16d61f2210.L._V192266298_SX200_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nCherie Calbom, M.S., has been known for her work with juicing and health for more than a decade.
