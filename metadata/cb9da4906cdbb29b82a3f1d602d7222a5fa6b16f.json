I tried to keep the best \nvideo and audio quality with the smallest file size possible.\n\n*********************************************************************************\nI recommend using MLC Media Player as it plays every kind of file with no need to download any codecs, if you don't have MLC you might experience audio or video problems.\n*********************************************************************************\n\nI welcome any comments and sudgestions.\n\nMy torrent provides you downloads of up to 2MBPS, if your having trouble downloading any video due to slow speeds on anothe torrent, send me a request and I'll downloaded and put it on my torrent so everyone can enjoy the high speeds.\n\nEver since I started to use PirateBay, I've noticed the number of seeders vs. leechers and it's just down right pathetic. This is why I decided to register and start to upload from my personal collection. One person can make a difference, imagine if everyone left their computers running at night while you sleep.\n\n\nFor more of my awesome uploads and super fast download speeds visit: \n\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/%28PITBULL%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/%28PITBULL%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThank you and please seed so others can enjoy.\n\n\n((PITBULL))\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9da4906cdbb29b82a3f1d602d7222a5fa6b16f","amp;dn":"Thor+%282011%29+1080p+BrRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9da4906cdbb29b82a3f1d602d7222a5fa6b16f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,157,164,144,108,219,178,155,130,163,241,214,2,215,34,42,95,166,177,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
