Even though USB drives are very useful, they are potential breeding ground for viruses. When you stick your flash drive the host computer will look for commands in &quot;autorun.inf&quot; to be executed automatically. Normally those commands in &quot;autorun.inf&quot; are harmless, but if the file was modified, it may call for execution of a Trojan or whatever program in your USB flash drive automatically.\nNaevius USB Antivirus is a tool which protects your pen drive from autorun-viruses.\n\nKey features of Naevius USB Antivirus.\n- Protection against any Trojans, spyware, worms via USB storage.\n- Compatible with any antivirus resident like for example: BitDefender, Nod32, Kaspersky, AVG, Norton, McAfee, Panda, AVAST etc.\n- Protection in realtime with.\n- 100% protection from outside with write-protected dummy &quot;autorun.inf&quot; file.\n\n\nSEED AND SHARE !!\n\nCLICK ON MY USERNAME FOR MORE SOFTS !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b8a90d2519475d1bf37ea34c0f6716a40dffaf","amp;dn":"Naevius+Usb+Antivirus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b8a90d2519475d1bf37ea34c0f6716a40dffaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,184,169,13,37,25,71,93,27,243,126,163,76,15,103,22,164,13,255,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
