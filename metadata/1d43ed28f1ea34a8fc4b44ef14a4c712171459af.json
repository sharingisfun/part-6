Author George Johnson's mission is to list and describe the top 10 most &quot;beautiful&quot; experiments that have explored the mysteries of science. By &quot;beautiful,&quot; he means an experiment that has a straightforward elegance, where &quot;confusion and ambiguity are momentarily swept aside and something new about nature leaps into view.&quot;\nEach chapter covers one experiment or series of experiments. It explains the back story, the theory, the procedures the scientist used and any conclusion he or she drew. Included is a drawing or photograph of the scientist, quotes, diagrams and drawings.\nThe most unforgettable chapter for me concerned how Ivan Pavlov trained dogs to salivate to different stimuli. Pavlov loved his animals, and gave them names such as Buddy and Gypsy and Spot. He tried to spare his dogs pain, unlike many other animal researchers. The author describes an ornate fountain topped by a large dog that graces the grounds of Pavlov's institute still today, complete with busts of eight canines around the top, &quot;water pouring from their mouths as they salute in salivation.&quot;\n\nHere's the chapter list:\n1. Galileo: The way things really move\n2. William Harvey: Mysteries of the heart\n3. Isaac Newton: What a color is\n4. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier: The farmer's daughter\n5. Luigi Galvani: Animal electricity\n6. Michael Faraday: Something deeply hidden\n7. James Joule: How the world works\n8. A.A. Michelson: Lost in space\n9. Ivan Pavlov: Measuring the immeasurable\n10. Robert Millikan: In the borderland\nAfterword: The eleventh most beautiful experiment \n\nAbout the Author\nGeorge Johnson (born January 20, 1952) is an American journalist and science writer.
