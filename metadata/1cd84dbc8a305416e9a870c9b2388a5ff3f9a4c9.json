I am using utorrent, and I had the option checked to put a flag on incomplete files. But when the torrent started uploading, it was flagging my files as incomplete that were not. I have listened to them and they are fine. So it may be that some of what you have are complete files they just look like they&amp;#039;re not.\n\nAnyway, I removed that option, renamed all the times, and took out all the zune artwork hidden files that were getting in the way, and put back in the two albums I took out last time for the same problem and made a new torrent. So try the new one (maybe just picking the files that weren&amp;#039;t working before) and we&amp;#039;ll see how that goes.\n\nI know this is frustrating, I&amp;#039;m getting pretty frustrated too. Just keep me posted on what&amp;#039;s happening on your end and we&amp;#039;ll get this worked out.\n\nFor those of you just joining us, here is the list:\n\n\n1. Apples\n2. Reason to be Cheerful (2 disc)\n3. Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\n4. Do it Yourself (2 disc)\n5. Handsome (Kilburn &amp; the High Roads)\n6. Stiffs Live (w/ Costello, Lowe, etc.)\n7. Straight from the Desk\n8. Bus Driver&amp;#039;s Prayer\n9. Live in Lucianatten, 1980 (bootleg)\n10. Warts &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Audience\n11. New Boots and Panties (1 disc)\n12. Lord Upminster\n13.
