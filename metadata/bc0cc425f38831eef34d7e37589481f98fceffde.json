Brooks first greatest hits album, The Garth Brooks Collection, was released three months earlier exclusively at McDonald's restaurants for a limited time to raise money for the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities. The Hits was released on December 13, 1994 and was quickly deleted at Brooks' request[why?]. He insisted it only be available for a limited time, but not before it sold well over ten million copies. The Hits debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, and Top Country Albums. In June 1995, the master was buried under GarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Ain't Going Down (Til The Sun Comes Up)\n[02] Friends In Low Places\n[03] Callin' Baton Rouge\n[04] The River\n[05] Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\n[06] The Thunder Rolls\n[07] American Honky-Tonk Bar Association\n[08] If Tomorrow Never Comes\n[09] Unanswered Prayers\n[10] Standing Outside The Fire\n[11] Rodeo\n[12] What She's Doing Now\n[13] We Shall Be Free\n[14] Papa Loved Mama\n[15] Shameless\n[16] Two Of A Kind, Workin' On A Full House\n[17] That Summer\n[18] The Dance\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:06m:20s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 167mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
