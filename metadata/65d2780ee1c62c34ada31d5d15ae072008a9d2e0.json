That's exactly what this book shows youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how to deconstruct software in a way that reveals design and implementation details, sometimes even source code. Why? Because reversing reveals weak spots, so you can target your security efforts. Because you can reverse-engineer malicious code in order to neutralize it. Because understanding what makes a program work lets you build a better one. You'll learn how here.\n\n    * Learn to read compiler-generated assembly language code for IA-32 compatible processors\n    * Decipher an undocumented file format or network protocol\n    * Understand when reverse engineering is legal, and whenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and whyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it may not be\n    * See how hackers use reversing to defeat copy protection technology\n    * Find out how to pull the plug on malicious code\n    * Determine how to prevent others from reversing your code, and find out how effective such steps can be\n    * Explore reverse engineering on the .NET platform and its assembly language, MSIL\n    * Observe the dissection of a real-world malicious program and see how the attacker used it to control infected systems\n\nAbout the Author\nEldad Eilam is a consultant in the field of reverse engineering. He assists clients with operating system and in-depth software reverse engineering, and has devoted several years to developing advanced reverse engineering techniques.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 624 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (April 15, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0764574817\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0764574818","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d2780ee1c62c34ada31d5d15ae072008a9d2e0","amp;dn":"Reversing-Secrets+of+Reverse+Engineering+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d2780ee1c62c34ada31d5d15ae072008a9d2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,210,120,14,225,198,44,52,173,163,29,93,21,174,7,32,8,169,210,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
