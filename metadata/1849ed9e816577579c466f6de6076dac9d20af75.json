The procedure is now performed by only four doctors in the United States, all former colleagues of Dr. Tiller, who risk their lives every day in the name of their unwavering commitment toward their patients. Directors Martha Shane and Lana Wilson have created a moving and unique look at one of the most incendiary topics of our time, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done so in an informative, thought-provoking, and compassionate way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1849ed9e816577579c466f6de6076dac9d20af75","amp;dn":"After.Tiller.2013.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1849ed9e816577579c466f6de6076dac9d20af75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,73,237,158,129,101,119,87,156,70,111,109,230,7,109,172,157,32,175,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
