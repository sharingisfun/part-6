I actually downloaded the original Fleming novels here on the Pirate Bay, so I give this community credit for starting my love.\n\nBut here's the problem: I could only find the Fleming books and a few others on the web. They're still not widely available on the web, and that's a shame. So here's my gift to the Pirate Bay community. 46 James Bond novels, in both Epub and Mobi format. Here is a listing of the books in my collection and what I'm currently missing:\n\nIan Fleming:\n1.  Casino Royale\n2.  Live and Let Die\n3.  Moonraker\n4.  Diamonds are Forever\n5.  From Russia With Love\n6.  Doctor No\n7.  Goldfinger\n8.  For Your Eyes Only\n9.  Thunderball\n10. The Spy Who Loved Me\n11. On Her Majesty's Secret Service\n12. You Only Live Twice\n13. The Man with the Golden Gun\n14. Octopussy and the Living Daylights\n\nRobert Markham as Kingsley Amis\n1.  Colonel Sun\n\nChristopher Wood\n1.  The Spy Who Loved Me (Movie Novelization)\n2.  Moonraker (Movie Novelization)\n\n\nJohn Gardner\n1.  MISSING: License Renewed\n2.  For Special Services\n3.  Icebreaker\n4.  Role of Honour\n5.  Nobody Lives Forever\n6.  No Deals, Mr. Bond\n7.  Scorpius\n8.  MISSING: Win, Lose, or Die\n9.  Licence to Kill (Movie Novelization)\n10. Brokenclaw\n11. The Man from Barbarossa\n12. Death is Forever\n13. Never Send Flowers\n14. Seafire\n15. Goldeneye (Movie Novelization)\n16. Cold\n\nRaymond Benson\n1.  Blast From The Past\n2.  Zero Minus 10\n3.  Tomorrow Never Dies (Movie Novelization)\n4.  The Facts of Death\n5.  Midsummer Night's Doom\n6.  High Time to Kill\n7.  Live at Five\n8.  The World is Not Enough (Movie Novelization)\n9.  Doubleshot\n10. Never Dream of Dying\n11. The Man with the Red Tattoo\n12. Die Another Day (Movie Novelization)\n\nSebastian Faulks\n1. Devil May Care\n\nThe final two books, Carte Blanche and Solo, are missing from this collection. But they are recent novels and readily available online. Otherwise, I am missing two John Gardner books by my count. General quality of the books is high, with some minor aberrations here and there (nothing that affects readability).\n\nThis collection represents a lot of work. Please share it if you like it. And if you have a hard to find collection one day, I hope you share it with the community yourself one day. That's the greatest praise I could get for my efforts!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61fc27c96967ba04539ec1e1c5de38de4d6880c3","amp;dn":"James+Bond+Book+Collection+-+46+Books+-+Epub+and+Mobi+-+Various+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61fc27c96967ba04539ec1e1c5de38de4d6880c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,252,39,201,105,103,186,4,83,158,193,225,197,222,56,222,77,104,128,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
