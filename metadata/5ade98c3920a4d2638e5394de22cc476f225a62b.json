It's a powerful photo editing tool in its own right, capable of taking your photos from raw material to polished gems. In this course, Adobe evangelist Julieanne Kost takes you through all of Camera Raw's capabilities, from fixing common but vexing problems to finding more creative uses for the program's rich and nondestructive editing tools. Learn how to correct color, fix perspective problems, and enhance detail and contrast to make images come alive. Then find out how to make localized color corrections, custom black-and-white images, and even panoramas and HDR composites. If you're interested in becoming more efficient in Camera Raw, Julieanne also includes a chapter on using presets, synchronization, and batch processing to automate some of your corrections.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tComparing raw and JPEG files\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCorrecting lens distortion and perspective correction\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRemoving chromatic aberration\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCropping and straightening a tilted horizon \n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tFixing color cast with the White Balance tool\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRevealing shadow and highlight detail\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSharpening and reducing noise\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRemoving haze and adding clarity\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMaking localized adjustments\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tConverting to black and white\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tEmulating film grain\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding vignettes\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRetouching portraits: skin, eyes, and teeth\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAutomating corrections\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMerging images for panoramas or HDR images\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ade98c3920a4d2638e5394de22cc476f225a62b","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Adobe+Camera+Raw+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ade98c3920a4d2638e5394de22cc476f225a62b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,222,152,195,146,10,77,38,56,229,57,77,226,44,196,118,242,37,166,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
