The DVDs include the live interpretation of all the songs that were recorded during the sessions of the album, in the own Born In The U.S.A. Tour and through these thirty years.\n\nFor the entire project visit springsteencorner.com (in spanish).\n\nThanks to TheLonely for having the idea of this project and trust me to do this part. Thanks to him also for his translations, they have helped me very much to do the subtitles.
