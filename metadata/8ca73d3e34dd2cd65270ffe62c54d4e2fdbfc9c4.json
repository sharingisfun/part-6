Authoritative, superbly crafted and easy to use, Collins Complete Woodworker's Manual is the UK bestseller and the one book every woodworker needs. This revised edition has been extensively rewritten and contains new photographs and illustrations. It includes new products and techniques developed since the last edition. Every stage in crafting furniture and other decorative pieces are fully explained starting with the basics; the nature of wood, the tools required and setting up a workshop. The book then examines the principles of three-dimensional design from inspiration to construction. Step-by-step illustrations demonstrate how to make every type of joint and all the major crafts are given detailed coverage with the same step-by-step approach: bending wood, veneering and marquetry, woodcarving and finishing. The book also includes a chapter on using other materials, such as metal, glass and leather in combination with wood, plus a chapter on fixings and fittings.\nAlbert Jackson and David Day were both awarded Masters degrees in furniture design at the Royal College of Art. They have written numerous bestselling titles on woodworking and DIY, including the Collins Complete DIY Manual.\n\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE - WOOD THE RAW MATERIAL 9\nCHAPTER TWO - DESIGNING IN WOOD 69\nCHAPTER THREE - HANDTOOLS 105\nCHAPTER FOUR - POWER TOOLS 153\nCHAPTER FIVE - MACHINE TOOLS 187\nCHAPTER SIX - HOME WORKSHOPS 231\nCHAPTER SEVEN - JOINT-MAKING 237\nCHAPTER EIGHT - BENDING WOOD 271\nCHAPTER NINE - VENEERING AND MARQUETRY 279\nCHAPTER TEN - WOODCARVING 293\nCHAPTER ELEVEN - FINISHING WOOD 305\nCHAPTER TWELVE - FIXINGS AND FITTINGS 333\nGlossary 343\nIndex 347","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ca73d3e34dd2cd65270ffe62c54d4e2fdbfc9c4","amp;dn":"Collins+Complete+Woodworker%27s+Manual+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ca73d3e34dd2cd65270ffe62c54d4e2fdbfc9c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,167,61,62,52,221,44,214,82,112,255,230,44,84,212,226,253,191,201,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
