But they must also have boundaries. On one level this is what politics and business are all about. Too much of the wrong sort of control and the system becomes bureaucratic or tyrannical, too little and it becomes arbitrary and chaotic. This book covers these key issues surrounding leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0066c90e17969502b59a8d255f6d176fa2bcfeab","amp;dn":"The+Illusion+of+Leadership%3A+Directing+Creativity+in+Business+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0066c90e17969502b59a8d255f6d176fa2bcfeab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,102,201,14,23,150,149,2,181,154,141,37,95,109,23,111,162,188,254,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
