Despondent, Julie attempts suicide, but she cannot bring herself to take her own life. Instead, she sets about starting over, purging all remnants of her former existence in an attempt to sever her ties to the past. A piece in the trio of films loosely inspired by the colors of the French flag and their corresponding symbolic qualities, the basic focus of Blue is liberty.\n\nWhite:\n\nThe second feature in filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's &quot;Three Colors&quot; trilogy, the black comedy White features Zbigniew Zamachowski as Karol Karol, an expatriate Polish hairdresser whose French wife (the breathtaking Julie Delpy) divorces him after just six months of marriage because of his impotency. Penniless and devoid of his passport, Karol must journey back to Poland by hiding in a trunk. Upon his return, he slowly begins amassing a considerable fortune, ultimately hatching a perverse plot for revenge. Often unjustly dismissed as the weak link in the trilogy, White grows in strength upon repeated viewings. An allegory about equality, the film is mordantly witty, a cynical look at power, marriage and capitalism.\n\nRed:\n\nThe concluding chapter in filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's &quot;Three Colors&quot; trilogy, Red stars the luminous IrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Jacob as Valentine, a young student and fashion model who befriends a bitter former judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant, his character a proxy for Kieslowski himself). Their accidental meeting is just one of the many chance encounters woven through the narrative fabric of this feature, the most accomplished effort in Kieslowski's highly ambitious series. Like its predecessors, Red corresponds to a color of the French flag, as well as the color's symbolic attributes. The subject here is fraternity, and indeed, its central characters are all closely connected, their destinies locked on a collision course. The film's final scene even ties up the trilogy by bringing together the protagonists of the other features.\n\n\n\nLinks to trilogy:\n\n\nAs a whole (complete trilogy):\n\nAllmovie -----------&gt; http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=16:35108\nRottentomatoes ----------&gt; http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/three_colors_trilogy/\n\nIndividual films:\n\nBlue: Allmovie -------&gt; http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:131104\nWhite: Allmovie ------&gt; http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:131195\nRed: Allmovie --------&gt; http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:134234\n\nBlue: Rottentomatoes ---&gt; http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1049109-blue/\nWhite: Rottentomatoes ----&gt; http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white/\nRed: Rottentomatoes -----&gt; http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058966-red/\n\n\n\nAll three of these films have 100% untouched video bitrate, nothing was re-encoded. I had to strip all of the extras in order to keep an untouched bitrate. This torrent is 1/3 the size of the trilogy with all of the extras included, so you won't be affecting your ratio very much. I made this torrent for the people out there who don't want to screw up their ratios, and also for the people who are content with having an untouched video bitrate while not having any of the extras.\n\nBTW, DVD Rebuilder was used to blank out all the extras.\n\n\nthanks goes to unknown uploader @ tik","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd947424c1e20b1378fd7d54b9262c60a5dcf0f","amp;dn":"Krzysztof+Kieslowski+-+Three+Colors+NTSC+3xDVD5+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd947424c1e20b1378fd7d54b9262c60a5dcf0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,217,71,66,76,30,32,177,55,143,215,213,75,146,98,198,10,93,207,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
