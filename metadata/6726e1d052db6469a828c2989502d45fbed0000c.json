The tragic loss of life and stoic endurance by troops who walked towards their death is an iconic image which will be hard to ignore during the centennial year.\r\n\r\nDespite this, this book shows the extent to which the Allied armies were in fact able repeatedly to break through the German front lines. The author has uncovered some remarkable stories, as yet unknown, of action and heroism in the face of battle. He weaves in these firsthand experiences, creating a remarkable portrait of life at the front","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6726e1d052db6469a828c2989502d45fbed0000c","amp;dn":"Somme_+Into+the+Breach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6726e1d052db6469a828c2989502d45fbed0000c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,38,225,208,82,219,100,105,168,40,194,152,149,2,212,95,190,208,0,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
