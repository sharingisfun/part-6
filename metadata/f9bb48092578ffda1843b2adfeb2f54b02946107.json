This book will address many of the factors affecting current and emerging energy use choices, including the availability and desirability of various fuels - and in particular, hydrogen. Topics include energy policy, fuel supply trends, statistics and projections, oil reserves, alternative scenarios, energy utilization, sustainable energy, cost analysis, fuel escalation, energy and development, regulatory issues, barriers to implementation, conversion systems, storage systems, thermodynamic efficiency, fuel chain efficiency, life-cycle efficiency, technology issues, extracting, refining, air emission issues, safety, natural gas, hydrogen gas, methanol, ethanol, steam reforming, and fuel cells","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9bb48092578ffda1843b2adfeb2f54b02946107","amp;dn":"Alternative+Fuels+-+The+Future+of+Hydrogen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9bb48092578ffda1843b2adfeb2f54b02946107","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,187,72,9,37,120,255,218,24,67,178,173,254,178,245,75,2,148,97,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
