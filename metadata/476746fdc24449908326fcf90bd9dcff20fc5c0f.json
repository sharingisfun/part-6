Born in Gary, Indiana and raised in Encino, Los Angeles, California, she is the youngest child of the Jackson family of musicians. She first performed on stage with her family beginning at the age of seven, and later started her career as an actress with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976. She went on to star in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Diff'rent Strokes.\n\nAt age sixteen in 1982, she signed a recording contract with A&amp;M, releasing her self-titled debut album the same year. She faced criticism for her limited vocal range, and for being yet another member of the Jackson family to become a recording artist. Beginning with her third studio album Control (1986), she began a long-term collaboration with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Her music with Jam and Lewis incorporated contemporary R&amp;B with elements of rap music, sample loop, triplet swing and industrial beats, which led to crossover appeal in popular music. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her albums, choreography, music videos, and prominence on MTV, Jackson was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.\n\nIn 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar recording contracts with Virgin Records, which established her as one of the highest paid artists in the music industry. Her debut album under the Virgin label, janet. (1993), saw Jackson develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the decade, she was named the second most successful recording artist of the 1990s. All for You (2001), became her fifth consecutive studio album to hit number one on the Billboard 200 album charts. In 2007, she changed labels, signing with the Island Def Jam Music Group and released her tenth studio album Discipline the following year.\n\nJackson is ranked by Billboard magazine as one of the top ten best-selling music artists in the history of contemporary music, having sold over 100 million albums worldwide.[1] The Recording Industry Association of America lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums.[2] Her longevity in the recording industry has rivaled that of several entertainers and her musical style and choreography have influenced a number of contemporary pop and R&amp;B artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl 1986\n\n\nControl is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 6, 1986 by A&amp;M Records, and is widely regarded as the breakthrough album of her career. Her collaboration with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&amp;B. Control enabled Jackson to transition into the popular music market, becoming one of the defining albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.\n\nThe theme of Control is an autobiographical account of Jackson's resolve to take charge of her life and career. A majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life; a recent annulment from R&amp;B singer James DeBarge, permanently severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring A&amp;M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and a personal testament of self-actualization.\n\nIt became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 and five of its commercial singlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;When I Think of You&quot;, and &quot;Let's Wait Awhile&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to receive several accolades, including the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. Control is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time.[1] The album has been certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over ten million records worldwide.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Control&quot; (James Harris III, Terry Lewis, Janet Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:53\n2.\t&quot;Nasty&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n3.\t&quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n4.\t&quot;You Can Be Mine&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n5.\t&quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; (Monte Moir) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n6.\t&quot;When I Think of You&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n7.\t&quot;He Doesn't Know I'm Alive&quot; (Spencer Bernard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n8.\t&quot;Let's Wait Awhile&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson, Melanie Andrews) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n9.\t&quot;Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)&quot; (Harris, Lewis, Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhythm Nation 1814  1989\n\n\nJanet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. Released on September 12, 1989 by A&amp;M Records, Rhythm Nation 1814 is the second album of Jackson's career to be co-written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Jackson also shares production credits with long-term collaborator Jellybean Johnson and executive producer John McClain.\n\nDeparting from themes of independence present in Jackson's third studio album Control (1986), Rhythm Nation 1814 is a concept album based on social injustice. Though A&amp;M executives wanted an album similar to Control, Jackson insisted on addressing social issues. Jackson and her producers routinely watched television news reportsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½predominately from CNNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as a source of inspiration for the album's lyrics. Produced during the height of the new jack swing genre, the album incorporates contemporary R&amp;B with rap vocals, as well as the utilization of swung notes and industrial beats.\n\nRhythm Nation 1814 became Jackson's second consecutive album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart and emerged as the best-selling album of 1990 in the United States. Its seven commercial singles, &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;Black Cat&quot;, and &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; all peaked within the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, becoming the first and only album to achieve that feat. The album has been certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over fourteen million records worldwide. It has been named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and is also listed as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Interlude: Pledge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47\n2.\t&quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; (Janet Jackson, James Harris III, Terry Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31 \no\tSamples: &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; performed by Sly &amp; the Family Stone\n3.\t&quot;Interlude: T.V.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:22\n4.\t&quot;State of the World&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n5.\t&quot;Interlude: Race&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:05\n6.\t&quot;The Knowledge&quot; (Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n7.\t&quot;Interlude: Let's Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:03\n8.\t&quot;Miss You Much&quot; (Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n9.\t&quot;Interlude: Come Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:21\n10.\t&quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; (Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n11.\t&quot;Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)&quot; (Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n12.\t&quot;Alright&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26 \no\tSamples: &quot;Think (About It)&quot; performed by Lyn Collins\n13.\t&quot;Interlude: Hey Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:10\n14.\t&quot;Escapade&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n15.\t&quot;Interlude: No Acid&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:05\n16.\t&quot;Black Cat&quot; (Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50\n17.\t&quot;Lonely&quot; (James Harris III, Terry Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n18.\t&quot;Come Back to Me&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n19.\t&quot;Someday Is Tonight&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00\n20.\t&quot;Interlude: Livin'...In Complete Darkness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanet 1993\n\n\n\njanet. is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on May 18, 1993 by Virgin Records. Jackson shares co-writing and production credits with long-term collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, as well as Jellybean Johnson. The album was the first to be released under Jackson's new label, as she had departed from A&amp;M Records for a then-unprecedented multi-million dollar contract with Virgin in 1991.\n\nThe album's title, &quot;Janet, period.&quot;, is meant to disassociate the singer's public image from that of her family, essentially dropping the Jackson surname. While the singer had once garnered a reputation as an advocate for sexual abstinence with her 1986 single &quot;Let's Wait Awhile&quot;, the theme of janet. is sexual intimacy. Though the album was considered to be less innovative than Jackson's previous effortsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989) and Control (1986)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½critical reception was predominately positive. The album's music contains a softer, sensual tone compared to that of Jackson's previous albums, and because she took a greater role as producer, janet. has been credited as a truer testament of independence than Control.\n\njanet. debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming Jackson's third consecutive album to top the chart. The album produced six top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. &quot;That's the Way Love Goes&quot; won the 1994 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song and &quot;Again&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½featured on the soundtrack of Jackson's debut feature film Poetic JusticeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The supporting janet. Tour received critical acclaim for Jackson's elaborate stage performances. The Recording Industry Association of America has certified janet. 9ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ platinum and the album has sold over 20 million units worldwide.[3] janet. is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time.[4]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Morning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:31\n2.\t&quot;That's the Way Love Goes&quot; (Janet Jackson, James Harris III, Terry Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n3.\t&quot;You Know...&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:12\n4.\t&quot;You Want This&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n5.\t&quot;Be a Good Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:07\n6.\t&quot;If&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n7.\t&quot;Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:04\n8.\t&quot;This Time&quot; (featuring soprano by Kathleen Battle) (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:58\n9.\t&quot;Go on Miss Janet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:05\n10.\t&quot;Throb&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n11.\t&quot;What'll I Do&quot; (Jackson, Steve Cropper, Joe Shamwell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n12.\t&quot;The Lounge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:15\n13.\t&quot;Funky Big Band&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n14.\t&quot;Racism&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:08\n15.\t&quot;New Agenda&quot; (featuring rap by Chuck D) (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n16.\t&quot;Love Pt. 2&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:11\n17.\t&quot;Because of Love&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n18.\t&quot;Wind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:11\n19.\t&quot;Again&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n20.\t&quot;Another Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:11\n21.\t&quot;Where Are You Now&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n22.\t&quot;Hold on Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:10\n23.\t&quot;The Body That Loves You&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n24.\t&quot;Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:18\n25.\t&quot;Any Time, Any Place&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08\n26.\t&quot;Are You Still Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:36\n27.\t&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;/&quot;Whoops Now&quot; (Jackson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Velvet Rope 1997\n\n\n\nThe Velvet Rope is the sixth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released October 6, 1997 by Virgin Records. Prior to the album's release, Jackson renewed her recording contract with Virgin Records for unprecedented $80 million dollars in January 1996, establishing her as the then-highest paid recording artist in contemporary music. The Velvet Rope was produced and co-written by long-term collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; Jackson and her then-husband RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Elizondo, Jr. served as executive producers.\n\nDuring the two years prior to the release of The Velvet Rope, Jackson struggled with a long-term case of depression. As a result, she frequently took time off during the recording of the album or abruptly left the studio during recording sessions. The Velvet Rope became a concept album based on Jackson's embrace and disillusionment with her status as a celebrity. Though Jackson introduced sexuality into her music with her previous album janet. (1993), The Velvet Rope takes the concept a step further, encompassing sadomasochism and same-sex relationships as lyrical content.\n\nThe Velvet Rope debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming Jackson's fourth consecutive album to top the chart, selling over eight million copies worldwide.[3] The Recording Industry Association of America has certified The Velvet Rope triple platinum. The Velvet Rope was named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[4]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Interlude: Twisted Elegance&quot; (Janet Jackson, James Harris III, Terry Lewis, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Elizondo, Jr.) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:41\n2.\t&quot;Velvet Rope&quot; (featuring Vanessa-Mae) (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo, Malcolm McLaren, Trevor Horn, Mike Oldfield) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n3.\t&quot;You&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo, Harold Brown, Sylvester Allen, Morris Dickerson, Howard Scott, Leroy Jordan, Lee Oskar, Charles Miller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n4.\t&quot;Got 'til It's Gone&quot; (featuring Q-Tip and Joni Mitchell) (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo, Joni Mitchell, Kamaal Ibn Fareed) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n5.\t&quot;Interlude: Speaker Phone&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:54\n6.\t&quot;My Need&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo, Marilyn McLeod, Pam Sawyer, Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n7.\t&quot;Interlude: Fasten Your Seatbelts&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:19\n8.\t&quot;Go Deep&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n9.\t&quot;Free Xone&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo, James Brown, Billy Buttier, Archie Bell, Michael Hepburn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n10.\t&quot;Interlude: Memory&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:04\n11.\t&quot;Together Again&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n12.\t&quot;Interlude: Online&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:19\n13.\t&quot;Empty&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n14.\t&quot;Interlude: Full&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:12\n15.\t&quot;What About&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n16.\t&quot;Every Time&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n17.\t&quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; (Rod Stewart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n18.\t&quot;I Get Lonely&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n19.\t&quot;Rope Burn&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n20.\t&quot;Anything&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n21.\t&quot;Interlude: Sad&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:10\n22.\t&quot;Special&quot;/&quot;Can't Be Stopped&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Elizondo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll For You 2001\n\n\nAll for You is the seventh studio album (tenth overall) by American R&amp;B-pop singer Janet Jackson, released in the United States on April 24, 2001 by Virgin Records. Unlike The Velvet Rope, which saw Jackson tackling darker issues like domestic violence and depression, All for You showcased a fluffier pop sound with lyrics talking mostly about her then-recent divorce. First pressings of the album did not contain a Parental Advisory warning on it, and a clean version was not offered, despite strong language and sexual content. Subsequent pressings of the album did in fact have a Parental Advisory warning on it, and a clean version was then issued, which omitted the track &quot;Would You Mind?&quot;. This situation drew many comparisons to Jennifer Lopez's album, J.Lo, as the same thing happened with that album. The album marked Jackson's first album to be released with a Parental Advisory label on it; the second being follow-up Damita Jo. The album became Jackson's fifth consecutive album to debut atop the Billboard 200 chart, selling 605,000 units in its opening week, and shipped over 1.8 million units in its first week in the US.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59\n2.\t&quot;You Ain't Right&quot; (Janet Jackson, James Harris III, Terry Lewis, Dana Stinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n3.\t&quot;All for You&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, David Romani, Wayne Garfield, Mauro Malavasi) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29 \no\tContains a sample of Change's &quot;The Glow of Love&quot; (David Romani, Wayne Garfield, Mauro Malavasi)\n4.\t&quot;2wayforyou (Interlude)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:19\n5.\t&quot;Come On Get Up&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Stinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n6.\t&quot;When We Oooo&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n7.\t&quot;China Love&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) \no\tContains a sample from the Square game &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n8.\t&quot;Love Scene (Ooh Baby)&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n9.\t&quot;Would You Mind&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Stinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31 \no\tNot included on the clean version or DVD edition of the album\n10.\t&quot;Lame (Interlude)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:11\n11.\t&quot;Trust a Try&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Stinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n12.\t&quot;Clouds (Interlude)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:19\n13.\t&quot;Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)&quot; (with Carly Simon) (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Carly Simon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:56 \no\tContains a sample of Carly Simon's &quot;You're So Vain&quot; (Carly Simon)\n14.\t&quot;Truth&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, James Wright, Stan Vincent) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:44\n15.\t&quot;Theory (Interlude)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:26\n16.\t&quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Dewey Bunnell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32 \no\tContains a sample of America's &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; (Dewey Bunnell)\n17.\t&quot;Feels So Right&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis, Stinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n18.\t&quot;Doesn't Really Matter&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n19.\t&quot;Better Days&quot; (Jackson, Harris, Lewis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n20.\t&quot;Outro&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamita Jo 2004\n\n\n\nDamita Jo is the eighth studio album (eleventh overall) by American R&amp;B-pop singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter Janet Jackson, released in the United States on March 30, 2004 by Virgin Records. The album takes its title from Jackson's middle name. This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.\n\nReleased during the hectic period in which Jackson had generated heat for her Super Bowl XXXVIII fallout the previous month, Damita Jo was considered a major sales disappointment compared to Jackson's previous efforts, although it debuted strongly at number two on the Billboard 200 with approximately 381,000 copies sold (behind Usher's Confessions, which sold 486,000 copies that week),[2] and went on to be certified platinum in late May 2004. The majority of reviews were somewhat negative, with critics pointing out either the controversy over the Super Bowl or the highly sexual nature of some of the songs, which were composed well before the incident.\n\nDespite the fact that the singles released were virtually ignored by pop radio, as none of its singles reached the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an odd absence considering Jackson's pop-friendly appealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and aimed heavily at urban radio, Jackson found success mostly on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts, reaching number eighteen on the R&amp;B chart with the Motown/Supremes-inspired, Kanye West-assisted ballad &quot;I Want You&quot; while the Prince-influenced &quot;Just a Little While&quot; and the funk danceable number &quot;All Nite (Don't Stop)&quot; topped the dance chart. The former has since been certified platinum by the RIAA as has the album, which sold over 2.4 million copies worldwide.[3] &quot;R&amp;B Junkie&quot;, the final single, only managed to reach number one on the Bubbling Under R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles (roughly corresponding to number one hundred and one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs) due to the fact that the song was released for promo only after its physical release was canceled.\n\nThe album earned Jackson two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;I Want You&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Looking for Love&quot; (Janet Jackson, David Ritz, Fabrice Dumont, Christophe Hetier, Stephan Haeri) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:29\n2.\t&quot;Damita Jo&quot; (Jackson, James Harris III, Terry Lewis, Bobby Ross Avila, Issiah J.

It was her only album released for Island Records (under the same parent as her first label), after her five-album deal with Virgin Records was fulfilled with the release of 20 Y.O. Jackson worked with producers such as Darkchild, Jermaine Dupri, Ne-Yo, Shea Taylor, Stargate, Johnta Austin, Tricky Stewart, and The-Dream on the album. Jackson's long-time producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, did not contribute to the project. The album was executively produced by Island Urban president Jermaine Dupri and Jackson.\nFour singles were released from the album; the first, &quot;Feedback&quot;, was released as a digital download in December 2007. The song reached number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Jackson's best-charting single since 2001's &quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot;. The album's later singles did not share the success of &quot;Feedback&quot;. The deluxe version of Discipline contained a DVD documenting the production and promotion of the album and music videos.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews, with critics arguing that it was an improvement on Jackson's two previous albums. Despite positive reviews it became one of her least successful albums. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming her sixth to top the chart. However, sales of the album quickly fell, and by June the album's promotion had officially ended. Jackson started her Rock Witchu TourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the support of Live NationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in early September to positive reviews but by the end of that month Jackson parted company with her record label. As of September 2009, sales of the album stand at 446,000 copies in the U.S.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;I.D.&quot; (Rodney Jerkins, Dernst Emile) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47\n2.\t&quot;Feedback&quot; (Jerkins, Emile, Tasleema Yasin, LaShawn Daniels) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n3.\t&quot;Luv&quot; (Jerkins, Emile, Yasin, Daniels) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n4.\t&quot;Spinnin&quot; (Jerkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:07\n5.\t&quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (Jerkins, Theron Thomas, Timothy Thomas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n6.\t&quot;Bathroom Break&quot; (Jerkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:40\n7.\t&quot;Rock with U&quot; (Shaffer Smith, Jermaine Dupri, Eric Stamile) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n8.\t&quot;2nite&quot; (Phillip &quot;Taj&quot; Jackson, Mikkel S.

It was certified double platinum by the RIAA in 1995, and has since sold nearly 10 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nThe album features six of Jackson's hits from Control, seven songs from Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, one song from janet., and two previously unreleased songs, the top five hit &quot;Runaway&quot; and the mid-tempo ballad &quot;Twenty Foreplay&quot;. A video compilation, featuring all the songs on the album (with the exception of &quot;Twenty Foreplay&quot;), was released concurrently with the album.\n\nOwing to licensing difficulties, several later singles that were big hitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Any Time, Any Place&quot;, &quot;Because of Love&quot;, and &quot;You Want This&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were omitted from the track listing. Other singles that failed to make the cut included the UK single &quot;Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)&quot; (from 1986's Control). Several tracks were shortened in order to include &quot;Whoops Now&quot; and &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; on the international release.\n\nThe album was released as an 18-track disc internationally and as a 16-track disc in the U.S. (omitting Whoops Now and The Best Things in Life Are Free). Some versions of the international edition came with a 7-track bonus disc. This bonus disc was also released individually in Australia. Another limited edition version, housed in a metal case and containing the 18-track version of the album, was released in the UK.\n\nIn the booklet, it shows the lyrics to only the new songs, it shows a mini-biography about Janet, it shows different pictures of her from the times of Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. It also shows the covers of the singles for the new songs when it shows the lyrics and song credits for the new songs.\n\nIn promoting the album, A&amp;M re-released the singles &quot;The Best Things In Life Are Free&quot;, &quot;When I Think Of You&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, and &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; with brand new remixes. A re-release was planned for &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot;, but was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Runaway&quot; 4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n2.\t&quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n3.\t&quot;Nasty&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n4.\t&quot;When I Think of You&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n5.\t&quot;Escapade&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n6.\t&quot;Miss You Much&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n7.\t&quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n8.\t&quot;Alright&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n9.\t&quot;Control&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n10.\t&quot;The Pleasure Principle (Design of a Decade 1986/1996 edit)&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n11.\t&quot;Black Cat&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n12.\t&quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n13.\t&quot;That's the Way Love Goes&quot; 3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n14.\t&quot;Come Back to Me&quot; 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38\n15.\t&quot;Let's Wait Awhile&quot; 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n16.\t&quot;Twenty Foreplay&quot; 4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:476746fdc24449908326fcf90bd9dcff20fc5c0f","amp;dn":"Janet+Jackson+-+8+Albums+%28inc+Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"476746fdc24449908326fcf90bd9dcff20fc5c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,103,70,253,194,68,73,144,131,38,252,249,11,217,220,255,32,252,92,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
