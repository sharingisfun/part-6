As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the vocalist's role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations, as many of his songs became popular standards and his best albums became undisputed classics of the rock &amp; roll canon. Dylan's influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the '80s and '90s, Dylan's presence rarely lagged, and his commercial revival in the 2000s proved his staying power. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.Things Have Changed\n02.She Belongs To Me\n03.Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\n04.Working Man's Blues #2\n05.Waiting For You\n06.Duquesne Whistle\n07.Pay In Blood\n08.Tangled Up In Blue\n09.Love Sick\n10.High Water (For Charley Patton)\n11.Simple Twist Of Fate\n12.Early Roman Kings\n13.Forgetful Heart\n14.Spirit On The Water\n15.Scarlet Town\n16.Soon After Midnight\n17.Long And Wasted Years\n18.All Along The Watchtower\n19.Blowin' In The Wind\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:307986b479f7dbd29279066cdced0e6d6b5bd32f","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Live+At+Flensburg+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"307986b479f7dbd29279066cdced0e6d6b5bd32f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,121,134,180,121,247,219,210,146,121,6,108,220,237,14,109,107,91,211,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
