Python, an easy-to-learn and increasingly popular object-oriented language, allows readers to become comfortable with the fundamentals of programming without the troublesome syntax that can be challenging for novices. With the knowledge acquired using Python, students gain confidence in their skills and learn to recognize the logic behind developing high-quality programs.\n\nStarting Out with Python discusses control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers before objects and classes. As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, detail-oriented explanations, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter. This text is intended for a one-semester introductory programming course for students with limited programming experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2be806ca4726cfc6234f60cc50e5477738a8b25","amp;dn":"Starting+Out+with+Python+-+2nd+Edition+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2be806ca4726cfc6234f60cc50e5477738a8b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,190,128,108,164,114,108,252,98,52,246,12,197,14,84,119,115,138,139,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
