Chris Impey leads the reader through the history, from the Copernican revolution to the emergence of the field of astrobiology - the study of life in the cosmos. He examines how life on Earth began, exploring its incredible variety and the extreme environments in which it can survive. Finally, Impey turns his attention to our Solar System and the planets beyond, discussing whether there may be life elsewhere in the Universe. Written in non-technical language, this book is ideal for anyone wanting to know more about astrobiology and how it is changing our views of life and the Universe. An accompanying website available at www.cambridge.org/9780521173841 features podcasts, articles and news stories on astrobiology.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 415 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; First Edition 2007\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0805858571\nISBN-13: 978-0521847803\nASIN: 0521173841\n\n\n!!
