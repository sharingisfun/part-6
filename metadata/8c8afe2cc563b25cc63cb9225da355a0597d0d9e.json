Produced by Guy Sigsworth (Bjork, Madonna, Seal) and Joe Chiccarelli (Tori Amos, Elton John, My Morning Jacket, U2) and recorded in Los Angeles, the album marks the songstress' first release in four years.\n&quot;This record, as always, is a snapshot of what I currently obsess about, care about, and what strikes me at 4 in the morning in my most introspective moments,&quot; says Morissette. &quot;It is my emotional, psychological, social and philosophical commentary through song. I can't wait to share it with this fun and funny planet, and to tour, and can't WAIT to have the lively, engaging and challenging conversations that these songs may invite.&quot; \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8afe2cc563b25cc63cb9225da355a0597d0d9e","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morissette+-+Havoc+and+Bright+Lights+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8afe2cc563b25cc63cb9225da355a0597d0d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,138,254,44,197,99,178,92,198,60,185,34,93,163,85,160,89,125,13,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
