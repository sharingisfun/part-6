It was released in 1993 and is considered one of the very first albums of britpop, predating even Oasis. Surely, Oasis are better, but I think this album stands out as well :)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122ffe3f343e05e7c7175eb986e20e2fcc2a8f20","amp;dn":"Blur+-+Modern+Life+Is+Rubbish+album%2C+1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122ffe3f343e05e7c7175eb986e20e2fcc2a8f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,47,254,63,52,62,5,231,199,23,94,185,134,226,14,47,204,42,143,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
