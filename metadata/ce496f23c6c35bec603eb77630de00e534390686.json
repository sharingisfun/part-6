During the broadcast, Comedy Central went unchallenged as the highest ranked channel on the DStv bouquet in terms of ratings and audience share, with nearly one in four Premium viewers aged 20-49 tuning in to watch.\n\nHallmarks of the first Comedy Central Roast to take place on African soil are a pimped out traditional ossewa (ox-wagon), a BBQ shaped throne and a deluge of cutting jokes, comic jabs and over-the-top insults.  Roastmaster Trevor Noah and roasters Casper de Vries, Kuli Roberts, Shaleen Surti-Richards, Anele Mdoda, David Kau, Minki van der Westhuizen and John Vlismas queue up to hurl dubious tributes and hilarious slurs at Hofmeyr, described by Noah in his introduction as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most loved and hated man in SAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nA celeb-packed audience was on hand to watch Hofmeyr triumphantly enter the stage of The Lyric Theatre towed by eight leggy Blue Bulls cheerleaders to a deafening chorus from his hit track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baas Van Die PlaasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boss of the FarmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nAmong the audience were: Blue Bulls captain and Springbok player Pierre Spies; musicians Chris Chameleon, HHP, Simphiwe Dana, DJ Kent, Louise Carver, ChianoSky, Reason, DJ Euphonik and Glenn from The Parlotones; radio personalities Azania Mosaka, Poppy Ntshongwana, Sureshnie Rider and Thomas Msengana; designer Marianne Fassler; model Sashi Naidoo; TV presenter Elma Smit; Ã¢â‚¬Å“IdolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ judge Unathi Msengana; comedians  Joe Parker, Chris Forrest, Tumi Morake, Loyiso Gola, Conrad Koch, David Kibuuka, Kagiso Ledigo, Tshepo, Mogale and Kedibone Mulaudzi, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sevende LaanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Amalia Uys and  Motlatsi Mafatshe; MTV Base VJ Sizwe Dhlomo; Ashish Gandrapasad from Ã¢â‚¬Å“IsidingoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Tumisho Masha, Ty Keogh and Hayley Owen from Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Siya B fromÃ¢â‚¬Å“GenerationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and Clint Brink, Lorcia Cooper and Dawn Matthews from Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScandalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nHighlights of the hard-hitting comedy evening include a running gag between Trevor Noah and David Kau about joke-stealing.  Addressing Noah (who famously appeared on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tonight with Jay LenoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ earlier this year), Kau says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“People are always asking me when I am going to appear on Jay Leno, but I tell them, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to go on it  - my jokes have already appeared on Leno.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA dapper, kilt-clad actor Robert Whitehead, a.k.a Ã¢â‚¬Å“IsidingoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s notorious villain Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barker HainesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, sets the tone for the evening, flashing at Hofmeyr and getting the audience rocking with laughter by reading through a mock Ã¢â‚¬Å“contractÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which allegedly listed all the rude names he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t permitted to call Steve Hofmeyer.\n\nAcerbic comic John Vlismas kicks off his own Ã¢â‚¬Å“tributeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by parodying Mark AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous speech from ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Julius CaesarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, starting with the phrase, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I come to bury Steve, not to praise himÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, before going on to mock HofmeyrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous gesture when he threw 5,000 Rand worth of U2 tickets in Jukskei river.\n\nShaleen Surti-Richards uses her speech to reveal a hitherto unsuspected crush on Steve Hofmeyr, expressing her disgust that the reputed womaniser has never tried it on with her on the set of Egoli when they worked together.  Surti-Richards finishes her speech by flinging a giant pair of ladies knickers at the singer..\n\nJournalist and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeadlinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ entertainment reporter Kuli Roberts riffs on the subject of HofmeyrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical success, as SAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling artist, but asking the question, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who the |Ã¢â‚¬Â¦] is buying these records?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nModel Minki van der Westhuizen crowns her speech - in which she reminisces about being chatted up by Steve Hofmeyr at the age of 18 - by thanking Hofmeyr, saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“If it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for you, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be the dumbest blond in South African showbusiness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA blue-suited Hofmeyr, seated throughout the show on a BBQ Ã¢â‚¬Å“throneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, provocatively tricked out in the colours of the flag of the old Republic, appears to take the endless ribbing in good humour, smiling through japes about his broken marriage, his serial infidelity, his illegitimate children, his right wing politics, his derivative singing style and his outdated fashion sense.  The singer looks like losing his cool only once - during John VlismasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ address - when the Ã¢â‚¬Å“PampoenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ singer crosses the stage and attempts to make Vlismas Ã¢â‚¬ËœeatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ his words.\n\nAlthough being billed as the Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½RoastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Hofmeyr himself, none of the participants get off lightly at the event as insults fly thick and fast around The Lyric TheatreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s red and gold interior.\n\nComments Alex Okosi, Senior Vice President &amp; Managing Director, Viacom International Media Networks Africa, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are delighted to push boundaries by versioning this classic Comedy Central franchise for a South African audience and context.
