Rudderless and remorseful, Richard embarks on a series of misguided attempts to win Anne back while focusing his creative energy on a provocative art piece to prove that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still the man she once loved.\n\nSkillfully balancing biting wit with a deep emotional undercurrent, this Ã¢â‚¬Å“charming and engrossing portrait of one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s midlife messÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Elle) creates the perfect portrait of an imperfect familyÃ¢â‚¬â€and a heartfelt exploration of marriage, love, and fidelity.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2014: One way to read Courtney MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funny, smart, frothy first novel is as a primer on why cheating on your spouse is a terrible idea--especially when your wife is beautiful, and French, and a lawyer, and the mother of your child, and she loves you. Another take: monogamy is hard and, as the protagonist puts it, sometimes we need a Ã¢â‚¬Å“secret line to something private.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Or maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a lame excuse for self-indulgence. Richard Haddon is a British artist living the perfect ex-patÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life with his wife, Anne, and daughter in Paris. When his mistress dumps him, and Anne learns of the affair, he struggles not only to win her back, but to revive his passion for fidelity. Richard can be a maddening doofus, and whether you root for him or not may depend on your taste for rom-com sweetness. (ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a written-for-the-screen quality at work here; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already mentally cast Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.) What lifts the novel above the love lost and found tale is MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well-drawn cast of quirky supporting characters and her exploration of the creative process, primarily RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt to rediscover himself as an artist. Is it better to create safe, commercial art and take care of your family or take a risk on art that matters? And is a U.S. passport in a washing machine full of oil a brilliant anti-war protest or just weird? At the core of this clever debut is a bigger question: how do you recover from infidelity and become a better man? --Neal Thompson\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Courtney Maum bursts onto the scene with a hilarious and wise novel. . . . Richard Haddon is one of the more lovable male characters we've encountered this season. . . . You'll find yourself agog at Maum's masterful storytelling and dead-on descriptions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Glamour)\n\n&quot;A charming and engrossing portrait of one man's midlife mess . . . Smart, fast-paced . . . You come for the plot, but you stay for the charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€especially Maum's flawed but likable and basically well-intentioned hero. Ultimately, this is the story of a man who would do anything to be a better person, and you will avidly wish for him to succeed.&quot; (Elle)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[An] affably comic take on husbandly comeuppance, Courtney MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You follows a once-sizzling British artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilariously misguided efforts to win back the love of his wife.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Vogue)\n\n&quot;Need[s] to be in your beach bag.&quot; (Marie Claire)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Courtney Maum kills it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Vanity Fair)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hit the beach (or the backyard) with [this] can't-put-down novel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Daily News)\n\n&quot;A very funny comedy of modern manners.&quot; (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raw honesty about the hard work of long-term relationships, what is said and left unsaid, and her intimate knowledge of Paris make this a bittersweet yet comical read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Minneapolis Star-Tribune)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Maum is beautifully clear-eyed about the ways we fail each other and ourselves. . . . Zinging like Lorrie Moore . . . the narrative takes satisfyingly unexpected turns. . . . Rarely is a novel this funny quite so dark, but Maum takes that risk with substantial payoff. . . . This is a novel that remains stubbornly honest and optimistic about love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Brooklyn Rail)\n\n&quot;Maum is awesome enough to cop to working as a Corona Extra party promoter in her official author bio, and funny enough to be the humor columnist for Electric Literature. Read this if your vacation plans sadly do not include hanging out with eccentric, upwardly mobile Euros.&quot; (Nylon)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The giant, thumping heart of Courtney MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut novel beats loud and fast from its very first pages. . . . With wit and humor, Maum brings RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lopsided love story to life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Set in Paris and London, I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You is precisely the type of book you should be reading this summer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Flavorwire.com)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Told with cutting wit and deep emotion, this is a heartfelt look at love and fidelity in the contemporary era.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Fodors.com, Ã¢â‚¬Å“10 Books to Read on Your Summer VacationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An honest, staggeringly realized journey . . . Equally funny and touching, the novel strikes deep, presenting a sincere exploration of love and monogamy. These characters are complex, and their story reflects their confusion and desire. . . . An impressive, smart novel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Publishers Weekly (starred review))\n\n&quot;MaumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale deftly captures a thirtysomethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of grief for the lost passion of youth and the search for something of depth to take its place. Writing with an authentic and affecting vulnerability, Maum considers sentimentality from every possible angleÃ¢â‚¬â€interpersonal relationships, lofty idealism, and artÃ¢â‚¬â€and each receives an equally unflinching examination. An unapologetically thoughtful novel told without melodrama and with a lot of heart.&quot; (Booklist)\n\n&quot;[A] realistic portrayal of a modern marriage that has lost its way . . . Solid, well-written.&quot; (Library Journal)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Courtney Maum has crafted the story of a relationship so believable, so realistic that readers will be left wondering until the last minute whether the couple will reunite. . . . . The razor-sharp writing and character insights of I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You suggest that readers have much to look forward to from this talented storyteller.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (BookPage)\n\n&quot;Set mainly in Paris, this love story for grown-ups tells the story of a decent man who almost ruins his life and then goes to great lengths to restore his marriage. If your path to a happy marriage has been straight-forward, you may not appreciate this book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect for the rest of us!&quot; (LibraryReads (June 2014 Pick))\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes a book's characters grab you by the heart and make you ache with understanding and anticipation. You will laugh, wince, and relate as Maum's debut plunges you into a visceral experience with her characters that is both familiar and agonizing. Love, trust, and creative expression are explored as a French lawyer and a British artist grapple with whether love can be rebuilt after betrayal. Gripping!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (IndieNext (June 2014 Pick))\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is such a discovery. . . . ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of a love story in reverse. . . . Really gorgeously written.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Leigh Haber, O Magazine Books Editor)\n\n&quot;A gem of a novel about the tangles of love, regret, and hope that might or might not hold a marriage together. Courtney Maum's deft, beguiling debut charms with its wit and glows with compassion.&quot; (Maggie Shipstead, author of Seating Arrangements)\n\n&quot;Courtney Maum writes with such honesty and verve about how we struggle to deserve the people we love. Intensely personal and engagingly complex, I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You is a moving, complicated, big-hearted novel.&quot; (Kevin Wilson, author of The Family Fang)\n\n&quot;Antic, sexy, satirically deft, and of course funny, this novel is also, on both the personal and political levels, smart about the bottomlessness of our capacities for self-sabotage, and moving about the fierceness of our yearning to make good.&quot; (Jim Shepard, author of You Think That's Bad and Like You'd Understand, Anyway)\n\n&quot;Maum's witty and insightful novel captures a lifetime of falling in and out of love. It's an investigation of marriage which often combines its utter clear-sightedness and its tremendous warmth in the very same sentence. So agile and fully realized.&quot; (Ned Beauman, author of The Teleportation Accident)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6a1d93644dbfa60c4eb3eefcf3c17a845d9d9d","amp;dn":"I+Am+Having+So+Much+Fun+Here+Without+You+-+Courtney+Maum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6a1d93644dbfa60c4eb3eefcf3c17a845d9d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,106,29,147,100,77,191,166,12,78,179,238,252,243,193,122,132,93,157,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
