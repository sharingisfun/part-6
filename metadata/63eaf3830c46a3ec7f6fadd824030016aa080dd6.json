The patterns are organized from simple to difficult and their origins range from traditional Scandinavian and Canadian Maritime patterns to more contemporary sewn and windblock patterns from right here in Maine. Rounding out the patterns is useful information on caring for and repairing woolens; tips for adding details such as buttons, straps, or leather palms to mittens; and a list of yarn suppliers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63eaf3830c46a3ec7f6fadd824030016aa080dd6","amp;dn":"Knitting+Ultimate+Mittens%3A+28+Classic+Patterns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63eaf3830c46a3ec7f6fadd824030016aa080dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,234,243,131,12,70,163,236,127,111,173,216,36,3,0,22,170,8,13,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
