The Guitar Encyclopedia begins with the history of guitars spanning back to the birth of Epiphone by a Greek immigrant and the great inventions of Les Paul, to the boom of the Rock-'n-Roll-shredder days with Ibanez guitars and the futuristic designs of the Gibson Moderne and the Randy Rhodes Polka Dot Flying V. The book also contains interviews from guitar designers such as Fender and Eastwood, as well as boutique companies such as Gander and Specimen.\nA far cry from other dry schematic encyclopedias, this book details the connections between different guitars and the monumental recordings that they produced. With introductions by Gary Hoey, Chris Poland (Megadeth), and Eric Shoaf (Vintage Guitar magazine), this book provides a rich and unique account of iconic guitars throughout history.\n\n\nBy Brian Tarquin\nPublished by Allworth Press in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 256 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94b1af0c6ad94309ea2457225b7539f83aae610","amp;dn":"Guitar+Encyclopedia+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94b1af0c6ad94309ea2457225b7539f83aae610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,75,26,240,198,173,148,48,158,162,69,114,37,183,83,159,131,170,230,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
