Persians under\nthe rule of King Xerxes have already taken over some of the Hellenic city-states,\nand now threaten Sparta and Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta is left with two\noptions: he will either have to sacrifice himself for the well-being of Sparta\nor watch it burn to the ground. Choosing the former, Leonidas forms an army of\n300 Spartan warriors to block the narrow passage of Thermopylae where Xerxes\nintends to reach Hellas. The 300 are accompanied by about 700 Thespians who\nprotect the flanks of the passage, and combined, the forces manage to slay tens\nof thousands of Persians and prevent their entry into Hellas for several days.\nHowever, Ephialtes, a reject of the Spartan Army gets his revenge by showing\nXerxes a secret goat passage up the flanks of the passage. The story depicts\nthe epic last stand of the finest Spartan soldiers who are aware of their fate,\nbut motivated by honor and glory, see the battle as their duty to protect the\nrest of Greece for as long as possible.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Gerard Butler.\n=&gt;-Lena Headey.\n=&gt;-David Wenham.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Zack Snyder.\n\n300 Rise of an Empire.\nAfter its victory over Leonidas' 300, the Persian Army under the command of\nXerxes marches towards the major Greek city-states. The Democratic city of Athens,\nfirst on the path of Xerxes' army, bases its strength on its fleet, led by admiral\nThemistocles. Themistocles is forced to an unwilling alliance with the traditional\nrival of Athens, oligarchic Sparta whose might lies with its superior infantry\ntroops. But Xerxes still reigns supreme in numbers over sea and land.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sullivan Stapleton.\n=&gt;-Eva Green.\n=&gt;-Lena Headey.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Noam Murro.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre : Action : Fantasy : War.\n=&gt;-Release Date : 2006 : 2014.\n=&gt;-Language : English.\n=&gt;-File Size : 1.41 GiB : 1.24 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate : 1 733 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime : 1h 56mn : 1h 42mn.\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec : H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio : 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution : 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate : 1 600 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 234 Kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a7c524ce79fd2ffdf50e2c05e4433007d2f24c","amp;dn":"300%2C+300+Rise+of+an+Empire+-+Duology+Action+Eng+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a7c524ce79fd2ffdf50e2c05e4433007d2f24c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,167,197,36,206,121,253,47,253,245,14,44,5,228,67,48,7,210,242,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
