As the main songwriter, Edenloff will bring a song or idea to the table for the band to take it apart and build it back up. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSince the songs tend to hinge on the interplay between the drums and the vocals/lead instrument it can sometimes take a lot of the time to find that fundamental core of the song before we can really move forward with it. Sometimes this might mean taking a song that was initially written on guitar and making it a keyboard song (i.e. &quot;The Breakup&quot;, &quot;Under the Knife&quot; and &quot;North Star&quot;) or taking a keyboard song and making it more of a guitar song (i.e. &quot;Tornado '87&quot;).&quot; says Edenloff.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Bringing closure to the exploration of themes of love, loss and leaving that began with Hometowns, Departing contains ten songs about growing up and moving on. \n\nTrack List:\n1. Two Lovers\n2. The Breakup\n3. Under The Knife\n4. Muscle Relaxants\n5. North Star\n6. Stamp\n7. Tornado '87\n8. Barnes' Yard\n9. Coldest Days\n10.
