The Outlaws in 1976. The songs in this packaged product weren't new -- the album contained previously released material by Jennings, Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jennings' wife Jessi Colter (who had hit the charts a year earlier with &quot;I'm Not Lisa&quot;). But it marked the industry's recognition of the changing times, and as the center point of a campaign to publicize Nashville's new &quot;progressive&quot; breed, it worked like a charm. It quickly became the first country album to sell more than a million copies, and it boosted the careers of all involved.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea280cabc7330b264de2646cf709f8c6959790a","amp;dn":"Waylon+Jennings+Willie+Nelson+Jessi+Colter+Tompall+Glaser+-+Want","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea280cabc7330b264de2646cf709f8c6959790a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,162,128,202,188,115,48,178,100,222,38,70,207,112,159,140,105,89,121,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
