The album also heralded a dramatic maturation in the band's music, away \nfrom the synth pop brand with which it was (unjustly) seared following the \ndebut, and towards a complex, enveloping pop sophistication. The songwriting of \nOrzabal, Smith, and keyboardist Ian Stanley took a huge leap forward, drawing on \nreserves of palpable emotion and lovely, protracted melodies that draw just as \nmuch on soul and R&amp;B music as they do on immediate pop hooks. The album could \nalmost be called pseudo-conceptual, as each song holds its place and each is \nintegral to the overall tapestry, a single-minded resolve that is easy to \noverlook when an album is as commercially successful as Songs from the Big \nChair. And commercially successful it was, containing no less than three huge \ncommercial radio hits, including the dramatic and insistent march, &quot;Shout&quot; and \nthe shimmering, cascading &quot;Head Over Heels,&quot; which, tellingly, is actually part \nof a song suite on the album. Orzabal and Smith's penchant for theorizing with \nsteely-eyed austerity was mistaken for harsh bombasticism in some quarters, but \nseparated from its era, the album only seems earnestly passionate and immediate, \nand each song has the same driven intent and the same glistening remoteness. It \nis not only a commercial triumph, it is an artistic tour de force. And in the \nloping, percolating &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World,&quot; Tears for Fears \nperfectly captured the zeitgeist of the mid-'80s while impossibly managing to \nalso create a dreamy, timeless pop classic. Songs from the Big Chair is one of \nthe finest statements of the decade. [The deluxe edition, released in 2006, adds \nseven B-sides, the non-album A-side &quot;The Way You Are,&quot; and a dozen 7&quot; and 12&quot; \nmixes.] \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        SOME SONGS REVIEWED BY ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSHOUT\n\nSong Review\tby Chris True\n\nOne of the most recognizable songs from the mid-eighties, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShoutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (along with \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverybody Wants to Rule the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) became Tears for Fears signature moments \n(and became their second No. 1 U.S. single). For a band named after primal \nscream therapy, writing a song that wanted to protest the madness going on \naround them by,well, shouting, makes perfect sense. So in one respect, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ntheir signature song because it sums up the purpose of the band (up to that \npoint) so well. In another, its a signature song because of its utter \nsimplicity. Driven by its percussion track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShoutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ adds layer after layer as \nthe song progresses, but never strays from its purpose or gets weighted down by \ncomplex structures. The melodies remain simple even in the solos, the production \nnever gets out of control. With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShout,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Tears for Fears had found the most \ndirect way to create a call-to-arms song that would remain in the pop \nconsciousness for years. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEVERYBODY WANTS TO RULE THE WORLD\n\nSong Review\tby Stewart Mason\n\n&quot;Everybody Wants To Rule the World&quot; sounds like an entirely different band than \nthe mopey British duo that recorded 1983's pretty but pained The Hurting. It's \nbig, and anthemic, and it sounds, for lack of a better descriptive term, \nAmerican. Clearly, this song was designed for one main purpose: to crack the US \ncharts in a big way, which it in fact did. Opening with a pealing guitar \ncurlicue (and featuring not one but two hard-rocking guitar solos), the song \ndismisses the band's weedy synth-pop roots in favor of a more muscular sound. \nThe middle eight could come out of a Def Leppard song! Lyrically, the first \nalbum's obsessions with Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy are jettisoned in \nfavor of a more elliptical set of concerns. Frankly, the lyrics don't come \ntogether particularly well, but they sound good, and the chorus is a terrific \nsingalong. This is one of the best pure chart pop singles of 1985. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMOTHERS TALK\n\nSong Review\tby Stewart Mason\n\n&quot;Mothers Talk&quot; is by some distance the most dated-sounding song on Songs From \nThe Big Chair, consisting as it does primarily of booming gated drum samples and \nFairlight orchestral stabs under a kind of half-rapped Roland Orzabal lead \nvocal. It frankly sounds like a song that was half-written and added onto the \nalbum at the last moment as a filler track. That said, however, it actually fits \nperfectly on the album; coming at the end of side one, directly after the dreamy \n&quot;Everybody Wants To Rule the World&quot; (itself the third mid-tempo song in a row), \nthe uncharacteristic urgency of the call-and-response vocals and Curt Smith's \nconstricted-but-funky bass line (think of Fear of Music-era Talking Heads) \ndelivers a much-needed jolt of energy to the album. After the record company had \npulled three big hits out of the album, some bright bulb attempted a more \n&quot;normal&quot; sounding remix of &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; for US radio, but it was a complete \nbotch, reducing the song's already thin charms. This version is available as a \nbonus track on some CD versions of the album. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work \nin your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819fb384b1df53ad3fb7047939d21fa43795774e","amp;dn":"Tears+For+Fears+-+Songs+From+The+Big+Chair+%28Deluxe+2CD%29+%5BEAC-FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819fb384b1df53ad3fb7047939d21fa43795774e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,159,179,132,177,223,83,173,63,183,4,121,57,210,31,164,55,149,119,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
