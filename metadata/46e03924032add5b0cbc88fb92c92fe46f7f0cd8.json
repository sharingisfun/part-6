Many scientists believe that humans are to blame for climate change and have presented a great deal of scientific evidence that shows Earth's climate is warming at an alarming rate. Others claim that climatic changes are due to natural causes that have operated throughout Earth's history or that global warming is nothing but a hoax designed to scare people into changing their way of life. By examining the history and scientific facts behind climate change and the role humans may be playing in it, Global Warming and Climate Change gets to the heart of the controversy and allows readers to draw their own conclusions about one of the most important topics in science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e03924032add5b0cbc88fb92c92fe46f7f0cd8","amp;dn":"Science+Foundations+Global+Warming+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e03924032add5b0cbc88fb92c92fe46f7f0cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,224,57,36,3,42,221,91,12,188,136,251,146,201,47,228,111,127,12,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
