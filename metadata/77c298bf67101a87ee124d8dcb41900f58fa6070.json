He was called the greatest unknown guitarist in the world but a label like that suggests his music may have been technically proficient at the expense of being listenable. Not so as this cd demonstrates.\n\nOn this collection is some of the most soulful, uplifting guitar playing you could wish to hear along with great songs, many of them superb interpretations of classics, particularly &quot;Down by the River&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot;.\n\nThe thing you notice from photographs is that this guy did not look like a typical, cool guitar hero. Despite his appearance The Rolling Stones wanted him to be their new guitarist at one time. They knew what he was capable of. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images-jp.amazon.com/images/P/B000001DZQ.09.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images-jp.amazon.com/images/P/B000001DZQ.09.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1.
