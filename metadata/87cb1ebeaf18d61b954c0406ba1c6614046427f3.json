This record (once a double LP, now a single CD) wasn&amp;#039;t recorded live and the songs run a little shorter, but it shares the same sort of loose spirit and easy-rolling eclecticism as the two, essentially backed by the Family, run through a mess of country and pop standards. The latter makes up for the second half and its appropriately a little more subdued feel, but it&amp;#039;s earthier than Stardust and it makes a good companion for the irresistible first half, which is often cheerfully rowdy (particularly on the dynamite opening triptych of &quot;Detour,&quot; &quot;I Saw the Light,&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;) and convincingly bluesy on the ballads and mid-tempo groovers like the excellent &quot;Trouble in Mind.&quot; Both Nelson and Russell are known as sharp interpreters of other people&amp;#039;s material, and teamed together, they might not reinvent these songs (though they come close on &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;), but they infuse a lot of sound and spirit into these songs. It&amp;#039;s a little bit too laid-back and easy to qualify as a no-holds-barred classic (particularly on the second half), but that mellow charm is precisely why it&amp;#039;s a small, priceless gem for any serious fan of either singer. \n\n __ __________                    _________________________________________________\n\\ \\________//------------------\\______________________________________________//\n\n\n..\n:: Release Info:\n::\n:: Artist......&gt; Willie Nelson and Leon Russell\n:: Title.......&gt; One for the Road\n:: Label.......&gt; n/a\n:: Genre.......&gt; Country\n:: Rip.Date....&gt; 05.05.2008\n:: Street.Date.&gt; 03.01.2008\n:: Source......&gt; CDDA\n:: Quality.....&gt; VBR / avg. 177kbps / 44.1kHz / Joint-Stereo\n:: Encoder.....&gt; LAME 3.97/V2/VBRNEW\n:: URL.........&gt; n/a\n\n\n __ __________                    _________________________________________________\n\\ \\________//------------------\\______________________________________________//\n\n..\n:: Track Listing:\n::\n:: 01.

If you like Willie turning a song inside out\n::  and making you love it; you got it -- it&amp;#039;s all here.\n::\n::\n::  Despite equal billing, this is really a Willie Nelson album\n::  with Leon as his special guest. The songs are mostly, if not\n::  exclusively, covers of old songs. Many are from the Great\n::  American Songbook, but there are others including Heartbreak\n::  Hotel (Elvis Presley), Danny Boy (a traditional Irish folk\n::  song), I saw the light (Hank Williams) and Wild side of life\n::  (Hank Thompson).\n::\n::  In typical Willie Nelson style, many of these songs are done\n::  in a more laid-back style - this is particularly noticeable\n::  on Don&amp;#039;t fence me in (the Cole Porter song that was a huge\n::  success for Bing Crosby and the Andrews sisters) and\n::  Heartbreak hotel. Whether you enjoy these versions will\n::  depend on your personal taste. I enjoy them as a contrast to\n::  the originals, but the originals are still the best.\n::\n::  Willie and Leon are more in keeping with the originals on\n::  ballads such as Always (the Irving Berlin classic) and Far\n::  away places (one of my favorite Margaret Whiting songs).\n::\n\n __ __________          ____________________________________________________________\n\\ \\________//--------\\_________________________________________________________//\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87cb1ebeaf18d61b954c0406ba1c6614046427f3","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+%26+Leon+Russell-One+for+the+Road+%282008-Reissue-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87cb1ebeaf18d61b954c0406ba1c6614046427f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,203,30,190,175,24,214,27,149,76,4,6,186,28,102,20,4,100,39,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
