But just as the Marines root out the last violent dissenters, an alien ship of unknown origin suddenly flees Earth's orbit. Is it mere coincidence . . . or a terrifying omen?\n\nPresident Alexander Koenig watches with great interest as USNA forces chase the runaways down. But upon first contact, it's not apparent whereÃ¢â‚¬â€or whenÃ¢â‚¬â€the crew is headed. For this bizarre species has somehow mastered the power to manipulate time itself. Now Koenig must decide whether he's dealing with angels of astonishing technological prowess . . . or the agents of humanity's destruction.\n\nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 64 Kbps \nNarrated by: Nick Sullivan\nLength: 11 hrs and 40 mins \nSeries: Star Carrier, Book 6\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:05-26-15\nPublisher: Harper Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7fd0f858a954d9092f44222e8c02c75b390a65","amp;dn":"Ian+Douglas+-+Deep+Time+%28Star+Carrier+%236%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7fd0f858a954d9092f44222e8c02c75b390a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,127,208,248,88,169,84,217,9,47,68,34,46,140,2,199,91,57,10,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
