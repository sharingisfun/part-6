Sayre\nPublished: 2013\nPublisher: Pearson\nISBN: 9780205898879, 9780205887576\nFormat: Retail PDF\nNOTE: this is the standalone ebook and does not include access codes that may come with some versions of the bound book\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nHenry SayreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art appreciation text, The World of Art, is an amazing introduction to the world of art. Students with little background in the arts routinely reach out to Henry to share how the text has influenced their lives. This is so meaningful because HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inspiration for A World of Art was his own students. His students wanted to see themselves reflected in their textbook. Henry decided to write an art appreciation textbook that represented all artists, not just the Western canon found at that time in the other texts. He also created a text that fostered critical thinking through looking at, talking about, and questioning works of art for his students.\n\nThe result was A World of Art and the new seventh edition continues to build on those two themes- coverage of contemporary global art and a strong critical thinking framework throughout the text. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c52aaf9d99b3d1845b4ab1ef5aee4e0cdbe1198","amp;dn":"A+World+of+Art%2C+7E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c52aaf9d99b3d1845b4ab1ef5aee4e0cdbe1198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,82,170,249,217,155,61,24,69,180,171,30,245,174,228,224,205,190,17,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
