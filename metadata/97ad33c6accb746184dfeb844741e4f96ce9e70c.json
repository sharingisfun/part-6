The slow, mournful &quot;Tante Marie&quot; boasts two-sax horn parts and a moody guitar melody, the opening to Barthelemy Attisso's solo opening even sounds a little bit like something from the third Velvet Underground album, of all things. &quot;El Fuego&quot; has more of a Latin lilt and exceptionally good voices, while the horns and those vocal harmonies again really cut through on the highly infectious &quot;Digon.&quot; \n\nIt's hard to pinpoint precisely what makes Orchestra Baobab's vocal squad sound so special, probably a combination of the quality of the different voices and the unforced naturalness and sincerity of the singing. \n \n\nCD / 1992 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. El Son de Llama \n2. On Verra Ãƒâ€¡a \n3. Tante Marie \n4. Africa \n5. El Fuego \n6. Sibam \n7. Wane Ma Maguiss \n8. Thioisanne \n9. Mi Son \n10. Digon Gama \n\n\nIt's a highly enjoyable album and certainly put Orchestra Baobab on the road to the Bamba bomb. \n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ad33c6accb746184dfeb844741e4f96ce9e70c","amp;dn":"Orchestra+Baobab+-+On+Verra+%26Ccedil%3Ba+%21++%2F+The+Paris+Sessions+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ad33c6accb746184dfeb844741e4f96ce9e70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,173,51,198,172,203,116,97,132,223,235,132,71,65,228,249,108,233,231,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
