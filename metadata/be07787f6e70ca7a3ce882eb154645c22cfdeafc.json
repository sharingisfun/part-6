It gives me a quite a few more comics\nto update though.\n\n\nThe CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans \nthan posted within this collection, then\nplease leave a message and post up your comic scans.\n\nI will update this request list as I go along.\nThanks for helping!\n\n\n*******************************************\nScan Request of more recent colored published issues:\n\n*******************************************\n\n(Gold Key comics are not quite as good as original Dell comic.)\n\n* = german, italian comics available for scanlation\n\nSet 1:\n\nDD 4c0108 Seals are so Smart\nDD 4c0189 The Old Castle's Secret *\n\n*******************\nRequest list updated and transferred to CBDA Set 8 listing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be07787f6e70ca7a3ce882eb154645c22cfdeafc","amp;dn":"Carl+Barks+Digital+Archive+Set+1+version+2+of+12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be07787f6e70ca7a3ce882eb154645c22cfdeafc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,7,120,127,110,112,202,122,60,232,130,235,21,70,69,194,44,253,234,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
