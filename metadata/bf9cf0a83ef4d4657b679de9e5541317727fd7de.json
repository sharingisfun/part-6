Now, almost fully recovered but tortured by PTSD, he is working as a gofer for newcomer on the scene Fran, a mid-level cannabis and hooky cigarettes smuggler and loan shark. Meanwhile John Boy himself is spiralling. He's literally haunted by the death of his brother in the form of a mysterious ghostly figure he keeps seeing on the security CCTV system at his apartment stronghold. Profits are down in the ailing Irish economy and the police are closing in, the forensic accountants of C.A.B. seizing assets and generally making business impossible. John Boy plans to get his money out of the country and to retire to Spain, but his increasing cocaine use is making him more and more unpredictable and paranoid. All is not happy families with Nidge and his pregnant wife as he has an affair.\n\n\nWritten by Stuart Carolan.\n\nSeries 2 was nominated for 10 Irish Film &amp; Television Awards, winning 7 including Best Drama.\n\n\nCAST\nRobert Sheehan     ...

They did it the bad way and the DVDs of series 1 and 2 are full of blended frames that sometimes are blantantly visible while viewing the discs. The WS.PDTV releases are from native PAL broadcasts and don't have this issue.\n\nThese come from Irish Torrents dot com.
