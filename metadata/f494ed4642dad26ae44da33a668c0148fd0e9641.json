The album was recorded from August 1995 to July 1996 with a variety of producers including Timbaland, Missy Elliott, Carl-So-Lowe, J. Dibbs, Jermaine Dupri, Kay Gee, Vincent Herbert, Rodney Jerkins, Craig King, Darren Lighty, Darryl Simmons. The album featured several guest vocalists, including Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Treach, Slick Rick and Tank.  One in a Million received general critical acclaim from music critics, who complimented its &quot;depth&quot; compared to that of her debut album and Aaliyah's vocal performances, with some critics calling it &quot;smoother, more seductive, and stronger than before&quot; and praised the &quot;luxurious melodies and dreamy harmonies&quot;. Other critics called the album &quot;one of the most influential R&amp;B albums of the '90s&quot;, and it has been recognized by writers and music critics as redefining the genre coming into the late 1990s and solidifying Aaliyah's position as a key figure in R&amp;B music. The album was ranked number 90 on Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬Å 's 100 greatest albums of the 1990s. It was also listed as one of 33 hip hop/R&amp;B albums in Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬Å 's &quot;Essential Recordings of the '90s&quot;.[2]  One in a Million debuted at twenty on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 40,500 copies in its opening week; twenty-two weeks later the album peaked at eighteen, being certified Gold by RIAA. Within a few months, the album proved Aaliyah's breakthrough and a major milestone in the careers of Missy Elliott and Timbaland. It was certified double Platinum on June 16, 1997.[3] The album was also certified Gold by the Canadian recording industry for shipments of 50,000 copies. One in a Million has sold over two million copies in the United States and 10 million copies worldwide.[4]  The album produced six singles, &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;, &quot;4 Page Letter&quot;, &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot;, and &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot;, with the last becoming the album's highest-charting single, peaking at nine on the US Billboard Hot 100. In 2004, the album was re-released in Germany with altered artwork, and again in 2006.
