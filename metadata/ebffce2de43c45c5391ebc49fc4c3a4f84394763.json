Recorded on February 6, 1996 and released nearly three years later, it was the first concert by the pair to be available commercially. Live at Luther College was the only released concert by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, until the release of Live at Radio City in 2007. Live at Luther College features several unreleased and rare tracks, including &quot;What Will Become of Me?&quot;, which was played at the end of the song &quot;Jimi Thing&quot;. The show incorporates six songs that would appear on the studio album Crash when it was released later in 1996..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] One Sweet World\n[02] #41\n[03] Tripping Billies\n[04] Jimi Thing\n[05] Satellite\n[06] Crash Into Me\n[07] Deed Is Done\n[08] Lover Lay Down\n[09] What Would You Say\n[10] Minarets\n[11] Cry Freedom\n[12] Dancing Nancies\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:11m:00s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Typical Situation\n[02] Stream\n[03] Warehouse\n[04] Christmas Song\n[05] Seek Up\n[06] Say Goodbye\n[07] Ants Marching\n[08] Little Thing\n[09] Halloween\n[10] Granny\n[11] Two Step\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:05m:14s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:16m:14s\nTotal File Size....................... 316mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
