This proved to be overwhelmingly popular. The tickets were all allocated by 13:30 that same day.\r\n \r\nSonically blending elements of heavy metal, punk and hip-hop with social consciousness, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE earned acclaim as the thinking man's rock band. With de la Rocha's vicious lyrical delivery and guitarist Tom Morello's guitar innovations (at times &quot;scratching&quot; riffs akin to a DJ) backed by heavy bombastic rhythms, RAGE delivered scathing commentary about corporate America, government oppression, and other problems of the world at large, amassing a rabid fan following in the process.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2015\r\n\r\nStyle:\tAlternative\r\n\r\nCountry: USA\r\n\r\nFiles:\t12\r\n\r\nFormat:\t256k mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t116.99 MB\r\n\r\nLength : 01:03:51\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Live At Finsbury Park&quot; track listing:\r\n\r\n01.
