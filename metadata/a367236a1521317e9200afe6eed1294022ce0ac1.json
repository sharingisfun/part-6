Welcome to Low Town. \n\nIn the forgotten back alleys and flophouses that lie in the shadows of Rigus, the finest city of the Thirteen Lands, you will find Low Town. It is an ugly place, and its chamÃ‚Â­pion is an ugly man. Disgraced intelligence agent. Forgotten war hero. Independent drug dealer. After a fall from grace five years ago, a man known as the Warden leads a life of crime, addicted to cheap violence and expensive drugs. Every day is a constant hustle to find new customers and protect his turf from low-life competition like Tancred the Harelip and Ling Chi, the enigmatic crime lord of the heathens. \n\nThe WardenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life of drugged iniquity is shaken by his disÃ‚Â­covery of a murdered child down a dead-end street . . . setÃ‚Â­ting him on a collision course with the life he left behind. As a former agent with Black HouseÃ¢â‚¬â€the secret policeÃ¢â‚¬â€he knows better than anyone that murder in Low Town is an everyday thing, the kind of crime that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get investiÃ‚Â­gated. To protect his home, he will take part in a dangerous game of deception between underworld bosses and the psyÃ‚Â­chotic head of Black House, but the truth is far darker than he imagines. In Low Town, no one can be trusted. \n\nDaniel Polansky has crafted a thrilling novel steeped in noir sensibilities and relentless action, and set in an original world of stunning imagination, leading to a gut-wrenching, unforeseeable conclusion. Low Town is an attention-grabbing debut that will leave readers riveted . . . and hunÃ‚Â­gry for more.\n \n\nTomorrow The Killing\nOnce he was a hero of the Great War, and then a member of the dreaded Black House. Now he is the criminal linchpin of Low Town. \n\nHis name is Warden. He thought he had left the war behind him, but a summons from up above brings the past sharply, uncomfortably, back into focus.\n\nGeneral Montgomery's daughter is missing somewhere in Low Town, searching for clues about her brother's murder. The General wants her found, before the stinking streets can lay claim to her, too. Dark, violent, and shot through with corruption, Tomorrow the Killing is a fantastic successor to one of the most heralded fantasy debuts of recent times.\n\n\nShe Who Waits\nLow Town: the worst ghetto in the worst city in the Thirteen Lands. \n\nGood only for depravity and death. And Warden, long ago a respected agent in the formidable Black House, is now the most depraved Low Town denizen of them all.\n\nAs a younger man, Warden carried out more than his fair share of terrible deeds, and never as many as when he worked for the Black House. But WardenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing older, and the vultures are circling. Low Town is changing, faster than even he can control, and Warden knows that if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get out soon, he may never get out at all.\n\nBut Warden must finally reckon with his terrible past if he can ever hope to escape it. A hospital full of lunatics, a conspiracy against the corrupt new king and a ghetto full of thieves and murderers stand between him and his slim hope for the future. And behind them all waits the one person whose betrayal Warden never expected. The one person who left him, broken and bitter, to become the man he is today. \n\nThe one woman he ever loved.\n\nShe who waits behind all things.\n \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a367236a1521317e9200afe6eed1294022ce0ac1","amp;dn":"Daniel+Polansky+-+Low+Town+1-3+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a367236a1521317e9200afe6eed1294022ce0ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,103,35,106,21,33,49,126,146,0,175,230,238,209,41,64,34,206,10,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
