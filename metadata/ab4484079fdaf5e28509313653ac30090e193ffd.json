The main part of the book systematically surveys the most important disease areas for current drug development, from cardiovascular to endocrine disorders, and from infectious to neurological diseases. For each area, the availability of animal models for target validation, hit finding and lead profiling is reviewed, backed by numerous examples of both successes and failures among the use of animal models. The whole is rounded off with a discussion of perspectives and challenges.\nKey knowledge for drug researchers in industry as well as academia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4484079fdaf5e28509313653ac30090e193ffd","amp;dn":"In+vivo+Models+for+Drug+Discovery%2C+Vol+62+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4484079fdaf5e28509313653ac30090e193ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,68,132,7,159,218,245,226,133,9,49,54,83,172,48,9,14,25,63,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
