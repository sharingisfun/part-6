If there is any kind of history more direct and more powerful than honest recollection, then it is difficult to tell when you read a book like this. Terkel engages in no analysis, no pontificating, no attempt to reconcile morality with history. Instead, we hear people, all kinds of people, talking about what they remember, how it affected them then, and how it affects them now. Terkel has put together a remarkably fascinating cross-section of voices.&quot;\nThe Detroit Free Press\n\n&quot;Studs Terkel is more than a writer; he is a national resource. Many write about presidents; Studs gets to the deeper heart of our history and our national life.&quot;\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2168ab85b724ef6fde8bd7937e31c99e6b0c49","amp;dn":"Studs+Terkel+-+1984+-+The+Good+War+-+An+Oral+History+Of+World+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2168ab85b724ef6fde8bd7937e31c99e6b0c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,33,104,171,133,183,36,239,111,222,139,215,147,126,49,201,158,107,12,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
