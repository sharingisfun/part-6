With the help of his editor (Hume Cronyn), Frady goes underground to infiltrate the Parallax Corporation, which uses mind control to train assassins. And Frady might be the next one in line to take a fall. An excellent, post-watergate, paranoid thriller and a benchmark for films of this type from the 1970s.\n\n  Starring: Warren Beatty, Hume Cronyn, William Daniels, Kenneth Mars, Walter McGinn.\n\n  Directed by: Alan J.
