Spear has a very spiritual vibe in all of his releases that is undeniable when you listen. He feels it and you can feel it too when you listen. \n\nSeeing the man in person is like taking the ride on a higher level. I always want so badly to compare Spear and Bob Marley, but it is either impossible or unfair...I can't put my finger on it except to say Marley is a point of reference who everyone knows about. I tend to place Spear as an equal level as or even a level above Marley at times. He is all that Bob was spiritually. He is all that Bob was entertainment and charismatic-wise. So why isn't Spear as well know in the mainstream? I don't know. Maybe because he tends to sing the praises of Marcus Garvey (Jamaican Prophet) and this is just something that is not considered hip by the One Love crowd who hang out at Starbucks...I simply don't know. All I know is that Spear is on top of the game when it comes to quality roots reggae. Please give him a listen and hear for yourselves. You will be pleasantly suprised...oh and you're welcome in advance! One Love\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBurning Spear - Rasta Business\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Burning Spear\nAlbum................: Rasta Business\nGenre................: Reggae\nSource...............: CD\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nYear.................: 1995\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
