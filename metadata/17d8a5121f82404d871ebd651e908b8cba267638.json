The DDP Creator lets you assemble professional RedBook compatible audio CD's and supports the import and export of DDP 2.00 images and Cue Sheet (cue) files. It also enables you to burn and rip audio CD's and send off images with FTP.\n\nCD authoring\nWith the DDP Creator you can assemble a RedBook compatible CD by just dropping wav or aif files on the workspace and set the track order. After that you can adjust the spaces between tracks and audition this by playing back the transition from one track into another. Then edit the PQ points, ISRC, MCN and CD-Text data. Finally export to DDP, Cue Sheet or CD and print a PQ sheet if needed.\n\nDDP export\nThe main feature of the DDP Creator is the export of the CD project to a DDP 2.00 fileset. The industry standard DDP protocol is supported by all major CD replication plants and ensures an error free transfer and manufacturing of your masters. No more need to burn a physical master CD any more!\n\nDDP import (loadback)\nBesides DDP export the DDP Creator can import (loadback) a DDP fileset too, including DDP images made by other software, like Bias Peak Studio (XT), Sonic Studio HD, SADiE, Sequoia or Pyramix. This feature allows you to check the project including all PQ codes, ISRC, MCN and CD-Text data. You can edit the project, playback tracks and export to DDP, Cue Sheet or burn a Redbook compatible CD from it.\n\nEnhanced CD\nThe Pro option allows even more control and adds Enhanced CD support to the DDP Creator. You can create Enhanced CD DDP filesets from within the program by adding an ISO file to an audio project. This can be an (Hybrid) ISO file made with for example Toast or an ISO file made with the DDP Creator by converting a folder holding the data files. \n\nSystem requirements Windows:\n\n   Windows 2000 or higher\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
