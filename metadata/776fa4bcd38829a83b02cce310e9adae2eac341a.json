The Kingdoms are at peace for now, but challenges face Kieri Phelan, the new half-Elven king of Lyonya; his newlywed half-Elven queen, Arian; and Mikeli Mahieran, the young king of Tsaia. The Queen of the Elves, KieriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother, has been murdered. Forbidden magic is suddenly appearing everywhere, and antimagic activists are executing those who display itÃ¢â‚¬â€including children. Meanwhile, ex-thief Arvid Semminson, trying to make an honest life with his son, is hearing the commanding voice of the god Gird in his head, a dubious honor Arvid dreads. Moon deftly avoids big literary explosions, preferring instead a slow boil that builds pressure without relief. There are plots within plots, but the complex story is never confusing. Fantasy fans will be delighted by this impressive foray.&quot; - Publishers Weekly\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776fa4bcd38829a83b02cce310e9adae2eac341a","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+Moon+-+Paladin%27s+Legacy+-+Book+4+-+Limits+of+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776fa4bcd38829a83b02cce310e9adae2eac341a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,111,164,188,211,136,41,168,59,2,204,227,16,233,173,174,46,172,52,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
