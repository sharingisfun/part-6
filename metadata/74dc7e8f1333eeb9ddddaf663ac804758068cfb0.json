It is not intended to supply an illustrated catalogue of all the notable pen draughtsmen of Europe and America. Some well-known names will be missed, and missed with regret ; but the Editor has endeavoured, within the limits of the space at his disposal, to render each section of the book as representative as possible of the best work of the nationalities dealt with.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74dc7e8f1333eeb9ddddaf663ac804758068cfb0","amp;dn":"Modern+pen+drawings+-+European+and+American+%281901+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74dc7e8f1333eeb9ddddaf663ac804758068cfb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,220,126,143,19,51,238,185,221,221,175,102,58,200,4,117,128,104,207,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
