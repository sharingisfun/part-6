Her lyrics are the stuff of heartbreak and uncertainty -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI wish I knew what to do with youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ she laments during the first track, and later refers to herself as a loverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconsolation prizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- but her performances are confident, both simple in their delivery and subtle in their emotional punch. Because I Was in Love isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a bare-boned folk album; rather, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the sort of record that unfolds its layers with repeated listens, and the arrangements are often gorgeously lush without threatening to overpower Van EttenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alto.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/2091/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1130c5af7de039f9d4a132b9055b985ce4da7459","amp;dn":"Sharon+Van+Etten+-+Because+I+Was+In+Love+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1130c5af7de039f9d4a132b9055b985ce4da7459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,48,197,175,125,224,57,249,212,161,50,185,5,91,152,92,228,218,116,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
