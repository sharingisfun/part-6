At first, naive locals approach the cylinder armed just with a white flag - only to be quickly killed by an all-destroying heat-ray, as terrifying tentacled invaders emerge. Soon the whole of human civilisation is under threat, as powerful Martians build gigantic killing machines, destroy all in their path with black gas and burning rays, and feast on the warm blood of trapped, still-living human prey. The forces of the earth, however, may prove harder to beat than they at first appear....\n\n* Sean Barrett is one of my favourite narrators and his reading of this classic novel is simply superb!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3805d4c1b068785a40afb641e5dd10516de995da","amp;dn":"The+War+of+the+Worlds+-+H.G.Wells+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3805d4c1b068785a40afb641e5dd10516de995da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,5,212,193,176,104,120,90,64,175,182,65,229,221,16,81,109,233,149,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
