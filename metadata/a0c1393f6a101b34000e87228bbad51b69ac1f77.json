By convenient I mean that you can transfer &amp; listen to them on your \npersonal mp3 player or burn them onto a cd-r &amp; listen to them on your stereo or CD Walkman.\n\nPlease read the descriptions for each track as some of them are quite effective &amp; can\n(if used correctly) have a very strong effect.\n\nFor best results, play through headphones in private laying comfortably with eyes closed.\n\nBrainwave synchronization (entrainment) may be achieved when audio signals are introduced \nto the brain causing a response directly related to the frequency of the signal introduced, \ncalled binaural beats. Two tones close in frequency generate a beat frequency at the \ndifference of the frequencies, which is generally subsonic. For example, a 500 Hz tone and \n510 Hz tone will produce a subsonic 10 Hz tone, roughly in the middle of the alpha range. \nThe resulting subsonic tone may affect the state of mind of the subject. The &quot;carrier \nfrequency&quot; (i.e. the 500 Hz in the example above), is also said by some to affect the \nquality of the transformative experience.\n\nEach audio track contains advanced binaural beats that will synchronize your brainwaves \nto the same state as the recreational dose. Mixed with our advanced auditory pulses are \nsoothing backtracks of ambient soundscapes to help the brain induce of state of mood lift, \neuphoria, sedation, and hallucination.\n\nY'all know what happens when you don't seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c1393f6a101b34000e87228bbad51b69ac1f77","amp;dn":"%5Bkaaskip%5D+I-Doser+%28Binaural+Beat%29+MP3%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c1393f6a101b34000e87228bbad51b69ac1f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,193,57,63,106,16,27,52,0,14,135,34,139,186,213,27,105,172,31,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
