It comes integrated with its own mocking framework based on Jmock. This book introduces you to RSpec helping you to write idiomatic specifications for Ruby code in a test first approach.\n\nInstant RSpec Test-Driven Development How-to is filled with examples of actual code accompanied by explanations and covers general Ruby, Rails, and RSpec use cases plus a few of the more advanced topics. RSpec Test Driven Development is written on the premise that you will need no experience with RSpec and limited experience with Ruby, Rails, and TDD fundamentals. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll begin by writing a very simple Ruby library in true TDD fashion and and use the red, green, refactor tools to migrate this library into a Rails application.\n\nInstant RSpec Test-Driven Development How-to will teach you the actual steps performed in writing an idiomatic specification. You will be able to write a test for the code you wish you had, and learn to write only the minimum code necessary to pass a test, and write more specifications to drive out the production functionality your application will need. Through the course of the book, you will convert a Ruby program into a new Rails application, test Rails specifics such as file uploads, cookies, and model validation and even learn how to use Capybara. RSpec Test Driven Development will help you build confidence in the code they you write and spend less time dealing with bugs and maintenance headaches.\n\nApproach\n\nFilled with practical, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for the most important and useful tasks. A concise guide that delivers immediate results with practical recipes on learning practical hints.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is aimed at Ruby developers with beginner level expertise who want to use RSpec and test driven development methodology to improve the code they write. Experienced programmers new to Ruby will also benefit from this book which also covers creating testable, idiomatic Ruby code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178ad41ac1ab86284e36dc88244ebc7bddb507fa","amp;dn":"Instant+RSpec+Test+Driven+Development+How-to+%5BPDF%5D%7EStorm%7D%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178ad41ac1ab86284e36dc88244ebc7bddb507fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,138,212,26,193,171,134,40,78,54,220,136,36,78,188,123,221,181,7,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
