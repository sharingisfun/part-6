Around 1976 he developed an innovative new compositional technique called &quot;tintinnabuli&quot; (Latin for &quot;sounding bells&quot;), which has had an extraordinary degree of success. It is frequently performed around the world, has been used in award-winning films, and pieces such as FÃƒÂ¼r Alina and Spiegel im Siegel have become standard repertoire.\n\nThis collection of essays, written by a distinguished international group of scholars and performers, is the essential guide to Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt and his music. The book begins with a general introduction to PÃƒÂ¤rt's life and works, covering important biographical details and outlining his most significant compositions. Two chapters analyze the tintinnabuli style and are complemented by essays which discuss PÃƒÂ¤rt's creative process. The book also examines the spiritual aspect of PÃƒÂ¤rt's music and contextualizes him in the cultural milieu of the twenty-first century and in the marketplace.\n\n- Covers a wide range of subjects and approaches to PÃƒÂ¤rt and his music: biographical, analytical, contextual, cultural and historical, providing a complete and authoritative guide to the composer\n\n- Technical musical language and any theoretical concepts are clearly explained and contextualized\n\n- Includes original writing and quotations from Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt which appear in English for the first time, enabling readers to engage directly with the composer and to form their own opinion of what he says\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;This volume is long overdue. Although the music of Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt has been readily embraced by audiences, listeners and licensees (providing the soundtrack to many Hollywood films and YouTube clips), the Estonian-born composer has yet to enter the academic press. Joining an august catalog of previous composers and genre companions from [Cambridge], Andrew Shenton's volume is a persuasive act of stimulation and provocation.&quot; -- Classical Music\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147f8a6e3b8e8295bcfefc124b62f4fdec638525","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Companion+to+Arvo+Part+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147f8a6e3b8e8295bcfefc124b62f4fdec638525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,127,138,110,59,142,130,149,188,254,252,18,75,98,244,253,236,99,133,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
