Living Off The Grid, So to speak.\n\nThe people in this book have made this a reality. This also questions the role of \n\nour government in the taxation area in particular. \n\nQ: If you're living off the land and have no income, how can they tax you. \n\nA: They could(but won't) put you in a forced labor camp(like the one's in   \n   Stalin's era) and make you work and then tax your income for the rest of your \n   life. But that would mean reverting to communism(what a paradox!).\n\n\n   \n            O man, naked you were born, naked you will return to it.\n\n                  \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2068119a4bb16fb2ba5a7805612b309d3b37ce","amp;dn":"Living+Without+Money.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2068119a4bb16fb2ba5a7805612b309d3b37ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,32,104,17,154,75,177,111,178,186,90,120,5,97,43,48,157,59,55,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
