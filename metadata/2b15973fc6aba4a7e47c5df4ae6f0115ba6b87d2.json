The author, a highly successful fantasy artist, teaches the basics of human anatomical drawing and musculature, as well as perspective and composition. He then instructs on ways to distort, develop, and transform the human figure, giving it features that range from monstrous or magical to super-agile or larger than life. Detailed artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s references and step-by-step instructions show how to build bodies that truly stretch the imaginationÃ¢â‚¬â€mighty alien warriors, kick-boxing cyber-punks, and mega-muscled superheroes, to name just a few. Art students also learn how to show their characters in many different dynamic action poses, such as flying, spinning, punching, and jumping, as well as how to express each characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotions through facial expressions. More than 300 color illustrations.
