At the heart of the valley lies a remarkable farmhouse, a building that is being run just as it was in the year 1620. Without electricity, refrigeration, mains water, tractors or chemical pesticides, our group will live off the land, eating the period food they grow and wearing the period clothing they can create. We watch and share the drama and frustration as they cope with a plethora of natural challenges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with 400 year-old manuals as their source of knowledge. Each programme focuses on the a month in the life of the farm, following the seasonal tasks our team endeavour to carry out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from harvesting and building, to the birthing of calves and pigs, from salting and smoking meat to sheep shearing and garment making. The series is genuinely revealing about life in times gone byÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nPart 7: March\nThey are halfway through the project, with March being their seventh month on the farm. They get busy turning wheat into bread flour, threshing it energetically with some period flails and then winnowing it - throwing it up in the air to separate the grain from the chaff - using a replica basket. Then it's off to a water mill to take the labour out of the 'daily grind'. They have a go at making some March beer, play some period games, and yoke up some piglets to root up a field for spring sowing. It's also time to overhaul the vegetable garden, and try out some contemporary dishes for Lent - salt cod and egg and pear pies.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1541 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 30mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 350 MB\nSource: DVD\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633140164ef59a900b1d985c358fe4a35661b45d","amp;dn":"BBC.Tales.From.The.Green.Valley.07of12.March.x264.AC3..mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633140164ef59a900b1d985c358fe4a35661b45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,49,64,22,78,245,154,144,11,29,152,92,53,143,228,163,86,97,180,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
