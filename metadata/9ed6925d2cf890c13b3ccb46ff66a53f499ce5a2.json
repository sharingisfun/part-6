It was the first time they had been together since 1973. They recorded a brand new studio album, Perfect Strangers and headed out on tour. This show was filmed in Melbourne, Australia and is the only full length concert film of the band at this time. It s a stunning concert with the band in incendiary form. The setlist mixes then new tracks from the Perfect Strangers album with favourites from the early seventies culminating in the brilliant Smoke On The Water finale. This is without doubt one of the finest Deep Purple concerts ever filmed and a must have for their legions of fans.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Highway Star\n02. NobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home\n03.
