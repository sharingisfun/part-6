We'll start with a 3D base, which we will use to as a starting reference for anatomy and pose. Using simple line drawing, we will then layout the basic bits and pieces of our armor. The next step is to photo texture the armor using reference images from real armors. To finish everything up we will have a look at different blending and lighting techniques that will help you polish and finalize any digital illustration. \n\nAfter viewing this training you should have a solid grasp on using photo textures, painting different types of lighting and reflection and finishing a drawing that looks clean, crisp and ready for your portfolio.
