Keith released his first four studio albums - 1993's Toby Keith, 1994's Boomtown, 1996's Blue Moon and 1997's Dream Walkin', plus a Greatest Hits package for various divisions of Mercury Records before exiting in 1998. These albums all earned gold or higher certification, and produced several chart singles, including his debut 'Should've Been a Cowboy', which topped the country charts and was the most played country song of the 1990s. The song has received three million spins since then, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated.\n\nSigned to Nashville DreamWorks in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single 'How Do You Like Me Now?!' that year. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the Number One country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more Number Ones each, and all of the albums were certified multi-platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.\n\nWhen Dreamworks closed in 2005, Keith founded his own label, Show Dog Nashville, which became part of Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009. He has released five studio albums on this label: 2006's White Trash with Money, 2007's Big Dog Daddy, 2008's That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy, 2009's American Ride and 2010's Bullets in the Gun as well as the compilation 35 Biggest Hits. He has also signed several other acts to the label, including Trailer Choir, Carter's Chord, Flynnville Train, Trace Adkins, Mac McAnally and Mica Roberts. Keith also made his acting debut in 2005, starring in the film Broken Bridges and co-starred with comedian Rodney Carrington in the 2008 film Beer for My Horses.\n\nKeith has released thirteen studio albums, two Christmas albums, and multiple compilation albums. He has also charted more than forty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including nineteen Number One hits and sixteen additional Top Ten hits. His longest-lasting Number One hits are 'Beer for My Horses' (a 2003 duet with Willie Nelson) and 'As Good as I Once Was' (2005), at six weeks each.\n\n- - -\n\nClancy's Tavern is the title of the 16th studio album by American country music artist Toby Keith. It was released on October 25, 2011 via Show Dog-Universal Music. Lead-off single 'Made in America' was released on June 13, 2011, reaching number one on the country charts in October 2011. Clancy's Tavern draws its name from the title track, which Keith wrote about his grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bar in Fort Smith, Arkansas. A deluxe edition of the album includes four cover songs recorded live at a small venue in New York City. (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nToby Keith - Clancy's Tavern 2011\n(Show Dog-Universal Music)\n\n 1.
