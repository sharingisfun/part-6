Inside these walls, humanity lived in peace for one hundred years, but in the beginning of the story, a sudden attack by a gigantic sixty-meter Titan and a smaller Titan covered in armor plates causes the outermost wall to be breached, forcing mankind to abandon the land between Wall Maria and Wall RosÃƒÂ©, which leads to famine and turmoil.\n\nThe series follows the story of Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert. After the outermost wall falls and his mother dies in the resulting destruction, Eren vows revenge against the Titans and later enlists in the military, accompanied by Mikasa and Armin. \n \t \nEpisodes:\nEpisode #1: To You, in 2000 Years: The Fall of Zhiganshina I\nEpisode #2: That Day: The Fall of Zhiganshina II\nEpisode #3: A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair: Humanity Rises Again I\nEpisode #4: Night of the Disbanding: Humanity Rises Again II\nEpisode #5: First Battle: The Battle for Trost I\nEpisode #6: The World the Girl Saw: The Battle for Trost II\nEpisode #7: A Small Blade: The Battle for Trost III\nEpisode #8: A Heartbeat Can Be Heard: The Battle for Trost IV\nEpisode #9: Where the Left Arm Went: The Battle for Trost V\nEpisode #10: Response: The Battle for Trost VI\nEpisode #11: Icon: The Battle for Trost VII\nEpisode #12: Wound: The Battle for Trost VIII\nEpisode #13: Primal Desires: The Battle for Trost IX\n\n\nWatch streaming episodes of Attack on Titan and much more at AnimeFTW.tv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284fa00ef091249e57647a03bc8fef6cfd7a7188","amp;dn":"Attack+On+Titan+-+Season+One+-+English+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284fa00ef091249e57647a03bc8fef6cfd7a7188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,79,160,14,240,145,36,158,87,100,122,3,188,143,239,108,253,122,113,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
