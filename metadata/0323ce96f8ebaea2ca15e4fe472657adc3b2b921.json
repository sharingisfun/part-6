It contains 4 tracks (5 songs) from Above, recorded live at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, WA.  That&amp;#039;s the same show where the VHS was recorded.  Yes, VHS.  These are NOT from the VHS, these are ripped from the CD that was NOT made available commercially.\n\nHope you enjoy... I&amp;#039;m DL&amp;#039;ing the VHS rip right now, since my VHS is toast.\n\nI love(d) these guys and they&amp;#039;re a massive part of my musical experience.\n\nEnjoy,\nmufuka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0323ce96f8ebaea2ca15e4fe472657adc3b2b921","amp;dn":"Mad+Season+-+Above+%2B+Live+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0323ce96f8ebaea2ca15e4fe472657adc3b2b921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,35,206,150,248,235,174,162,202,21,228,254,71,38,87,173,195,178,185,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
