It was released in 1979 on Charisma Records.\nThe album is loosely based on the book Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes.\nThe instrumental piece &quot;From the Undertow&quot; was used in the 1978 British movie The Shout, for which Banks, with Mike Rutherford, composed the incidental music. No soundtrack of the movie is available. The piece was originally intended to be the intro to &quot;Undertow&quot; from the Genesis album ...And Then There Were Three... (hence the title), but it was omitted from the song.\nThe cover design is by Hothouse, and the cover painting is Wuluwait - Boatman of the Dead by Australian artist Ainslie Roberts.\nThe album was recorded at ABBA's Polar Music Studios during a brief Genesis hiatus.\nMusicians:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Kim Beacon: Vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Chester Thompson: Drums and percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tony Banks: Keyboards, guitars, basses &amp; percussion\n\n1983-The Wicked Lady (Soundtrack) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 192 kbps\nSide 1 performed by Tony Banks:\n01.

In 2001, the Genesis Official Home said a CD reissue of The Wicked Lady is planned but nothing has been heard since.

Tony Banks wanted the album releaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as the title suggestedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with no reference to the band members; but the record company went against his wishes.\nIt was released September 11th, 1995 in the UK. The album has never been released in the USA. The album is called Strictly Inc instead of Strictly Incognito because there is already a band in the UK named Incognito.)\nThere were three extra tracks that did not make it onto the album: two instrumentals and one song with vocals whose lyrics were written by Nik Kershaw. The album features a 17 minute opus called 'An Island in the Darkness' considered to be among Tony's best solo pieces.\nMusicians:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jack Hues : Vocals &amp; Guitars\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tony Banks : Keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ John Robinson : Drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Daryl Stuermer : Guitars\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Nathan East : Bass\n\n2002-Seven: A Suite for Orchestra ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 320 kbps\n????????:\n01.
