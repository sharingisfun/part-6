His ambition puts him at odds with local chieftain Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), who insists on sending his raiders to the impoverished east rather than the uncharted west. When Ragnar teams up with his boat builder friend Floki (Gustaf Skarsgard) to craft a new generation of intrepid ships capable of conquering the rough northern seas, the stage is set for conflict. But for all its warfare and bloodshed, Vikings is also a story of family and brotherhood, capturing the love and affection between Ragnar and his wife, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), a respected warrior in her own right. It is the tale of RagnarÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s brother Rollo (Clive Standen), a fierce fighter who simmers with jealously; of Earl HaraldsonÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s wife Siggy (Jessalyn Gilsig), a dutiful beauty who may be less than loyal; and of the monk Athelstan (George Blagden), whose Christian morals clash with the VikingsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ pagan society. As ambition and innovation rattle a civilization, these characters will be put to the testÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶and their way of life will never be the same again.\n\n\nPart. 1 Rites of Passage\nIn 8th century Scandinavia, Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a warrior and a farmer who dreams of finding riches by bucking the tradition of raiding to the east. Ragnar has been working in secret on a project that will turn the Viking world on its head. But first Ragnar must convince the leader of his community, the powerful Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), who is none too happy to share in the renown that this journey could bring to Ragnar if it's successful.\n\n\nPart. 2 Wrath of the Northmen\nThe stage is set for the first journey west by Ragnar Lothbrok as he gathers a crew willing to risk their lives to travel into the unknown. Earl Haraldson's paranoia reaches new heights as it becomes apparent that trust is hard to come by in this dark era.\n\n\nPart. 3 Dispossessed\nA monastery in Lindesfarne is about to get a firsthand look at how the Vikings operate. In and out in a flurry of violence and terror, Ragnar and his crew raid the monastery for everything it contains, from treasure to monks who can be sold as slaves. Unable to ignore the riches this unsanctioned journey has returned, Earl Haraldson has no choice but to agree to let these warriors undertake a second trip out. The West has now been opened for the taking by Ragnar Lothbrok, and the world of the Vikings will never be the same.\n\n\nPart. 4 Trial\nThe Vikings head back to England to see what other treasures this new world has to offer. Ragnar and his crew sail out with Earl Haraldson's permissionÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª.and also with Earl Haraldson's spy. After bloodshed on the beach, the Vikings choose the Sabbath to invade the town of Hexam and unleash a flood of violence and panic. In the midst of the terror, Ragnar and Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick) discover that there are consequences for every action and Earl Haraldson is always watching.\n\n\nPart. 5 Raid\nIn the Great Hall of Kattegat, a seer reads Earl Haraldson's future and tells him that Ragnar Lothbrok searches for his death. The unanswerable question is whom the gods favor more? As a man willing to defend his power and status to the death, Haraldson intends to take precautionary measures. Ragnar, his home and farm burned by the Earl, is hurt but hidden safely away. He must now choose the path that will lead him back to his freedom.\n\n\nPart. 6 Burial of the Dead\nRagnar, weak and still hurt, must meet the Earl head-on after it comes to light that Rollo has been tortured on Haraldson's orders. The two men will come together face to face with a single outcome possible: Only one man will leave this fight alive.\n\n\nPart. 7 A King's Ransom\nThree Viking ships sail upriver towards the very heart of power in eastern England: the Royal Villa of King Aelle. Ragnar Lothbrok has come looking for ransom in exchange for peace. However, King Aelle has a different plan in mind for these northern heathens.\n\n\nPart 8 Sacrifice\nThe traditional pilgrimage to Uppsalla to thank the gods brings a torrent of emotions for Ragnar, Lagertha, and Athelstan. Ragnar, pulling farther away from his wife, goes to make peace with the death of his unborn son. Lagertha, still reeling from her miscarriage, wants to find out from the gods if more sons are in her future. As the Vikings come together to sacrifice and give thanks to their gods, Athelstan discovers just how strong his Christian faith still is.\n\n\nPart. 9 All Change\nAt the behest of King Horik, Ragnar assembles a small party to travel to Gotaland (modern day Sweden) to resolve a land dispute with the area's leader, Jarl Borg. Ragnar's renown precedes him and Jarl Borg is intriguedÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´has he found a new ally or is Ragnar just a puppet of the king? Meanwhile in Kattegat, with a plague taking its toll on the village, the people look to Lagertha to help appease the gods.\n\n\nTechnical Specs \n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3e765759567e720a100f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16.9\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 45mins \nFramerate: 29 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 9\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: average 998 MB\nSource: Blu-ray DVD\nEncoded by: ArtistHarry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/vikings/pictures&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/vikings/pictures&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:434a928be7fee0b3ed8b2061b4b2b8f59e30a889","amp;dn":"The.Vikings.Series.1.2013.4of9.Trial.720p.BDRip.x264.AAC.ArtistH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"434a928be7fee0b3ed8b2061b4b2b8f59e30a889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,74,146,139,231,254,224,179,237,139,32,97,180,178,184,245,158,48,168,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
