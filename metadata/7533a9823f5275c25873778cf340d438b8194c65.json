The &quot;Science Fiction&quot; of the past has now simply become &quot;Science&quot;. And the science of the future was strangely prophesied by a group of visionaries whose dreams once may have deemed them renegades and &quot;mad scientists,&quot; have become reality! In 1950, the term &quot;Robotics&quot; was coined by author Isaac Asimov in his book I.ROBOT - and our collective imagination reeled. In the years since, literature, movies and television have allowed us to embrace the notion that the ideas of a few inspired visionaries could be made real. What is more astonishing is that these ideas have been, are currently and will be put to practice in our everyday lives. Each episode of the upcoming series prophets of science fiction will focus on how the great minds of Science Fiction imagined our future for us, and how some, in turn, made their fantasies real. In a dynamic hyper-stylized way that has never been seen before ... we will take a tour of what was, and what will be through the eyes of the visionary authors, illustrators, filmmakers, and scientists who have become the prophets of science fiction!\n\n\n\n\n4)  Arthur C Clarke \nSome sci-fi storytellers are content to merely predict, but Sir Arthur C. Clarke creates. The writer is single-handedly responsible for the cornerstone of modern telecommunication technology: the satellite. Clarke's collaboration with director Stanley Kubrick on the iconic 2001 predicted videophones, iPads, and commercial spaceflight, while redefining science-fiction cinema for a new generation.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img16/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img16/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img834/5253/prophetsofsciencefictiom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img834/5253/prophetsofsciencefictiom.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img525/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img525/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img560/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img560/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img526/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img526/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img140/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img140/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img818/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img818/1640/prophetsofsciencefictio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/6844/prophetsofsciencefictioi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/6844/prophetsofsciencefictioi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bit-rate: 2138\n * Video Resolution: 720Ãƒâ€”400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0Ãƒâ€”2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * Run Time Per Part: 44.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_of_Science_Fiction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_of_Science_Fiction&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7533a9823f5275c25873778cf340d438b8194c65","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Prophets+of+Science+Fiction+4of8+Arthur+C+Clarke+Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7533a9823f5275c25873778cf340d438b8194c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,51,169,130,63,82,117,194,88,115,119,140,243,64,212,56,184,25,76,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
