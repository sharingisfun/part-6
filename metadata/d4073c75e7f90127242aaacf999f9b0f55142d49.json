By applying this process, you will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.\n\nEach chapter addresses one common complaint and begins with a case and guidance on how to organize the differential diagnosis. As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.\n\nThe third edition is enhanced by the addition of five new chapters--Bleeding Disorders, Dysuria, Hematuria, Hypotension, and Sore Throat--as well as a greater emphasis on how to master the process of working from patient level data (signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests). All chapters incorporate the latest research resulting in new and refined approaches to common symptoms encountered in clinical medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4073c75e7f90127242aaacf999f9b0f55142d49","amp;dn":"Symptom+to+Diagnosis+An+Evidence+Based+Guide+3E+%5BEpub%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4073c75e7f90127242aaacf999f9b0f55142d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,7,60,117,231,249,1,39,36,42,170,207,153,159,155,15,85,20,45,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
