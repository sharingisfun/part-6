An important book in this collection is the one titled: &quot;Sex, Priests, and Secret Codes; the Catholics Church's 2000-year Paper Trail of Sexual Abuse&quot;, by: Doyle, Sipe and Wall. \nIn this book the authors expose a documented history of sexual abuse of minors and adults by Catholic clergy that continued without interruption from the post-Apostolic era to the present.
