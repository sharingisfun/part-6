The friendship\nthat we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year ...\nand it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the\nppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and\nany kind of sceners. In the times of flaming and arrogance its a\nluck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We appreciate\nyour help and your support in any way. So if you wanna join our\nsmall and welfare community, dont hesitate\nto contact us.\n\nWe dont care for a monthly amount of rips\nits still all about the music and friendship.\n\nLast but not least a few greets fly\n\nto our friends from :\n\n1way AMOK BCC BFHMP3 BOSS CMC CMG DPS EMP FKK FuFFENS gEm HiT2000 iTS kiNKy\n\nkW mbs miso MPX MYCEL PsyCZ sb sour SSR TR UBE UKi\n\nTHE END !\n\n.K!ND.\n\n.Drum 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18608635cf76bf9c18929d499d4e4e0fccf16f27","amp;dn":"VA+-+Deep+House+Charts+2014-%282CD%29-2014-DRUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18608635cf76bf9c18929d499d4e4e0fccf16f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,96,134,53,207,118,191,156,24,146,157,73,157,78,78,15,204,241,111,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
