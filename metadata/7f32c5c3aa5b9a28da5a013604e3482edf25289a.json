MC RA Scion and DJ Sabzi have received rave reviews locally, landing in the Seattle Times' artists-to-watch list in 2006, appearing on the front cover of Sound Seattle magazine's September 2006 issue, and obtaining the personal endorsement of hip-hop pioneer KRS-One as an exceptional up-and-coming group. Sabzi, a classically trained pianist and member of Seattle rap group Blue Scholars, and RA Scion came to meet each other in 2004 because of their identical ambitions to make Seattle a hotbed for hip-hop and their similar beliefs as worshipers of the Baha'i Faith. After Sabzi lent production help to RA Scion's solo album, Live and Learn, the two formed Common Market in 2005. Their self-titled debut album was first released in 2005 but then released nationally in early 2006.\n\nIncluded albums:\n-Black Patch War\n-Common Market\n-The Winters End EP (only a couple tracks, but they're keepers!)\n-Tobacco Road\n\n\nENJOY!\n\n-live4rain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f32c5c3aa5b9a28da5a013604e3482edf25289a","amp;dn":"Common+Market","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f32c5c3aa5b9a28da5a013604e3482edf25289a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,50,197,195,170,91,154,40,218,90,1,54,4,227,72,46,223,37,40,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
