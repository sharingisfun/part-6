They&amp;#039;re the best of mates with a shared sense of humour that helps them survive in a landscape of comic losers and broken dreams. But their friendship is put to the test by a chancer encounter.\n\nAfter a stranger saves them from being beaten up, the boys are only too happy to help their new hero and pal in his quest to date Romeo&amp;#039;s sister. Little do they realise they are being drawn into a world of dangerous obsession, violence and desperation; a world that threatens to tear the two friends apart.\n\nFrom acclaimed director Shane Meadows &amp;#039;A Room for Romeo Brass&amp;#039; is a contemporary coming-of-age story that is as funny as it is frightening.&quot;\n\nA must see film basically. Oh and it was Paddy Considine&amp;#039;s (one of the Andy&amp;#039;s: Hot Fuzz) first acting role, and what a performance it is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a48d05682a788b3ea1851f06195266b2b691af5","amp;dn":"A+Room+for+Romeo+Brass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a48d05682a788b3ea1851f06195266b2b691af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,72,208,86,130,167,136,179,234,24,81,240,97,149,38,107,43,105,26,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
