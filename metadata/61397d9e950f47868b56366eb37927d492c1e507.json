Find out how the corporate media facilitates the partnership between the Fed and Congress and why it fails to disclose what's going on. Lastly, find out how the Federal Reserve Member Banks are owned and controlled by an elite group of insiders.\n\nThis Telly Award-winning documentary features presidential candidate RON PAUL (R-Texas) and is inspired by The Creature from Jekyll Isalnd a book by well-known author and FREEDOM FORCE founder, G. Edward Griffin.\n\nAlso featured is Dr. Edwin Vieira, Ph.D., J.D. from Harvard (a foremost authority on the Constitution and the author of Pieces of Eight) who discusses the Fed and various long-term studies which indicate that the Federal Reserve System encourages war, destabilizes the economy, generates inflation (a hidden tax) and is the supreme instrument of unjust enrichment for a select group of insiders. Dr. Theodore Baehr (founder of MOVIEGUIDEÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®) rounds out the show by discussing the relationship between the Media, the Fed and the Government and why you never see these issues discussed on network TV or in the mainstream media.\n\nAccordingly, the government-licensed networks and those living off the fiat money system are probably not going to distribute FIAT EMPIRE so the burden may fall upon word-of-mouth distribution from people like you -- responsible citizens that care. \n\nBear in mind that twice before in our nation's history, the People have voted down a central bank similar to the Federal Reserve System. We can do it again if we are able to explain to enough people why the national debt, currently over  $9,000,000,000,000 and the trade deficit -- currently over $425 billion this year alone -- are going to crash the fiat empire sooner or later.\n\nFIAT EMPIRE defines the problem and proposes a number of solutions to correct the situation and bring back a Constitutional monetary system to the United States.\n\n\n\nRun Time: 59 minutes\n\n\nFor more information or to purchase this video, please visit: http://www.fiatempire.com/screener/\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61397d9e950f47868b56366eb37927d492c1e507","amp;dn":"Fiat+Empire+%5BAVI+-+The+Federal+Reserve+Is+A+Fraud%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61397d9e950f47868b56366eb37927d492c1e507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,57,125,158,149,15,71,134,139,86,54,110,179,121,39,212,146,193,229,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
