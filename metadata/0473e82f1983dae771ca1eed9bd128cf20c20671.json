Judt presents the triumphs and the failures of prominent intellectuals, adeptly explaining both their ideas and the risks of their political commitments. Spanning an era with unprecedented clarity and insight, Thinking the Twentieth Century is a tour-de-force, a classic engagement of modern thought by one of the centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most incisive thinkers.\n\nThe exceptional nature of this work is evident in its very structure--a series of intimate conversations between Judt and his friend and fellow historian Timothy Snyder, grounded in the texts of the time and focused by the intensity of their vision. Judt's astounding eloquence and range are here on display as never before. Traversing the complexities of modern life with ease, he and Snyder revive both thoughts and thinkers, guiding us through the debates that made our world. As forgotten ideas are revisited and fashionable trends scrutinized, the shape of a century emerges. Judt and Snyder draw us deep into their analysis, making us feel that we too are part of the conversation. We become aware of the obligations of the present to the past, and the force of historical perspective and moral considerations in the critique and reform of society, then and now.\n\nIn restoring and indeed exemplifying the best of intellectual life in the twentieth century, Thinking the Twentieth Century opens pathways to a moral life for the twenty-first. This is a book about the past, but it is also an argument for the kind of future we should strive for: Thinking the Twentieth Century is about the life of the mind--and the mindful life.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nIn this scintillating series of conversations undertaken as he was dying of Lou GehrigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease, British-American historian Judt (The Memory Chalet) and his interlocutor Snyder (Bloodlands) survey the triumphs and barbarities of the past century through the lens of the thinkers and ideologues who shaped it. Interleaving autobiographical sketches with fluent, freewheeling discussions of history, politics, and culture, Judt revisits crucial 20th-century intellectual currents: the impact of two world wars and the Great Depression on politics and philosophy; the development of and rivalry between communist and fascist dogmas; the success of social democracy and Keynesian economics in bringing liberal government, broad-based growth, and social equality to the post-war world; and the retreat from those achievements prompted by free-market fundamentalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack on the activist state. (He also reprises his criticism of Israel after recalling summers on the kibbutz.) JudtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to distill heaps of erudition into lucid, pithy conversation, even when on a breathing apparatus, is astonishing; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as engaging on the religious dimensions of Marxism and Freudianism as on Obama and the Iraq War. Snyder, a historian and former student of JudtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, contributes probing interjections that stimulate and test his mentorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas. The result is a lively, browsable, deeply satisfying meditation on recent history by a deservedly celebrated public intellectual. (Feb.)\n\nTHE LOS ANGELES TIMES\n&quot;There are so many ways that Thinking the Twentieth Century is a remarkable book. The lifetime of scholarship and intellectual engagement lying behind that verb &quot;thinking&quot; in the title. The way ideas crackle in the interplay between the authors. The passionate involvement with issues political and controversial. That the book could have been written at all, given the tragic circumstances surrounding it... Judt proceeds to take the reader on a wild ride through the ideological currents and shoals of 20th century thought.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Los Angeles Times\n\nSAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An intellectual feast, learned, lucid, challenging and accessible.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€San Francisco Chronicle\n\nTHE ECONOMIST\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fans will find plenty to sustain them in this poignant coda to a life marked by great feats of penmanship, scholarly insight and contemporary polemicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ [JudtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] bravery is ever-present, but rightly understated. As Mr Snyder notes in his introduction, the book is both about the life of the mind and a mindful life. Judt exemplified both.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Economist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0473e82f1983dae771ca1eed9bd128cf20c20671","amp;dn":"Tony+Judt+-+Thinking+the+20th+Century+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0473e82f1983dae771ca1eed9bd128cf20c20671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,115,232,47,25,131,218,231,113,202,30,237,155,209,40,207,32,194,6,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
