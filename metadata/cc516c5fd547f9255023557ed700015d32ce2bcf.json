They haven't changed their sound one bit, \nthough; they still sound like a lost band from 1971, somewhere between the U.K.-based Groundhogs and their \nfellow Swedes in November. The easiest modern comparison would be to Witchcraft, but Witchcraft's more occult\n lyrical focus, and influence from heavier acts like Pentagram, sets them apart from Graveyard's bare-bones \nboogie, which falls closer to Horisont. The title track of this album finds Graveyard at their most \nrip-roaring, offering a thunderous riff and some stinging guitar soloing. Other tracks throw little stylistic\n tweaks (background vocals on &quot;Buying Truth [Tack &amp; FÃƒÂ¶rlÃƒÂ¥t]&quot;) into the mix, but the basic formula stays the\n same. &quot;Longing&quot; is the token ballad, an instrumental with some whistling and subtle organ giving it an \nEnnio Morricone-ish desolation. The album ends with the one-two punch of the hard-rocking &quot;RSS&quot; and the \natmospheric, shifting (it starts soft and gets very loud), six-minute &quot;The Siren,&quot; an excellent showcase for\n the band's skilled rhythm section. Graveyard should be heard by any fan of retro hard rock. \n  \nsource: http://www.allmusic.com/album/hisingen-blues-mw0002113345\n\n=====================================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 - Aint Fit To Live Here.flac\nA2 - No Good, Mr Holden.flac\nA3 - Hisingen Blues.flac\nA4 - Uncomfortably Numb.flac\nB1 - Buying Truth.flac\nB2 - Longing.flac\nB3 - Ungrateful Are The Dead.flac\nB4 - Rss.flac\nB5 - The Siren.flac\n\n========================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 839 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Hisingen Blues\nPerformer                                : Graveyard\nGenre                                    : Blues Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2011\n\n============================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 011 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc516c5fd547f9255023557ed700015d32ce2bcf","amp;dn":"Graveyard+-+Hisingen+Blues+%282011%29+FLAC+24+Bit+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc516c5fd547f9255023557ed700015d32ce2bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,81,108,95,213,71,249,37,80,35,85,126,215,0,1,93,50,206,43,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
