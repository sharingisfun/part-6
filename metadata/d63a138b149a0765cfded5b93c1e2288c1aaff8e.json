The American version of the album was released two weeks earlier, on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records, with a different track listing. This is the first Beatles album to be recorded entirely on four-track tape, allowing for good stereo mixes.\n\nWhile showcasing the development of the band's songwriting talents, the album sticks to the basic rock and roll instrumentation and song format. The album contains some of their most famous songs, including the title track, with its distinct, instantly recognisable opening chord,  and the previously released &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;; both were transatlantic number-one singles for the band.\n\nThe title of the album was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: &quot;I was going home in the car and Dick Lester [director of the movie] suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in 'In His Own Write', but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'&quot;\n\nIn 2000, Q placed A Hard Day's Night at number five in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2012, A Hard Day's Night was voted 307th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;\n\nOn 9 September 2009, a remastered version of this album was released and was the first time the album appeared in stereo on compact disc in its entirety. This album is also included in The Beatles Stereo Box Set. A remastered mono version of the original UK album was part of The Beatles in Mono box set.\n\n2009 STEREO REMASTER [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:34\n02. \t&quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;   \tLennon \t2:43\n03. \t&quot;If I Fell&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:19\n04. \t&quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance with You&quot;   \tHarrison \t1:56\n05. \t&quot;And I Love Her&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:30\n06. \t&quot;Tell Me Why&quot;   \tLennon \t2:09\n07. \t&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:12\n08. \t&quot;Any Time at All&quot;   \tLennon \t2:11\n09. \t&quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot;   \tLennon \t1:46\n10. \t&quot;Things We Said Today&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:35\n11. \t&quot;When I Get Home&quot;   \tLennon \t2:17\n12. \t&quot;You Can't Do That&quot;   \tLennon \t2:35\n13. \t&quot;I'll Be Back&quot;   \tLennon \t2:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d63a138b149a0765cfded5b93c1e2288c1aaff8e","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+A+Hard+Day%27s+Night+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d63a138b149a0765cfded5b93c1e2288c1aaff8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,58,19,139,20,154,7,101,207,222,213,185,60,30,34,136,193,170,255,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
