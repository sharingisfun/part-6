Jeff Goldblum and \nGeena Davis star as Seth Brundle, a self-involved research scientist, and \nVeronica Quaife, a science-magazine reporter. Inviting Veronica to his lab, \nSeth prepares to demonstrate his telepod, which can theoretically transfer \nmatter through space. As they grow closer over the next few weeks, she \ninadvertently goads Seth into experimenting with human beings rather than \ninanimate objects. Seth himself enters the telepod, preparing to transmit \nhimself through the ether -- but he doesn't know that he is sharing the \ntelepod with a tiny housefly.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jeff Goldblum.\n=&gt;-Geena Davis.\n=&gt;-John Getz.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-David Cronenberg.\n\nThe Fly II 1989.\nA few months after a hideously deformed Seth Brundle was mercifully killed \nby his lover Veronica, she dies giving birth to Seth's son Martin. Martin \nis raised by Seth's evil employer Anton Bartok, who requires Martin's help \nto solve the problems of the Telepods, believing the Telepods are the key \nfor worldwide domination. Martin ages at an accelerated rate (being the \nequivalent of 20 human years old at the age of 5), and the fly genes he \ninherited from his father begin to transform him into Martinfly, who, \nunlike his sickly father, is a very deadly force to be reckoned with. \nBefriended by beautiful computer specialist Beth Logan, Martin sets out \nfor a way to cure himself, discovering that the answer lies within the \nTelepods.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Eric Stoltz.\n=&gt;-Daphne Zuniga.\n=&gt;-Lee Richardson.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Chris Walas.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Mystery : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1986 : 1989.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.35 GiB : 1.48 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 028 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 35mn : 1h 44mn.\n=&gt;-The Fly 1986...............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/\n=&gt;-The Fly 1986...............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007602-fly/\n=&gt;-The Fly II 1989............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097368/\n=&gt;-The Fly II 1989............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fly_ii/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 400.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1911 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 190 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f9e7d169e807aeed8a99aef47b1c8593316c11","amp;dn":"The+Fly+1%2C+2+-+Horror+Sci-Fi+1986+1989+Eng+Subs+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f9e7d169e807aeed8a99aef47b1c8593316c11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,249,231,209,105,232,7,174,237,138,153,174,244,123,28,133,147,49,108,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
