These materials are made by Cinema 4D artists and ready for professional production work.\n\nThe Artists\nTexture Kit Pro includes materials from four Cinema 4D artists. Beeple, Pariah Rob, Chris Schmidt and Greyscalegorilla. We hope to add more artists in future versions. Future materials will be included at no extra cost.\n\nThe Requirements.\nTexture Kit requires Cinema 4D 12 and above. All versions including Prime, Broadcast, Visualize and Studio are supported for most materials. Special materials like hair, displacement, and sub-surface-scattering materials will only work with Studio. Less than 10% of the included materials require Studio. NOTE: Texture Kit is fully compatible with Cinema 4D R14.\n\nEnjoy\n\nM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fedd58139aac50396542bd6a41bef3cfae8b5a2","amp;dn":"%26bull%3BGSG+Texure+Kit+Pro.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fedd58139aac50396542bd6a41bef3cfae8b5a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,237,213,129,57,170,197,3,150,84,43,214,164,27,239,60,250,232,181,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
