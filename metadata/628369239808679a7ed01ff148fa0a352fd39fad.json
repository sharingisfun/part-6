They reformed in 2001 to resume making music for Cole and making him proud that they were able to resume their career. In 2011, C &amp; C Music Factory has reformed with legendary producer Eric Kupper stepping in to replace Cole. Their first release, &quot;Rain&quot; featuring Scarlett Santana will be released in August of 2011.\n\nC+C Music Factory earned a total of 35 music industry awards worldwide, including five Billboard Awards, five American Music Awards, and two MTV Video Music Awards.
