Sullivan was now into \n\nwriting the 50 minutes episodes and it led to some great stories such as the episode opener Sky&amp;#039;s the \n\nLimit and followed with some other great episodes\n\nAnother plus was the idea of bringing back other characters like Roy Slater in Class of &amp;#039;62 as well as \n\nintroducing some great new ones like Tony Angelino in Stage Fright\n\n\nBrief: Del Boy and Rodney haven&amp;#039;t been in Miami a day yet they bumped into these nice &amp;#039;Family&amp;#039; boys at \n\nthe night club and they can stay with them.
