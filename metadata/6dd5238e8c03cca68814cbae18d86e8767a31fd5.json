Blending science and spirituality into startling insights, acclaimed revolutionary biologists Rupert Sheldrake and Bruce Lipton will show us the wonder and daring of their research and how it relates to our lives.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust as the electromagnetic field is an interface between the matter fields and the mental, psychic, and morphic aspects of ourselves as human beings, so the electromagnetic field could be playing a similar role in the mental structure of the soul of the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Rupert Sheldrake\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMany spiritual people anticipate the return of White Light to the planet. They imagine that it will come in the form of a unique individual like Buddha, Jesus or Muhammad. However, from my newly acquired spirituality, I see that White Light will only return to the planet when every human being recognizes every other human being as an individual frequency of the White Light.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Bruce Lipton\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn any generation, there are only a handful of people whose ideas contain the possibility of significantly altering the course of human history. Dr. Rupert Sheldrake is such a person. His ideas offer a real chance for humanity to regain its spiritual bearings. We have been blessed with a rare genius.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Larry Dossey, M.D., best-selling author of Healing Words\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBruce LiptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book is the definitive summary of the new biology and all it implies. It is magnificent, profound beyond words, and a delight to read. It synthesizes an encyclopedia of critical new information into a brilliant yet simple package. These pages contain a genuine revolution in thought and understanding, one so radical that it can change the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Joseph Chilton Pearce, Ph.D., author of Magical Child and EvolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s End\n\nRarely if ever in our lives do we have an extraordinary opportunity to directly participate with two of the most original thinkers on the planet. For the first and probably the only time two truly revolutionary biologists, Dr. Rupert Sheldrake and Dr. Bruce Lipton will come together for a history making event to blow the lid off of science in groundbreaking talks and experiential workshops. After experiencing their presentations in Seattle we will come away knowing that our world perspective must dramatically shift and magnificently expand, that our lives have changed. This is not an exaggerated claim but a preview of one of the greatest explorations into something truly grand which can uncover and undermine the falsity of the platforms upon which so much of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s limited perspectives stand.\n\nFACULTY\n\n \nRupert Sheldrake, Ph.D., one of the world&amp;#039;s most innovative biologists has revolutionized scientific thinking with his vision of a living, developing universe with its own inherent memory. He first worked in developmental biology and is best known for his theory of Morphic Fields and Morphic Resonance. His latest book, The Sence of Being Stared At develops his concept of the extended mind.\n\nDr. Sheldrake is author of more than 75 scientific papers and ten books. A former Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, where he was a Scholar of Clare College, took a double first class honors degree and was awarded the University Botany Prize. He then studied philosophy at Harvard University, where he was a Frank Knox Fellow, before returning to Cambridge, where he took a Ph.D. in biochemistry. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge University, where he carried out research on the development of plants and the ageing of cells. At Clare College he was also Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology. www.sheldrake.org\n \nBruce Lipton, Ph.D., is a pioneer of a new frontier in science that will do just thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one that gives us astonishing evidence on how our thoughts and beliefs control the destiny of our living bodies. He will show you how even at the cellular level you possess an innate intelligence that is far more crucial to shaping your life than even your genes. Since the publication of his groundbreaking book, The Biology of Belief, Bruce Lipton has received widespread acclaim as one of the most accessible and knowledgeable voices of the &quot;new biology.&quot; The new science is called epigeneticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a revolutionary field that shows how the energy of consciousness is as important in shaping life on earth as DNA and chemistry.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the past,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ explains Bruce, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe have been taught that we are like organic machines, a bundle of chemical reactions at the mercy of our own DNA.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This renowned researcher will reveal to you how epigenetics shatters the old, purely mechanistic model of life. Drawing upon insights from quantum physics, fractal mathematics, and an honest re-examination of long-held biological ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtruths,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he unveils a revolutionary vision of life science that illuminates the hidden connections between biology, psychology and spirituality. www.brucelipton.com\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd5238e8c03cca68814cbae18d86e8767a31fd5","amp;dn":"Rupert+Sheldrake+and+Bruce+Lipton+-+A+Quest+Beyond+the+Limits...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd5238e8c03cca68814cbae18d86e8767a31fd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,213,35,142,140,3,204,166,136,20,203,174,24,216,110,135,103,163,31,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
