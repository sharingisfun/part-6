The high technical level of their compositions usually makes people refer to their style as somewhat of a progressive metal or progressive rock band.\n\nFreak KitchenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as Ã¢â‚¬Å“A corny little heavy-pop-rock-latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-recordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nLyrics contain heavy criticism against capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of huge record companies.\n\nFrontman Mattias IA Eklundh is widely known as a guitarist of high technical ability, and live shows often contain parts where Eklundh plays the guitar using several foreign objects such as a vibrating dildo. Eklundh has also released three solo albums, Sensually Primitive (1997) (under the pseudonym Mr. Libido), Freak Guitar (1999) and The Road Less Traveled (2004).\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nMattias IA Eklundh Guitars, Vocals\nChrister Ãƒâ€“rtefors\tBass, Vocals\nBjÃƒÂ¶rn Fryklund\tDrums, Vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nAppetizer (1994)\nSpanking Hour (1996)\nFreak Kitchen (1998)\nDead Soul Men (2000)\nMove (2002)\nOrganic (2005)\nLand Of The Freaks (2009)\nCooking With Pagans (2014)\n\n\n\nCooking With Pagans (2014)\n\n\n\n01 - Professional Help\n02 - Freak of the Week\n03 - Sloppy\n04 - Goody Goody\n05 - (Saving up for an) Anal Bleach\n06 - Private Property\n07 - Mathematics of Defeat\n08 - I dont want to Golf\n09 - Hide\n10 - Come back to Comeback\n11 - Ranks of the terrified\n12 - Once upon a time in Scandinavistan\n\n\n\nAs requested by SKOM\nGenre:\tHeavy\nSubgenre:\tHeavy Metal / Hard Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t111.19 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n13 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539525d9352a4107bbee738699f5ea790341d66d","amp;dn":"Freak+Kitchen+-+Cooking+With+Pagans+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539525d9352a4107bbee738699f5ea790341d66d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,149,37,217,53,42,65,7,187,238,115,134,153,245,234,121,3,65,214,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
