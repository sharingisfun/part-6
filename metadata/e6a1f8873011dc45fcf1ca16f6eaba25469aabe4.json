The album's only flaw is its tendency to slip into almost emo-ish constructions (standard Braid and Boys Life moves) -- thankfully, though, this leaning is rare in comparison to the charming pop that makes When You Land Here so lovable. It's quite tempting to see the record as a promise of truly great things to come -- Flake Music could use a bit more focus and invention, and their work here leaves one hoping that future work will transform them from a charming but not incredibly inspired pop band into a truly brilliant project.\n\n  Review of the remastered version\n\n  First impressions aren't usually afforded a second chance, but somehow an obscure Albuquerque quartet called Flake Music found a loophole around the turn of the millenniumÃ¢â‚¬â€and now, 15 years after disbanding, they're at it again.  The group that reinvented itself as The Shins and, in turn, became an archetype of literate, engaging indie-rock (or, as a Natalie Portman character once famously said, the band capable of writing a life-changing song), is giving the world another opportunity to appreciate its one and only album for the first time. On Nov. 24, Sub Pop, in conjunction with frontman James Mercer's Aural Apothecary imprint, is reissuing Flake Music's When You Land Here, It's Time To Return.\n\n  But don't be mistaken: This updated edition isn't just the same old album (originally released in 1997 by Omnibus Records) with revised artwork slapped on the front. Sure, the tracklist hasn't changed, but unlike a lot of Ã¢â‚¬Å“remixed and remasteredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reissues that arrive relatively unaltered, sonically the new version of When You Land HereÃ¢â‚¬â€remixed by Grammy winner Kennie Takahashi (who's worked with Mercer's Broken Bells) and remastered by JJ GoldenÃ¢â‚¬â€is light years removed from the original","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a1f8873011dc45fcf1ca16f6eaba25469aabe4","amp;dn":"Flake+Music+-+When+You+Land+Here+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%28The+Shins%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a1f8873011dc45fcf1ca16f6eaba25469aabe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,161,248,135,48,17,220,69,252,241,202,22,246,234,186,37,70,154,171,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
