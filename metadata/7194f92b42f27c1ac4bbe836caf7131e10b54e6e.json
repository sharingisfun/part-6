Kinsella's emo/post-rock pedigree includes stints with bands like Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc; American Football share a similar aesthetic, blending jazzy tempos, pop hooks, and earnest vocals into their sound. The group released its self-titled debut EP in 1998 and its eponymous full-length in 1999 before abruptly breaking up after only a few years of existence. Kinsella went on to perform solo as Owen, as well as with his brother Tim in the equally elusive rock group Owls. American Football's legacy would grow following their dissolution, with new fans discovering their album as it went through various re-pressings over the years. In 2014 the band reunited for a handful of shows to celebrate the album's 15th anniversary reissue, which included unreleased bonus tracks and demo recordings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7194f92b42f27c1ac4bbe836caf7131e10b54e6e","amp;dn":"American+Football+%28LP2%29+%282016%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7194f92b42f27c1ac4bbe836caf7131e10b54e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,148,249,43,66,242,124,26,196,187,232,54,202,247,19,30,16,181,78,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
