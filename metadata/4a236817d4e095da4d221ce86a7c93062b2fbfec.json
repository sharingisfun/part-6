Her works explore the challenge of remaining Jewish in contemporary American life, the reconstruction of identity after immigration, trauma and movement from one class to another.  In addition to her award-winning fiction, Ozick is also an accomplished writer on politics, history, and literary criticism.\r\n\r\nThe novelist David Foster Wallace called Ozick one of the greatest living American writers.  She has been variously described as &quot;the Athena of Americaâ€™s literary pantheon,&quot; the &quot;Emily Dickinson of the Bronx,&quot; and &quot;one of the most accomplished and graceful literary stylists of her time.&quot;\r\n\r\nNo serious reader should miss &quot;The Shawl&quot; (1980), a devastating vision of the Holocaust and the unfillable emptiness it left in the lives of those who passed through it.\r\n\r\nI am especially indebted to @pharmakate for six of the PDFs in this collection, several of which have not been publicly posted before now.
