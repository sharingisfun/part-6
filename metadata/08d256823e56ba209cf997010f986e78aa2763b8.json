This lavishly illustrated volume brings together for the first time all of the MuseumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Walker Evans holdings. \n\nIncluded here are familiar imagesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photographs of tenant farmers and their families, made in the 1930s and later published in Let Us Now Praise Famous MenÃ¢â‚¬â€and images that are much less familiarÃ¢â‚¬â€such as the photographs Evans made in the 1940s of the winter quarters of the Ringling Brothers circus, or his very late Polaroids, made in the 1970s. In addition, many previously unpublished Evans photographs, and variant croppings of classic images, appear here for the first time. \n\nAuthor Judith Keller has written a lively, informative text that places these photographs in the larger context of EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and career and the cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€especially the popular cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€of the time. In so doing, she has produced an indispensible volume for anyone interested in the history of photography or American culture in the twentieth century. \n\nAlso included is the most comprehensive bibliography on Walker Evans published to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d256823e56ba209cf997010f986e78aa2763b8","amp;dn":"Walker+Evans+-+Catalogue+of+the+Collection+%28Art+Photography+Eboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d256823e56ba209cf997010f986e78aa2763b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,210,86,130,62,86,186,32,156,249,151,1,15,152,110,120,170,39,99,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
