For this new EP the duo wired an Oberheim 4 Voice and a Korg PS3100 to the mixing desk and performed live takes on both instruments. With all four hands on its pots, all mixes were recorded straight onto 2-track Â½-inch tape. Like on 'Stare', their first collaborative affair in 2012, they simply followed what was laying in front of them, and this time they were driven by some new synths, a kick drum and tape effects. Indulging in dub, the tracks where all performed rather than engineered, with Ã“lafur riding a few elements on faders and Nils bringing effects in and out. After running several mixes, they went for the five strongest moments from this session. The release was announced on a joint website www.arnaldsfrahm.com together with the launch of an intimate 45-minute studio film titled 'Trance Frendz', featuring another seven improvisations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baac7141a04f363df016be88c9dc5ed5b62e70fb","amp;dn":"O%CC%81lafur+Arnalds+%26amp%3B+Nils+Frahm+-+Loon+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baac7141a04f363df016be88c9dc5ed5b62e70fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,172,113,65,160,79,54,61,240,22,190,136,201,220,94,213,182,46,112,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
