Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold. Over the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity had dissipated by the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\nHi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1980 (see 1980 in music).
