Saxist/flautist Charles Lloyd's masterstroke was the discovery of two young rising giants in pianist Keith Jarrett and drummer Jack DeJohnette.\n\nLloyd's querulous flute-playing is an acquired taste, but his biting, bagpipe-like tenor tone and rough, impulsively sketched lines are full of character. The 21-year-old Jarrett is a volcano of invention, while the power of Cecil McBee and DeJohnette on bass and drums establishes just why this band was such a success with rock crowds.\n\n \n\nStraight, no Chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb1b7b209d5f73ef8e2bf2c01c7e8549865b358","amp;dn":"Charles+Lloyd+-+Dream+Weaver+1966+%2F+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb1b7b209d5f73ef8e2bf2c01c7e8549865b358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,177,183,178,9,213,247,62,248,226,191,44,1,199,232,84,152,101,179,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
