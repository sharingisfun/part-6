This magical story, A Walk to Remember, tells of a truly unexpected love - one that changes a young manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life forever.\n\n  Class of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢59 high school senior Landon Carter spends his time trying to stay out of trouble in the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina. The last person heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever fall for is quiet Jamie Sullivan, the Baptist ministerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter. But when he waits too long to get a date for the homecoming dance, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the only one left to ask. While his friends make jokes about the unlikely couple, he decides this will be their first and last date. But Jamie has a way of shaking up his plans, and LandonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life goes down a path he never dreamed possible. A master storyteller, Nicholas Sparks transports you to a simpler time and place. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find yourself smiling through your tears with Frank MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heartwarming performance.\n\n\n  From Wiki:\n\n  The novel, set in the mid-1950s in Beaufort, North Carolina, is a story of two teenagers who fall in love with each other despite the disparity of their personalities.
