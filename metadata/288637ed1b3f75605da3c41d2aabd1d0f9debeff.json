He reveals the hidden structure of screenplays, sequences, and scenes, as he guides you through the process of examining your draft, restructuring it, and \n\npopulating it with believable, complex, and compelling characters. Along the way he outlines how to make your action leap off the page and your dialogue crackle. While the first \n\nedition was widely used in film school rewriting classes, it was also recommended as an introduction to screenwriting craft by a number of professors and professionals. Paul \n\nChitlik has included, for the second edition, more examples, exercises, and applications for television, the web, and other media, using a wide range of citations in film, \n\ntelevision, and the Internet to underline his approach.
