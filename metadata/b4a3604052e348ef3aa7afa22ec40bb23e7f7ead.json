I have had this \n\nmany years. It STILL works fine. Enjoy :)***\n\n\nSketchUp is a 3D modeling program for applications such as \n\narchitectural, interior design, civil and mechanical engineering, \n\nfilm, and video game design. A freeware version, SketchUp \n\nMake, and a paid version with additional functionality, SketchUp \n\nPro, are available.\n\n\nSketchUp was developed by startup company @Last Software of \n\nBoulder, Colorado, co-founded in 1999 by Brad Schell, and Joe \n\nEsch.\n\n\nSketchUp debuted in August 2000 as a general-purpose 3D \n\ncontent creation tool, and was envisioned as a software program \n\n&quot;that would allow design professionals to draw the way they \n\nwant by emulating the feel and freedom of working with pen and \n\npaper in a simple and elegant interface, that would be fun to \n\nuse and easy to learn, and that would be used by designers to \n\nplay with their designs in a way that is not possible with \n\ntraditional design software. It also has user friendly buttons to \n\nmake it easier to use.\n\n\nThe program claims to be easy to use. There is an online Open \n\nsource repository of free-of-charge model assemblies (e.g., \n\nwindows, doors, automobiles, etc.), 3D Warehouse, to which \n\nusers may contribute models. The program includes drawing \n\nlayout functionality, allows surface rendering in variable &quot;styles&quot;, \n\nsupports third-party &quot;plug-in&quot; programs hosted on a site called \n\nExtension Warehouse to provide other capabilities (e.g., near \n\nphoto-realistic rendering), and enables placement of its models \n\nwithin Google Earth.\n\n\nGoogle acquired @Last Software on March 14, 2006 for an \n\nestimated $15-45mm, attracted by @Last's Software's work \n\ndeveloping a plugin for Google Earth.\n\n\nOn January 9, 2007, SketchUp 6 was released, with new tools \n\nand a beta version of Google SketchUp LayOut. LayOut includes \n\n2D vector tools and page layout tools allowing presentations to \n\nbe produced without the need for a separate presentation \n\nprogram.\n\n\nOn November 17, 2008, SketchUp 7 was released, with \n\nchanges intended to make it easier to use, integration of \n\nSketchUp's Component Browser with Google 3D Warehouse, \n\nLayOut 2, and dynamic components that respond to scaling. \n\nWindows 2000 was no longer supported.\n\n\nSketchUp was independent from 2000 to 2006 and then owned \n\nby Google from 2006 to 2012.\n\n\nSketchUp is currently owned by Trimble Navigation, a mapping, \n\nsurveying, and navigation equipment company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4a3604052e348ef3aa7afa22ec40bb23e7f7ead","amp;dn":"Google+SketchUp+Pro+7+-+Version+7.0.8657","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4a3604052e348ef3aa7afa22ec40bb23e7f7ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,163,96,64,82,227,72,239,58,167,175,162,46,196,11,178,62,127,126,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
