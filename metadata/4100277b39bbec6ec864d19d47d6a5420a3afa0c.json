On most general medical rotations and on most surgical wards there are patients with hepatological problems. Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered contains clinical presentations with real-life patient cases and outcomes as seen on the wards and in exams, and leads students through a practical approach to diagnosis and management of hepatological disease.\nFollowing a question and answer approach, including self-assessment material and a Ã¢â‚¬ËœrefresherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ section on the basic science, Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered features investigations and the treatment options available for patients presenting with hepatological problems. Difficult concepts are clarified and relevant links are made between pathology and clinical presentation.\n\nHepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered is ideal for medical students, junior doctors on the Foundation Programme, GP trainees, residents, specialist nurses and nurse practitioners. The book is also an ideal refresher for hepatology or gastroenterology trainees at the beginning of their specialist training programme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4100277b39bbec6ec864d19d47d6a5420a3afa0c","amp;dn":"Hepatology%2C+Clinical+Cases+Uncovered+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4100277b39bbec6ec864d19d47d6a5420a3afa0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,0,39,123,57,187,236,110,200,100,209,157,71,214,165,66,10,58,250,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
