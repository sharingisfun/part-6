In 2000 a follow-up expedition, Terra Circa, was organised by Dave Greenhough, brother of one of the Mondo Enduro team members. It was the first motorbike expedition to cross the infamous Zilov Gap.\n\nThe route went from London across Europe, western Russia and Siberia to Vladivostok. The team then embarked for Japan and returned to Europe crossing the United States.\n\nLike its predecessor, Terra Circa is a shoestring expedition with rough camping the order of the day and has a cult following amongst adventure motorcyclists.\n\nThe expedition was filmed and made into a six part TV series, shown on British cable channel Men &amp; Motors.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mondoenduro.com/terracirca.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mondoenduro.com/terracirca.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a697d4dc85678b48d575d63b380d57d113114bc7","amp;dn":"Terra+Circa+DVDRip+-+Around+the+World+on+Motorcycles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a697d4dc85678b48d575d63b380d57d113114bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,151,212,220,133,103,139,72,213,117,214,59,56,13,87,209,19,17,75,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
