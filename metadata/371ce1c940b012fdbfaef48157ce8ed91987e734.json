Searching more for a learned appreciation of nature and our exact place within the cosmos than academic scientific knowledge, science and travel writer Jamie Carter takes the reader on a 12 month tour of the night sky's incredible annual rhythms that say so much about Earth. During the journey he learns about the celestial mechanics at work in the skies above that are â€“ to the beginner â€“ almost beyond belief. As well as the vital constellations and clusters, and the weird and wonderful nebulas, he searches out â€œdark sky destinationsâ€ across the globe that help increase knowledge and give a new perspective on familiar night sky sights. On the journey he witnesses a solar eclipse and grapples with star-charts, binoculars, smartphone apps, telescopes, spots satellites and attempts basic astro-photography. By year's end, the reader will be able to glance at the night sky from anywhere on the planet and tell what direction he or she is facing, what time it is, where all the planets are and even where the Galactic Center Point is","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371ce1c940b012fdbfaef48157ce8ed91987e734","amp;dn":"A+Stargazing+Program+for+Beginners+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371ce1c940b012fdbfaef48157ce8ed91987e734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,28,225,201,64,176,18,253,191,174,244,129,87,206,142,217,25,135,231,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
