I was completely won over the first time I heard this opulent recording from the award-winning Polyphony.\n\nMORTEN LAURIDSEN (b. 1943) is an American composer whose works are performed around the world.  In 2007 he received the National Medal of Arts &quot;for his composition of radiant choral works combining musical beauty, power and spiritual depth that have thrilled audiences worldwide.&quot;\n\nLUX AETERNA (1997) is made up of five different liturgical texts, beginning with the Introit from the Requiem Mass and ending with the Agnus Dei from the Mass Ordinary.  It is filled with Lauridsen's trademark sounds: full, lush textures using a relatively restricted (or at least slowly evolving) palette of harmonies and thus making music with a contemporary kind of calming resonance.  It was greeted by The Times after its London premiere as &quot;a classic of new American choral writing . . . in this light-filled continuum of sacred texts, old world structures and new world spirit intertwine in a cunningly written score, at once sensuous and spare.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n01. Lux aeterna - Introitus\n02. Lux aeterna - In te, Domine, speravi\n03. Lux aeterna - O nata lux\n04. Lux aeterna - Veni, Sancte Spiritus\n05. Lux aeterna - Agnus Dei - Lux aeterna\n06. Madrigali - Ov'ÃƒÂ¨, lass', il bel viso?\n07. Madrigali - Quando son piÃƒÂ¹ lontan\n08. Madrigali - Amor, io sento l'alma\n09. Madrigali - Io piango\n10. Madrigali - Luci serene e chiare\n11. Madrigali - Se per havervi, oime\n12. Ave Maria\n13. Ubi caritas et amor\n14. O magnum mysterium\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;The music has freshness and an affecting emotional pull to it that explains its popularity with singers and audiences across the pond. Stephen Layton's Polyphony, whose recent recordings of PÃƒÂ¤rt, Tavener and others have been revelations of choral singing, brings a comparable firmness, tonal opulence and refinement to this new repertoire, which will undoubtedly gain new admirers as a result.&quot; -- Daily Telegraph\n\n&quot;Layton and company have here produced the finest I've heard among several excellent collections of Lauridsen's work. None are quite as exquisitely nuanced or sung with such glowing vocal sheen as this. Clear and shimmering sound, plus Hyperion's usual complete and user-friendly booklet, make it all the more attractive. No committed choral fan or singer will ever regret letting Lauridsen into his life.&quot; -- American Record Guide\n\n&quot;Stephen Layton's feel for the inner line and structure melts the heart, as does the impeccable, unforced singing of Polyphony. Their music-making remains in heavenly realms throughout the virtuoso Madrigali: pure choral gold.&quot; -- Classic FM Magazine\n\n&quot;Every one of the works on this mesmerising Hyperion release is deliciously lyrical and harmonically sumptuous, but spiced with delicate dissonances that are Lauridsen's signature. . . Every performance here is delivered with liquid perfection.&quot; -- The Scotsman\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
