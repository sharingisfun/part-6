The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple. Development of the album was often troubled; the album's original producer, British record producer Ken Nelson, was supposed to produce much of the album, however, many songs written during their sessions were ditched due to the band's dissatisfaction. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code.\n\nThe album contains twelve tracks and an additional hidden track, &quot;Til Kingdom Come&quot;. It is omitted from the track listing on the album sleeve, but listed as &quot;+&quot; on the disc label and inside the album booklet. It was originally planned for American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash to record it with Martin, but Cash died before he was able to do so.[1] The song &quot;Talk&quot; appeared on the main track listing, although it was thought to have been downgraded to a B-side for the album's subsequent single releases, after it leaked online in early 2005.[2]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrack list:\n01.
