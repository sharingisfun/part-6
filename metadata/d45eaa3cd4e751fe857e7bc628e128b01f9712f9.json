Dream Pinball 3D - with its six cutting-edge tables - is beckoning you to try your luck and skills.\nIn addition, we did not skimp on the technology with this game as there are six different style balls, made of different materials, that not only look different, but whose ballistic characteristics will affect the very rolling behaviour of each one of them. Add to that incredible acoustics, state-of-the-art particle technology, HDRI and multilayer 3D sound, a realistic tilt function and motion blur effects and you have the best pinball experience available on the PC that can even be enjoyed on laptops and less powerful, non-gaming computers...\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................simulation / action / pinball\nDownload size:...........................269 MB\nRelease date:.............................August 31, 2006\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................A.S.K.
