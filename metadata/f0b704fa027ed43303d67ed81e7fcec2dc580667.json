With five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and six number one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975) and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \r\n\r\nThe Eagles are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 150 million recordsâ€”100 million in the U.S. aloneâ€”including 42 million copies of Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975) and 32 million copies of Hotel California. &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975)&quot; was the best selling album of the 20th century in the U.S. They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and the highest-selling American band in U.S. history.\r\n\r\nNow a few words from analogkid6103,that's me your uploader.\r\n\r\nThis compilation created In Rememberance of Glenn Frey.\r\nAs a band they were not known per se as a Heavy band. So over the \r\ncareer of the Eagles as a band and in the solo efforts I pulled these \r\ntracks together.\r\n\r\n(Warning: If you were looking for a Best Of...The Eagles album\r\n stop now and split cause this aint that.) \r\n\r\nSome of these are far more dark than even I expected.\r\nBut not everyday do you have a peaceful,easy feeling. \r\nAnd so I bring these. \r\n\r\nI went through most of the solo albums as well \r\nalthough I did not even bother with Timothy B. Schmitt and I Should \r\nhave looked a bit more at Randy Meisner's solo efforts. I focused on \r\nFelder,Frey and Henley. As most of you did as well. Although Meisner \r\ndid/does have a very devoted following. \r\nAnd Joe Walsh well his is a story yet to be told. And sometime it will.\r\nNo doubt by an ordinary average guy. \r\nEnjoy and cherish the memories cause at the end of the day thats all we \r\ngot. \r\n\r\nThe Eagles Edgy And Heavy A Compilation\r\n\r\nFormat:   mp3\r\n\r\nBitrate:  320kbps \r\n\r\nExcept for tracks 04,11,14,29,32\r\nwhich are 212kbps\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist's\r\n\r\nCD-1\r\n\r\n01.Dirty Laundry\r\n\r\n02.Smugglers Blues\r\n\r\n03 Outlaw Man\r\n\r\n04 James Dean\r\n\r\n05 The Disco Strangler\r\n\r\n06 Guilty Of The Crime\r\n\r\n07 Asphalt Jungle\r\n\r\n08 Business As Usual\r\n\r\n09 Turn to Stone\r\n\r\n10 Fire Lake\r\n\r\n11 Good Day In Hell\r\n\r\n12 Road To Forever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD-2\r\n\r\n13 Life's Been Good\r\n\r\n14 On The Border\r\n\r\n15 Haywire\r\n\r\n16 Bad Girls\r\n\r\n17 Life in the Fast Lane\r\n\r\n18 Somebody\r\n\r\n19 In The City\r\n\r\n20 Long Road Out Of Eden\r\n\r\n21 A Life of Illusion\r\n\r\n22 The Border\r\n\r\n23 Girls in Black\r\n\r\n24 King Of Hollywood\r\n\r\n\r\nCD-3\r\n\r\n25 You Dont Have Me\r\n\r\n26 Already Gone\r\n\r\n27 Victim of Love\r\n\r\n28.You Dont Know Me At All\r\n\r\n29 Heavy Metal (Takin a Ride)\r\n\r\n30 Journey of the Sorcerer\r\n\r\n31 Too Many Hands\r\n\r\n32 All of You\r\n\r\n33 Walk Away\r\n\r\n34 All Those Lies\r\n\r\n35 Fast Company\r\n\r\n36 Teenage Jail\r\n\r\n37 Chug All Night\r\n\r\n38 Take the Devil\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Don Henley â€“ vocals, drums, percussion, guitars (1971â€“1980, 1994â€“present)\r\n    Joe Walsh â€“ vocals, guitars, keyboards (1975â€“1980, 1994â€“present)\r\n    Timothy B.
