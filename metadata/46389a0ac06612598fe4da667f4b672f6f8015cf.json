He meets Jim Barrett, whose Chateau Montelena is mortgaged to the hilt as Jim perfects his chardonnay. There's strain in Jim's relations with his hippie son Bo and his foreman Gustavo, a Mexican farmworker's son secretly making his own wine. Plus, there's Sam, a UC Davis graduate student and free spirit, mutually attracted to both Gustavo and Bo. As Spurrier organizes the &quot;Judgment of Paris,&quot; Jim doesn't want to participate while Bo knows it's their only chance. Barrett's chardonnay has buttery notes and a Smithsonian finish. \n\nDirector: Randall Miller\nWriters: Jody Savin (screenplay), Randall Miller (screenplay)\nStars: Chris Pine, Alan Rickman and Bill Pullman\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914797/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914797/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSOURCE .........: Bottle Shock 2008 BluRay 1080i MPEG-2 DD 2.0-CHDBits\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 5806 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDiO 1.........: English AC3 2.0 192Kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 1:44:12 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.778 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1280 X 720\nSUBTiTLES.......: N/A\nFilE SiZE.......: 4.36G\nENCODER.........: youlong@CHD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46389a0ac06612598fe4da667f4b672f6f8015cf","amp;dn":"Bottle.Shock.2008.720p.BluRay.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46389a0ac06612598fe4da667f4b672f6f8015cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,56,154,10,192,102,18,89,143,228,218,102,127,75,103,47,111,128,21,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
