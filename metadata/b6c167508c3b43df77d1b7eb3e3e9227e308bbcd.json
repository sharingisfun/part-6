After a job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, he wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne (J.T. Walsh) mistakes him for a hit man, &quot;Lyle from Dallas,&quot; whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash--&quot;half now, half later&quot;-- Michael doesn't correct him and takes the money. Michael then visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) and attempts to warn her that her life is in dangerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½instead of killing her. She then makes a tempting counteroffer to him. Michael, knowing that the longer he stays in town the more danger he'll get into, continually tries to leave town, with no success. He complicates matters when he becomes romantically involved with Suzanne, and has to dodge bullets when &quot;Lyle from Dallas&quot; (Dennis Hopper) the real hitman finally shows up.\n\nDirected by John Dahl \nProduced by Steve Golin\nSigurjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Sighvatsson \nWritten by John Dahl\nRick Dahl\n \nStarring\nNicolas Cage\nLara Flynn Boyle\nDennis Hopper\nJ.T.
