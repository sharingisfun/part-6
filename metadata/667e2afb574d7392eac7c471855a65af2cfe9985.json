Oxford professor of mathematics, Marcus du Sautoy, explores the 30,000-year history of maths, examining the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how, in a multitude of surprising ways, they underpin the science, technology, and culture that shape our world. Four-part series about the history of mathematics, presented by Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy.\n\nThe Language of the Universe\nAfter showing how fundamental mathematics is to our lives, du Sautoy explores the mathematics of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. In Egypt, he uncovers use of a decimal system based on ten fingers of the hand, while in former Mesopotamia he discovers that the way we tell the time today is based on the Babylonian Base 60 number system. In Greece, he looks at the contributions of some of the giants of mathematics including Plato, Euclid, Archimedes and Pythagoras, who is credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 57mn 56s 209ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Science/Educational\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 985 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 123 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:667e2afb574d7392eac7c471855a65af2cfe9985","amp;dn":"BBC.The+Story+of+Maths+%282009%29.1of4.WS.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"667e2afb574d7392eac7c471855a65af2cfe9985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,126,42,251,87,77,115,146,234,199,196,113,133,90,101,175,44,254,153,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
