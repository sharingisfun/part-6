This set has been audited down to the checksums by ClrMamePro.   99.6% of the MAME 0.172 roms are here.   &quot;Missing List&quot; included. (138 of 31759 sets missing.  Gotta Catch 'Em All! :)\r\n\r\nSplit Sets.   Romsets &quot;zipped&quot; with 7-zip (it's the future!).  Disc 1, #-M.  Disc 2, N-Z.\r\n\r\n(Note:  Wondering why these are stored as ISOs?   If the content was just a list of 7z files, the torrent file becomes too large for TPB to accept.   This is the best compromise.)\r\n\r\nAnd BTW, a torrent with the missing roms would be very welcome, if someone is feeling industrious =]\r\n\r\nshare &amp; enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81b6b223bdb0f60f3e5f26c861d73608a9f364c","amp;dn":"Mame.Rom.Starter.Set.m172-99.6.Percent.Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81b6b223bdb0f60f3e5f26c861d73608a9f364c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,27,107,34,59,219,15,96,243,229,242,108,134,29,115,96,138,159,54,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
