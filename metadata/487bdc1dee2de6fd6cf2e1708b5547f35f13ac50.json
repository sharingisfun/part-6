Edward Griffin.\n\nThis is a video adaptation of a documentary filmstrip which explains the \nscientific rationale for Laetrile therapy. It presents evidence that cancer, \nlike scurvy or pellagra, is a deficiency disease. It is not caused by the \npresence of some mysterious virus or X- factor, but by the lack of an \nessential food factor which, increasingly, is deleted from the menus of \nmodern man. The native diets of those cultures where cancer is rare is \nexamined and found to be 200 times more rich in this substance than the diet \nof industrialized society. The missing food factor is called amygdalin or \nvitamin B17, but in its concentrated and purified form developed specifically \nfor cancer therapy, it is known as Laetrile. A theoretical model for the \nbiological action of Laetrile is presented. Included are dramatic case \nhistories of terminal cancer patients who have recovered using Laetrile \ntherapy. Based upon the book of the same name.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cancure.org/sources_of_information.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cancure.org/sources_of_information.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vitaminb17.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vitaminb17.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:487bdc1dee2de6fd6cf2e1708b5547f35f13ac50","amp;dn":"G.+Edward+Griffin+-+World+Without+Cancer+%28The+Story+of+Vitamin+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"487bdc1dee2de6fd6cf2e1708b5547f35f13ac50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,123,220,29,238,45,230,253,108,242,225,112,139,85,71,243,95,19,172,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
