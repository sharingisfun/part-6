It recounts the struggle of Spiegelman&amp;#039;s father to survive the Holocaust as a Polish Jew and draws largely on his father&amp;#039;s recollections of his experiences. The book also follows the author&amp;#039;s troubled relationship with his father and the way the effects of war reverberate through generations of a family.
