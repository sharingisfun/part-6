Miller (Author)\nHardcover: 306 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (January 7, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1107025303\nISBN-13: 978-1107025301\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: January 7, 2013\nWhy is it that terrorism has become such a central factor in our lives despite all the efforts to eradicate it? Ranging from early modern Europe to the contemporary Middle East, Martin Miller reveals the foundations of modern terrorism. He argues that the French Revolution was a watershed moment as it was then that ordinary citizens first claimed the right to govern. The traditional notion of state legitimacy was forever altered and terrorism became part of a violent contest over control of state power between officials in government and insurgents in society. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries terrorism evolved into a way of seeing the world and a way of life for both insurgents and state security forces with the two sides drawn ever closer in their behaviour and tactics. This is a groundbreaking history of terrorism which, for the first time, integrates the violence of governments and insurgencies.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Miller has written a splendid scene-shifting narrative of dilemmas of power, with cameos of individual terrorists, theoreticians of terror, architects of state terror, and scenes of terror across the globe. His study offers deep understanding of the basic and enduring reasons for both Red and White Terror.&quot; Philip Pomper, Wesleyan University\n\n&quot;Martin Miller has written a fresh and provocative history of terrorism from the French Revolution to the contemporary world. By spotlighting the dynamic interplay between terrorist movements and the modern state, its security apparatuses and 'wars on terrorism', Miller compels readers to rethink the origins, nature, and scope of terrorism in its broadest sense. This important book demonstrates the fundamental significance of history to contemporary debates about terrorism and state violence.&quot; Susan Morrissey, University College London\n\n&quot;The Foundations of Modern Terrorism is an unusual, well-written and fascinating study of the relationship between rebel and state terror from the French Revolution to the end of the twentieth century. The first serious study of a very important problem, it will intrigue everyone interested in the terrorism, provoke many future studies and be a landmark in the discipline.&quot;\nDavid C. Rapoport, founding and co-editor, Journal of Terrorism and Political Violence\n\n&quot;Evenhanded, clear, dispassionate in tone, and wide ranging in scope, this book gathers the work of specialized research into one convenient account. Useful indeed.&quot; Choice\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description II\nRanging from early modern Europe to the contemporary Middle East, this is a groundbreaking history of the roots of modern terrorism.
