This makes him so enjoyable and entertaining to listen to that it is easy to miss the import of his message. Zinn is an erudite historian, drawing on a broad base of knowledge. Using the same resources available to fellow historians and verifiable by any interested listener, he comes up with an alternative history of the United States that is not taught in schools. Part of his value as a historian is that fact that he brings to life important, but forgotten figures of the past, and he brings to light the facts and details of historic episodes that can be recalled by name but of which little more is known.\n\nHoward Zinn is the author of the best-selling ''People's History Of The United States'' (over a million copies sold), and numerous other works of history, politics, and biography..\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:40:46\n\n\n1  Historical Education\t\t\t\n2  Finding Anarchism\t\t\t\n3  Make Some Connection\t\t\t\n4  Cigar Strikes &amp; The Gilded Age\t\t\t\n5  Haymarket\t\t\t\n6  Manhattan Cafes\t\t\t\n7  Homestead\t\t\t\n8  Direct Action\t\t\t\n9  Assassin\t\t\t\n10 I'll Talk When I Damn Please\t\t\t\n11 In Love With the King of Hobos\t\t\t\n12 On Trial\t\t\t\n13 In Prison &amp; the Ussr\t\t\t\n14 Exile\t\t\t\n15 Alternative History\t\t\t\n16 Justice Is Always Alive\t\t\t\n17 Sedition\t\t\t\n18 Bomb &amp; The Palmer Raids\t\t\t\n19 Are You an Anarchist?\t\t\t\n20 They're Italians\t\t\t\n21 They Ran Like Foreigners\t\t\t\n22 Three Important Citizens\t\t\t\n23 Execution\t\t\t\n24 Struggle For Existence\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b1f9656e54fca67004386b9f7088f86a177fcd0","amp;dn":"Howard+Zinn+-+Heroes+And+Martyrs+-+Emma+Goldman%2C+Sacco+%26+Venzett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b1f9656e54fca67004386b9f7088f86a177fcd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,31,150,86,229,79,202,103,0,67,134,185,247,8,143,134,161,119,252,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
