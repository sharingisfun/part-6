Having already introduced itself to the pop mainstream with the salsa-tinged single &quot;I Need to Know,&quot; Marc Anthony offers several other obvious crossover hits, ranging from the Rodney Jerkins-produced Latin-funk fusion of &quot;She's Been Good to Me&quot; to the lovelorn midtempo ballad &quot;When I Dream at Night.&quot; However, Anthony's agreeably keening voice is too often applied to the sort of colorless adult-contemporary material typical of Michael Bolton and Mariah Carey mainstay Walter Afansieff, who produces or coproduces three tracks here. The result is often more interesting in sociological terms--Anthony fans who, like the star, were born to Latino parents in America are as sure to eat this disc up as his new Caucasian admirers--than in musical ones.
