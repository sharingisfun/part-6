As well as advising about the timing of jobs in the garden throughout the year and in all Australian climate zones, it gives suggestions about garden-related events and celebrations for each month. Mary Horsfall wants people to realize that gardens are for much more than working in and the book begins with a discussion about the importance of gardens and plants in our lives, public gardens as well as private ones.\n\nMonthly chapters have been structured to make as much information as possible generally relevant to gardeners across the country. Each month includes topics such as planning, bushfire preparation, watering, pot plant care, mulching, weeding, fertilizing, pruning, propagating, pest control and what to plant for different climate zones.\n\nEach month, Mary details my own gardening year, including jobs done, fruits and veggies harvested, food cooked based on the harvest, what was in flower and wildlife observations. Each month has a special topic of the month, which is examined in detail. Some of these include fun for kids in the garden, biodiversity, manipulating microclimate, and fragrance and first aid.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66806520a865ac08c0b8de5adfe52bdb3b727ff8","amp;dn":"Gardens+for+All+Seasons+2013+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66806520a865ac08c0b8de5adfe52bdb3b727ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,128,101,32,168,101,172,8,192,184,222,90,223,229,43,219,59,114,127,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
