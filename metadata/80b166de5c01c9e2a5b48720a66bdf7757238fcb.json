As the 1960's drifted into the 1970's, they started making recordings with two girl singers (who later became their wives), a working relationship that would continue until August 1982. During that period the foursome recorded a collection of songs which heralded one of the most successful recording careers the world has ever known and claimed a unique place in the history of popular music. That quartet was of course Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, better known as ABBA, and this book is the story of those people and their recordings. Based on extensive research and countless hours of original interviews with all four members of ABBA, their engineer Michael B. Tretow and many of their musicians that played with the band, ABBA - The Complete Recording Sessions recounts their story in a way that has never been told before. Beginning with that very first mid-60's recording session and tracing the formation of the group through their first tentative collaborations, Carl Magnus Palm takes us on a fascinating journey through ABBA's sensational career. He recounts the full story behind such hits as &quot;SOS', &quot;Dancing Queen,&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Game.&quot; He reveals the facts behind ABBA's final years and such classics as &quot;The Winner Takes It All.&quot; and the &quot;The Day Before You Came,&quot; as well as many lesser known tracks.\n\nPublisher: Verulam Publishing Ltd (October 13, 1994)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0907938108\nISBN-13: 978-0907938101\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions\nBy Bjorn Viberg on March 19, 2005\nAbba was and is one of major disco groups of all time and this little tidbit is not to be missed by major fans like myself. I have always loved their carefree attitude towards life, music and lyrics. This book talks about all the recording seesions from their first till their last. The photos present a time capsule and shows the fashion, technology and hairstyles. It is very interesting the see what they themselves thought about different tracks and I would have to say that this is for me a keeper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b166de5c01c9e2a5b48720a66bdf7757238fcb","amp;dn":"Abba++The+Complete+Recording+Sessions%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b166de5c01c9e2a5b48720a66bdf7757238fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,177,102,222,92,1,201,226,165,180,135,32,166,107,223,119,87,35,143,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
