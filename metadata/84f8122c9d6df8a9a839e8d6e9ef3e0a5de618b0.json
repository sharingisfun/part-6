Twain, disgusted\nwith the Human Race, is intent upon finding Halley's Comet and crashing into it,\nachieving his &quot;destiny.&quot; It's up to Tom, Becky, and Huck to convince him that his\njudgement is wrong, and that he still has much to offer humanity that might make\na difference. Their efforts aren't just charitable; if they fail, they will\nshare Twain's fate. Along the way, they use a magical time portal to get a\ndetailed overview of the Twain philosophy, observing the &quot;historical&quot; events\nthat inspired his works.\n\nVideo Codec:\tXVID\nContainer:\tOpenDML (AVI v2.0)\nResolution:\t640 x 352\nFrames/sec:\t23.976\nAudio Codec:\t160kbps VBR MP3 stereo (Lame 3.97)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84f8122c9d6df8a9a839e8d6e9ef3e0a5de618b0","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Mark+Twain+%28XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84f8122c9d6df8a9a839e8d6e9ef3e0a5de618b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,248,18,44,157,109,248,169,168,57,232,214,233,239,62,10,93,230,24,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
