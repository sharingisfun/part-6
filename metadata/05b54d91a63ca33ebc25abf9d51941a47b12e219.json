Although the band had a reputation as a mouthpiece for humorist Shel Silverstein, who supplied several of their biggest hits (including &quot;The Cover of Rolling Stone&quot;), they didn't rely exclusively on his material by any means. And, during their peak years, they were just as famed for their crazed stage antics, which ranged from surreal banter to impersonating their own opening acts. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Sylvia's Mother\n02.Queen Of The Silver Dollar\n03.Marie Lavaux\n04.Cover Of The Rolling Stone\n05.The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan\n06.Hey Lady Godiva\n07.Four Years Older Than Me\n08.Makin' It Natural\n09.Freakin' At The Freaker's Ball\n10.If I'd Only Come And Gone\n11.Carry Me Carrie\n12.Penicillin Penny\n13.Life Ain't Easy\n14.Roland The Roadie And Gertrude The Groupie\n15.Acapulco Goldie\n16.When Lilly Was Queen\n17.Monterey Jack\n18.You Ain't Got The Right\n19.Sing Me A Rainbow\n20.Kiss It Away\n21.When She Cries\n22.Judy\n23.I Call That True Love\n24.Mama, I'll Sing One Song For You\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b54d91a63ca33ebc25abf9d51941a47b12e219","amp;dn":"Dr.+Hook+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b54d91a63ca33ebc25abf9d51941a47b12e219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,181,77,145,166,60,163,62,188,37,171,249,213,25,65,164,123,18,226,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
