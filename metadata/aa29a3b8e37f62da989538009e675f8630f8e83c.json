It runs on the Raspberry Pi hardware and runs the latest (as of this writing) version of Raspbian OS. \n\nThanks goes out to the Raspberry Pi foundation as well as the HomePass community for their work and continued support and progress in helping people the world over complete these damned 3D Puzzles.\n\n-Update-  With NintendoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent change to their relay network, the SpillPass Pi now offers 12 streetpasses ~every 10 minutes. That is enough streetpassing to keep you playing all the Mii Plaza games in rotation forever without breaks (with the current MAC list and timing structure, this device will never overlap into the 8-hour cool-down period)\n\n-Update-  The most common problem people have been experiencing is no streetpassing on initial bootup. Please check to make sure that your OLD WiFi settings in your 3DS/2DS (your normal routerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SSID) have been deleted. If your old routerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s config is still in your 3DS, it will ignore the SpillPass as it treats the WiFi profiles with priority over Nintendo Hotspots.\n\n\nIncluded with this documentation file is the SpillPassPi image. It was created and can be written back with Win32 Disk Imager or dd.\n\nFull setup instructions and hardware list at &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.SpillMonkey.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.SpillMonkey.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run advertising on my site, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go looking for donations. All I ask if that if you are going to purchase this hardware via amazon anyway, that you consider buying it through my site. It costs exactly the same to you, and any proceeds I receive will go towards hosting the site. If proceeds ever go above my hosting costs, I will donate these back to the Raspberry Pi foundation charity. It is also a good way to make sure you pick up the right WiFi adapter :)\n--\n\nSSH is open by default for the root user\nPlease use    root  /  SpillPassPi   to authenticate\nMinimal WebGui runs on port 80\nRunning Raspbian OS (based on debain) all terms apply\n\n-Note- Because the device is in rotation mode, there is a brief drop and pickup in WiFi service that some games cannot handle. It is recommended that you connect to your normal WiFi while you play these games online. I may add an option to disable/enable Mac Rotation from the WebGUI at a later time to assist with this.\n\n\n\n Change log:\n\nVersion 0.1  -  Success! Found the cheapest and most readily available wifi chipset that supports what we need to do.  Let the testing begin.\n\nVersion 0.5 - First successful streetpass via a single statically assigned mac. Working off router's DHCP without opening any ports.\n\nVersion 0.6 - Tinkering with Semperverus's rotational script. Modified, but used as primary learning source. Ty Semperverus.\n\nVersion 0.8 - First successful rotating streetpass.\n\nVersion 1.0 - First fully automated streetpass rotation from boot. Setup hostapd session in a named screen that takes over the primary monitor session on load. Displays IP and information.\n\nVersion 1.1 - Began very simple WebGUI interface.\n\nVersion 1.2 - Minor tweaks for faster boot and stability.\n\nVersion 1.3 - Just because.\n\nVersion 1.313 - Reboot and Shutdown implemented in webGUI\n\nVersion 1.5 - First Release\n\nVersion 1.6 - Added some auto-recovery if things go wrong internally. Rotation speed has also been shortened and better staggered.\n\n\n\n\nThis device and it's software come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nNintendo may at any point in time decide to completely change their relay communication methods.\nIf that ever becomes the case, enjoy your new re-purposable Raspberry Pi :)\nThis device and it's creators are in no way affiliated with nor endorsed by the wonderful people at Nintendo.\nThough there is no official support channel, I am often found in #3DS on Efnet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa29a3b8e37f62da989538009e675f8630f8e83c","amp;dn":"Unlimited+Streetpasses+for+your+Nintendo+3DS+or+2DS+at+home+with","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa29a3b8e37f62da989538009e675f8630f8e83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,41,163,184,227,127,98,218,152,149,56,0,158,103,95,134,48,248,232,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
