This book takes a look at those challengesÃ¢â‚¬â€the logos that have truly pushed a designer's creativity and forced him or her to reach inside.\n\nThe authors examine 180 logos, making it easy for designers to take away insightful tips they can put to work immediately. The author tracks the life cycle of each logo from its challenge through the process to the final result. Scattered throughout the book are sidebars featuring 15 logos that were made over. The author talks about why the makeover was needed and, with the before and after logos side by side, discusses if the re-do was successful.\n\nColor images throughout that show the logos from conceptual stages to final art make this book an at-a-glance reference for anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€designer or entrepreneurÃ¢â‚¬â€who wants to take an active role in the creation of his or her brand mark.\n\n\nPDF format / 184 pages in total\nLanguage - English\n\n\nPlease SEED\nLong Live Pirate Bay!\n\n\nPeace to all ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280c37aee99a58dea96a4e2f3a46b90b6cce5ec5","amp;dn":"Logos+-+Making+a+Strong+Mark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280c37aee99a58dea96a4e2f3a46b90b6cce5ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,12,55,174,233,154,88,222,169,106,78,47,58,70,185,11,108,206,94,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
