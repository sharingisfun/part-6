It develops a method for communicating proofs, categorizing, identifying, and explaining (at the student's level) the various techniques that are used repeatedly in virtually all proofs. These clear, concise explanations promote understanding of the theoretical mathematics behind abstract mathematics and give students a greater opportunity to succeed in advanced courses.\n\nAlong with the addition of three new chapters, a &quot;Part 2&quot; is added to the Sixth Edition, which focuses on the mathematical thought processes associated with proofs.\n\nThe teaching of this foregoing thinking processes reduces the time needed for readers to learn advanced mathematics courses while simultaneously increasing their depth of understanding so as to enable them to use mathematics more effectively as a problem-solving tool in their personal and professional lives.\n\nContents\n========\n\nPart I: Proofs\n\n   1  The Truth of It All\n   2  The Forward-Backward Method\n   3  On Definitions and Mathematical Terminology\n   4  Quantifiers I: The Construction Method\n   5  Quantifiers II: The Choose Method\n   6  Quantifiers III: Specialization\n   7  Quantifiers IV: Nested Quantifiers\n   8  Nots of Nots Lead to Knots\n   9  The Contradiction Method\n  10  The Contrapositive Method\n  11  The Uniqueness Methods\n  12  Induction\n  13  The Either/Or Methods\n  14  The Max/Min Methods\n  15  Summary\n\nPart II: Other Mathematical Thinking Processes\n\n  16  Generalization\n  17  Creating Mathematical Definitions\n  18  Axiomatic Systems\n\n  Appendix A Examples of Proofs from Discrete Mathematics\n  Appendix B Examples of Proofs from Linear Algebra\n  Appendix C Examples of Proofs from Modern Algebra\n  Appendix D Examples of Proofs from Real Analysis\n  Solutions to Selected Exercises\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04138c9aaa0848175a2d7979edd6d89929a5ba63","amp;dn":"Daniel+Solow+-+How+to+Read+and+Do+Proofs+%286e%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04138c9aaa0848175a2d7979edd6d89929a5ba63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,19,140,154,170,8,72,23,90,45,121,121,237,214,216,153,41,165,186,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
