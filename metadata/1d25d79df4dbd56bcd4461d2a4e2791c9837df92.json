Since the albums were a success, it gave him the opportunity to make Sacred Island, a collection of Hawaiian music and Hawaiian-flavored blues. Even though there are a couple of weak moments, it works better than you might think, since Taj Mahal has never been a blues purist. As a result, it's an interesting detour that longtime fans will find fascinating. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d25d79df4dbd56bcd4461d2a4e2791c9837df92","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Taj+Mahal+%26+The+Hula+Blues+Band+-+Sacred+Island","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d25d79df4dbd56bcd4461d2a4e2791c9837df92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,37,215,157,244,219,213,107,205,68,97,210,164,226,121,28,152,55,223,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
