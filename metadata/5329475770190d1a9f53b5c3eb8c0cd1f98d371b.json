Weighed down by toxic thoughts and emotions, we might be quick to judge and slow to pardon, and self-righteous about our feelings as we dwell on memories of what we or others did (or failed to do). In this new book and CD, Iyanla Vanzant challenges us to liberate ourselves from the wounds of the past and to embrace the new power of forgiveness.\nWith IyanlaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 21-Day Forgiveness Plan, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore relationship dynamics with your parents, children, friends, partners, co-workers, bosses, yourself, and even God. With journaling work and Emotional Freedom Techniques (also known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“tappingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to live with more love; gain new clarity on your life, lessons, and blessings; and discover a new level of personal freedom, peace, and well-being.\nForgiveness doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean agreeing with, condoning, or even liking what has happened. Forgiveness means letting go and knowing thatÃ¢â‚¬â€regardless of how challenging, frightening, or difficult an experience may seemÃ¢â‚¬â€everything is just as it needs to be in order for you to grow and learn. When you focus on how things Ã¢â‚¬Å“shouldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ be, you deny the presence and power of love. Accept the events of the past, while being willing to change your perspective on them. As Iyanla says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only forgiveness can liberate minds and hearts once held captive by anger, bitterness, resentment, and fear. Forgiveness is a true path to freedom that can renew faith, build trust, and nourish the soul.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 160 pages\nPublisher: Smiley Books; Har/Com edition (December 3, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1401943616\nISBN-13: 978-1401943615\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5329475770190d1a9f53b5c3eb8c0cd1f98d371b","amp;dn":"Forgiveness%3A+21+Days+to+Forgive+Everyone+for+Everything+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5329475770190d1a9f53b5c3eb8c0cd1f98d371b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,41,71,87,112,25,13,26,159,83,181,195,235,140,12,209,249,141,55,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
