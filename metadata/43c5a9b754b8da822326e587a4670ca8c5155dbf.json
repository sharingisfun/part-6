Since the beginning, there has been a wide range of influences, transcending forms, styles, and genresÃ¢â‚¬Â¦running the gamut from early Fates Warning and QueensrÃƒÂ¿che to Coroner and Holy Terror, from Kitaro and Klaus Schulze to Black Sabbath, Rush, and King CrimsonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦all the while incorporating elements from 4AD artists/shoegazers (Dead Can Dance, This Mortal Coil, etc.) and a decidedly neo-romantic structure inspired by the likes of Chopin, Beethoven, Faure - as well as some late 20th Century composers such as Gorecki, PÃƒÂ¤rt, and Kilar.\n\nDespite countless line-up changes in the early years, the core of the band, featuring bassist Jim Hunter, guitarist Scott Loose, and his sister Michelle on keyboards essentially came together in 1998 and has remained intact ever since, though her husband and Brave bandmate Trevor came on board in 2004 after a series of drummers came and went.\n\nThe current line-up really solidified in 2008 with the addition of former Altura vocalist Rain Irving, who first appeared on the landmark Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vast Oceans LachrymoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album, which ultimately has come to define the full realization of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“WHW soundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ without betraying the musical framework established over the decades prior. Shortly after the release of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vast Oceans LachrymoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the line-up was further expanded when one-time surrogate keyboard player Jason Lingle (also ex-Altura) was brought in to enhance the orchestral and harmonic aspects of the material.\n\nAfter more than 20 years operating as an independent artist, self-financing every release and tour, the band signed their first and only contract with the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest Metal label Nuclear Blast Records in 2010 to combat the exorbitant prices for their rare catalog of releases and to insure their music was widely available from then on.\n\nFollowing the release of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fear Of InfinityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album in 2011, WHW toured throughout Europe and the United States, performed at several high-profile festivals including GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hammer Of Doom, GreeceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Up The Hammers, ProgPower USA, as well as a series of European Metalfests promoted by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s booking agency Rock The Nation.\n\nOver the past 25 years, WHW has shared the stage with everyone from legends such as Saint Vitus, Trouble, Pentagram, Forbidden, and Sanctuary to equally legendary contemporaries like Primordial, Solstice (UK), Mourning Beloveth, Penance, and Revelation onto new hopes like Orodruin, Argus, The Gates Of Slumber, Alcest, Cormorant, and VektorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦not to mention sharing festival stages with the likes of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“larger than lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Arch Enemy, Sabaton, Amon Amarth, Cradle Of Filth, etc.\n\n2014 marks a quarter of a century of While Heaven Wept and the band is commemorating this with the release of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suspended At AphelionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - a single 40 minute epic, that is easily the pinnacle of their recorded output so farÃ¢â‚¬Â¦combining the sweeping melodies, dense orchestration, glorious bombast, and heartfelt sincerity theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always been known for in their most Ã¢â‚¬Å“completeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ expression to date.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Suspended At AphelionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sees the band continuing to redefine themselves defying musical labels and boundaries with their most ambitious, truly progressive release to date. Apart from the panoramic scope of the material, the involvement of prestigious guests including Fates Warning co-founder Victor Arduini, Fates Warning alumnus and Warlord drummer Mark Zonder, esteemed classical guitarist Christopher Ladd, and cellist Mark Shuping further pushes the album unto another level altogether.\n\n25 years on, we find While Heaven Wept at the very peak of their creativity and profoundly emotional expression, not content to revel in past glories or rest upon laurels, it seems that this is only the beginningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nCode\nCurrent members:\n\nTom Phillips (ex-Solstice, ex-Twisted Tower Dire, ex-Brave) - vocals, guitars, keyboards\n\nJim Hunter (Twisted Tower Dire, October 31, Revelation) - bass\n\nScott Loose (Brave, Human Theory) - guitars\n\nTrevor Schrotz (Brave) - drums\n\nMichelle Schrotz (Brave) - keyboards, vocals\n\nRain Irving (Altura) - vocals\n\nJason Lingle (Altura) - keyboards, vocals\n\n\nPast memebers:\n\n\nJason Gray (ex-Forty Days Longing) - drums\nAngelo Tringali (Slough Feg) - guitars (live)\nFred Provoost (ex-Whispering Gallery) - keyboards (live)\nJon Paquin - drums\nScott Waldrop (Twisted Tower Dire) - guitars\nJim Murad (ex-Twisted Tower Dire) - bass\nWiley Wells (Novembers Doom, Those Are They) - keyboards\nDanny Ingerson (ex-Dysrhythmia (band)) - bass\nKevin Hufnagel (Dysrhythmia (band), Gorguts) - guitar\nGabe Funston - bass\nPhil Bloxam - (ex-Hellion - DC underground metal band) - drums\nJake Bodnar - keyboards\nKenny Thomas - guitars, vocals\n&quot;Diamond&quot; Dave - bass\nJames Whorton - drums\nJason Stone - bass\nDavid Bornhauser - guitars\nTony Garcia - guitars\nChad Peevy - bass\nBrendan &quot;Ber&quot; Galvan - vocals\nChris Galvan - guitars\nJim Chappell - drums\n\nWhile Heaven Wept - Suspended At Aphelion\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
