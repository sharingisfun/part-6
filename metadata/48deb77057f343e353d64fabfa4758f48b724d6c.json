After holding research positions at Karlsruhe and New York he worked 12 years at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, USA. In 1974 he accepted a professorship at the University of TÃƒÂ¼bingen. For his scientific achievements Rudolf Huebener was awarded the Max Planck Research Prize in 1992.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (10 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319091409\nISBN-13: 978-3319091402","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48deb77057f343e353d64fabfa4758f48b724d6c","amp;dn":"Conductors%2C+Semiconductors%2C+Superconductors+%3A+An+Introduction+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48deb77057f343e353d64fabfa4758f48b724d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,222,183,112,87,243,67,227,83,214,79,171,250,71,88,244,139,114,77,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
