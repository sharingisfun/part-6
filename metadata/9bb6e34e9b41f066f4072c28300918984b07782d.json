This absorbing DVD collection, Decisive Battles of the Ancient World, offers the ultimate survey of the colossal conflicts that determined the fate of the Western world.\n&quot; Revisit the exploits of Hannibal, Spartacus, Attila the Hun and many others.\n&quot; Detailed re-enactments bring these pivotal events to life.\n&quot; Military historians, archaeologists and other experts share their insights.\n\n\n1)  The Gothic Invasion of Rome \nCorruption drove the hungry horde of Visigoths to rebel against Rome and pride drove the Emperor Valens, heading a fractured Roman Empire, to take them on without support\n\n2)  Hail Caesar \nOf all Rome's many battles, perhaps the most important was internal. When Julius Caesar went head-to-head, with Gnaeus Pompey, the outcome would change the fate of the Western world\n\n3)  Herman the German \nThe patrician leader Arminius, or Herman the German, was at the helm of one of the darkest ambushes in the history of Rome, dispelling the aura of invincibility that had long marched ahead of the vaunted legions.\n\n4)  Marathon \nthe first great invasion of the Persian Empire was not thwarted by the Spartans, but by the Athenians. In a heroic effort, the hoplite warriors of the city-state triumphed in a fight against both greater numbers and the march of time.\n\n5)  Ramses II \n- As one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs, Rames II confronted the biggest menace to his reign as the Hittite Wing Muwwitallah threatened to break away from the hegemony of the Egyptian empire.\n\n6)  Spartacus \nSpartacus has long been one of the most famous figures of the ancient world. A Thracian gladiator with a gift for leadership, he led a huge revolt against Rome at the height of its power\n\n7)  Thermopylae \n- In one of history's greatest displays of military heroism, 300 Spartans outside Thermopylae held off the vengeful Persians until the last Spartan had been killed.\n\n8)  Attila the Hun \nNo ruler in history represents the barbarian brutality as much as Attila the Hun, who swept through 5th-century Europe and emerged holding its future in his grasp.\n\n9)  The Birth of the Roman Empire \nIn a classic military conflict between two Ancient World superpowers, the great Macedonian phalanx clashed mightily against the heavily fortified Roman legion.\n\n10)  Boudicca Warrior Queen \nIn the farthest flung province of the Roman Empire - Britain - a warrior queen named Boudicca rose in revolt.\n\n11)  Cannae \nIn a classic example of double-envelopment manoeuvre, an under-fortified Hannibal inflicted the greatest ever defeat on the forces of Rome, who marched eight legions strong into their surprising defeat\n\n12)  Crassus Rich Man Poor Man \nAlthough he may have been the richest man in Rome, Crassus was the poor relation in the First Triumvirate. He needed military laurels to raise him to the vanity cost the lives of seven legions, his son and his own.\n\n13)  Gaugamela \nGaugamela was the greatest battle fought by Alexander the Great and it gave him control of the Persian Empire. Darius raised a titanic army against Alexander and picked the ideal spot for his cavalry-led force, but it was not enough\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/9135/decisivebattlesoftheanc.jpg&quot;
