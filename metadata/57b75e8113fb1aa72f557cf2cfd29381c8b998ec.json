The upperclassmen are hazing the incoming freshmen, and everyone is trying to get stoned, drunk, or laid, even the football players that signed a pledge not to.\n\nIn a small Texas enclave, highlights the rites of passage on the last day of school in 1976 for the new, incoming freshmen at the hands of the class of 77 at Robert E. Lee High School. Freshman boys are physically punished, while the girls largely face the brunt of verbal abuse and humiliation. Two main figures emerge. Incoming freshman Mitch Kramer comes to a new realization in his role as a major target of senior hazing. And, among the seniors is Randall Pink Floyd, the schools star quarterback, who moves with facile grace among groups of greasers, nerds, stoners, and athletes alike.\n\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57b75e8113fb1aa72f557cf2cfd29381c8b998ec","amp;dn":"Dazed+and+Confused","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57b75e8113fb1aa72f557cf2cfd29381c8b998ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,183,94,129,19,251,26,167,47,85,124,242,207,210,147,129,200,185,152,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
