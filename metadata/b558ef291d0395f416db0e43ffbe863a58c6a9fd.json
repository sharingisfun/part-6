This book covers both the medical and cosmetic aspects of these skin disorders including all clinical considerations, etiology, epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and the latest theories on pathophysiology.\n\nSeveral chapters address the most current medical therapeutics and laser treatments available for each of the conditions. In the case of acne, an entire chapter is dedicated to the treatment of acne scarring.\n\nThe book is illustrated with over 70 color photographs. It is invaluable to physicians in practice and training, including dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and general physicians, and to any healthcare personnel involved in the administration of laser and light-based therapies for acne and rosacea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b558ef291d0395f416db0e43ffbe863a58c6a9fd","amp;dn":"Acne+and+Rosacea%2C+Epidemiology%2C+Diagnosis+and+Treatment+%5BPDF%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b558ef291d0395f416db0e43ffbe863a58c6a9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,88,239,41,29,3,149,244,22,219,14,67,255,190,134,58,88,198,169,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
