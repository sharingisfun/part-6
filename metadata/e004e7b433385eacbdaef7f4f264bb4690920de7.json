She starred in the popular sitcom Ellen from 1994 to 1998 and has hosted the syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show since 2003\n\nMy Point...And I Do Have One\nIn this #1 New York Times bestseller, Ellen DeGeneres shares her hilarious take on everything from our most baffling human foiblesÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding how we behave in elevators, airplanes, and restrooms, and why weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re so scared of the boogeymanÃ¢â‚¬â€œto fashion trends, celebrity, and her secret recipe for EllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Real Frenchy French Toast. Most of all, this witty, engaging book offers insights into the mind of one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved comics.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDear Reader,\nI was awfully excited when I was asked to write a book. I was however, nervous. I was afraid I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have anything important to say. But when I began writing, I realized that although I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know a lot about any one thing, I know a little about a whole bunch of things: baking a pie; dancing; curing the common cold; running the IditarodÃ¢â‚¬â€œitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all in the book. And I realized I notice things that maybe some people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice (or they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice). ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all in the book, too.\n\nSeriously...I'm Kidding\nI've experienced a whole lot the last few years and I have a lot to share. So I hope that you'll take a moment to sit back, relax and enjoy the words I've put together for you in this book. I think you'll find I've left no stone unturned, no door unopened, no window unbroken, no rug unvacuumed, no ivories untickled. What I'm saying is, let us begin, shall we?\n\nThe Funny Thing Is...\nEllen DeGeneres published her first book of comic essays, the #1 bestselling My Point...and I Do Have One, way back in 1996. Not one to rest on her laurels, the witty star of stage and screen has since dedicated her life to writing a hilarious new book. That book is this book. After years of painstaking, round-the-clock research, surviving on a mere twenty minutes of sleep a night, and collaborating with lexicographers, plumbers, and mathematicians, DeGeneres has crafted a book that is both easy to use and very funny. Along with her trademark ramblings, The Funny Thing Is...contains hundreds of succinct insights into her psyche, supplemented by easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and diagrams so that you'll never miss a joke. Overseeing all aspects of production, DeGeneres labored over details both significant and insignificant, including typefaces, page number placement, and which of the thousands of world languages to use. Ultimately she selected English, as it's her mother tongue, but translations into Hindi and Pig Latin are already in the works. DeGeneres takes an innovative approach to the organization of her book by utilizing a section in the beginning that includes the name of each chapter, along with a corresponding page number. She calls it the &quot;Table of Contents,&quot; and she is confident that it will become the standard to which all books in the future will aspire. Some of the other innovative features you'll find in this edition: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ More than 50,000 simple, short words arranged in sentences that form paragraphs. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Thousands of observations on everyday life -- from terrible fashion trends to how to handle seating arrangements for a Sunday brunch with Paula Abdul, Diane Sawyer, and Eminem. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Sure to make you laugh, The Funny Thing Is...is an indispensable reference for anyone who knows how to read or wants to fool people into thinking they do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e004e7b433385eacbdaef7f4f264bb4690920de7","amp;dn":"3+Books+by+Ellen+Degeneres+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e004e7b433385eacbdaef7f4f264bb4690920de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,4,231,180,51,56,94,172,189,174,247,244,242,100,187,70,144,146,13,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
