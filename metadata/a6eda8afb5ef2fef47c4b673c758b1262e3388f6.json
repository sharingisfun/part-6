AUTHOR: At the age of six, Gary Takle demonstrated his love for built form by designing and constructing his first cubby house. With each proceeding year, Gary's appreciation for the good design of anything house and home grew. Combined with a history in the publishing industry, it saw him champion Think Publishing and consequently create numerous architectural, interior and garden titles. With a focus on modern spaces, these books include Best Contemporary Country Houses, Houses for Small Spaces, 100 Australian gardens and Landscapes and Australia's Best Houses. Gary enjoys his passion for design and hence devotes much of his time to sourcing leading-edge projects for inclusion in his many titles. It is Gary's keen understanding of what is required to create a home and garden to serve our modern lifestyle that has been the securer of his success in the industry. colour throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6eda8afb5ef2fef47c4b673c758b1262e3388f6","amp;dn":"Britain%27s+Best+Architecture+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6eda8afb5ef2fef47c4b673c758b1262e3388f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,237,168,175,181,239,47,239,71,196,182,115,199,88,177,38,46,51,136,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
