The gunÃ¢â‚¬â€which evades all licensing requirements and has no serial number to trackÃ¢â‚¬â€was a deadly threat that made headlines around the world for the danger it posed to gun control laws. Technology journalist Kyle Chayka draws on conversations over the past two years with Wilson to tell the full story of the 3D-printed Liberator gun. An introduction to 3D printing technology as well as a gripping, dramatic tale, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Printed GunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is required reading for life in our ever-changing technological landscape. \n\nAbout the Author:\nKyle Chayka is a technology and culture journalist living in Brooklyn who has contributed to The New Yorker, The New Republic, The Atlantic, and other publications, where he has covered topics ranging from legalized marijuana to digital currencies.
