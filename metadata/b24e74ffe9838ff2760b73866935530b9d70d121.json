But Fairport had then lost arguably its\ntwo most important contributors, founder and direction-setter Ashley Hutchings and crystal-voiced\nfrontwoman Sandy Denny. New bassist Dave Pegg proved a valuable acquisition with his rocky style,\nbut the other members had to close ranks and take on the vocal chores themselves. They did so,\nwith an initial naÃƒÂ¯vitÃƒÂ© that retrospectively evinces considerable charm, Richard Thompson and Dave\nSwarbrick proving to have distinctively different rural vocal deliveries and Simon Nicol reluctantly\nairing a melodious tenor that would eventually see him become the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading voice.\nThe other element that newly marks Full House out is the humour and looseness which its illustrious\npredecessor lacked. With talented but earnest female vocalist Denny no longer having to be\naccommodated and adulated, the boys were free to have some fun, and it comes across in these\ngrooves, notwithstanding the doomy themes of some of the lyrics: songs about sexual exploitation,\nsin and death can be funky, as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doctor Of PhysickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sir Patrick SpensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show. I recall\nseeing this line-up play the Bath Festival Of Blues And Progressive Music at Shepton Mallet in 1970,\nand the high jinks on stage would not have been on display a year earlier.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Walk AwhileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a wonderfully swinging opener, with all three lead vocalists taking turns at the\nverses and fine, fiery harmony and octave work between ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar and SwarbrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nviolin. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an ominous, downbeat death march that builds to an almost unbearable tension in\nthe lengthy instrumental break as ThommoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s edgy Strat and SwarbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compressed, wailing fiddle duke\nit out in opposite stereo channels: perhaps the best instrumental work the band ever produced. The\ntwo cheerful jig medleys offer a variety of familiar and little-known traditional tunes, forefronting\nSwarbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and PeggyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duelling mandolins on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flatback CaperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and all four string players on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirty\nLinenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a gloriously disrespectful, steady-rollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ take on that revered Scottish traditional\nditty, while NicolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amplified dulcimer provides the backbone for that countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mournful anthem\nfor the dead, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flowers Of The ForestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The Island CD re-release offers a number of bonus tracks,\nincluding the unnecessarily lugubrious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poor Will &amp; The Jolly HangmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that had been removed\n(probably wisely) from the original pressing at the last moment at the insistence of its writer,\nThompson, and the brief but excellent non-album single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now Be ThankfulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, one of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nevergreens.\nFull House is arguably FairportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last really great album, its release being followed by the departure\nof Thompson for a solo career and his replacement by Jerry Donohue, whose elegant Nashville style\nprefaced a gentle slide in the direction of country rock. Henceforth Swarbrick would take over the\nbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s direction as the quality gradually declined until his own departure, when Nicol as the last-\nstanding original member would take the reins. After countless further line-up changes and albums\nthe band remains extant and much-loved to this day, with its annual outdoor reunion at Cropredy in\nOxfordshire attracting swarms of the faithful.\nReview by Len\nRate 4.5/5.0\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.Walk Awhile (4:02)\n02.Doctor Of Physick (3:34)\n03.Dirty Linen (4:14)\n04.Sloth (9:15)\n05.Sir Patrick Spens (3:32)\n06.Flatback Caper (6:22)\n07.Poor Will &amp; The Jolly Hangman (5:32)\n08.Flowers Of The Forest (4:04)\n09.Now Be Thankful (Mono) (2:24)\n10.Sir B.
