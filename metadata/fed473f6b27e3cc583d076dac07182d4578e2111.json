Windows 7 Starter is only available in a 32-bit version. The Windows Aero theme is not included in this version. The desktop wallpaper and Visual Styles (Windows 7 Basic) are not user-changeable. Microsoft originally intended to restrict the edition to running 3 simultaneous applications but this limitation was dropped.[6]\nThis edition is available pre-installed on computers, especially netbooks, through system integrators or computer manufacturers using OEM licenses.[1][7][8]\nWindows 7 Home Basic\nWindows 7 Home Basic is available in &quot;emerging markets&quot;, in 141 different countries.[9] Some Windows Aero options are excluded along with several new features.[1] Home Basic, along with other editions sold in emerging markets, include geographical activation restriction, which requires users to activate Windows within a certain region or country.[10]\nWindows 7 Home Premium\nThis edition contains features aimed at the home market segment, such as Windows Media Center, Windows Aero and multi-touch support.[11]\nWindows 7 Professional\nThis edition is targeted towards enthusiasts and small-business users.[1] It includes all the features of Windows 7 Home Premium, and adds the ability to participate in a Windows Server domain.[1] Additional features include operating as a Remote Desktop server, location aware printing, Encrypting File System, Presentation Mode, Software Restriction Policies (but not the extra management features of AppLocker) and Windows XP Mode.[1] Like Enterprise, Microsoft will support this edition until 2020.\nWindows 7 Enterprise\nThis edition targets the enterprise segment of the market and is sold through volume licensing to companies which have a Software Assurance contract with Microsoft.[1] Additional features include support for Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packages, BitLocker Drive Encryption, and UNIX application support.[1] Not available through retail or OEM channels, this edition is distributed through Microsoft Software Assurance (SA).[1] As a result it includes several SA-only benefits, including a license allowing the operating of diskless nodes (diskless PCs), the running of multiple virtual machines, and activation via VLK.[12] Like Professional, Microsoft will support this edition until 2020.\nWindows 7 Ultimate\nWindows 7 Ultimate contains all of the same features as Windows 7 Enterprise, but unlike the Enterprise edition, it is available to home users on an individual license basis.[1] Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional users are able to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate for a fee using Windows Anytime Upgrade if they wish to do so.[1] Unlike Windows Vista Ultimate, the Windows 7 Ultimate edition does not include the Windows Ultimate Extras feature or any exclusive features as Microsoft had stated.[1] However, even though it is the consumer equivalent to Enterprise, like Home Premium, Microsoft will only support Ultimate until 2015\nI took Some Snapshots while i was installing it on My Virtual Machine:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/6140/frm00001v.jpg&quot;
