He's been playing the music for years, and just seems to keep getting better.\nBenoit co-wrote seven of the 11 tracks here with his co-producer, Anders Osborne, who also share some guitar duties. But the result is all framed by Benoit's tough, gritty vocals and sharply focused guitar.\nThe title track, which actually leads off the album, is a deep and dark tribute to music as the medicine that heals the soul. Benoit's guitar crackles around the growling lyrics, and sets the tone for everything that follows. And what follows is an outstanding set of finely crafted songs sung with considerable passion, perfectly played by a tight band that powers the groove effortlessly beneath each song; always crisp, never interfering.\nThis is one of those albums without a false note or a throwaway track --  a musical gem from the roots of some of America's finest music. Enjoy it.[/color]\n\nTracklist:\n01. Medicine\n02. Sunrise\n03. A Whole Lotta Soul\n04. Come And Get It\n05. Broke And Lonely\n06. Long Lonely Bayou\n07. In It To Win It\n08. Can't You See\n09.
