In a wide-ranging book encompassing social history, language, music, politics, the natural world and much more, we discover the truth behind some of our most cherished beliefs.\n\nWe can all remember the stories we were told as children:\nSanta Claus lives at the North Pole;\nSt Bernard dogs carry brandy to help lost climbers;\nLady Godiva rode naked through Coventry.\nThey were great stories Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and we believed them.\n\nBut are they true?\n\nMax Cryer sets out to investigate the truth or otherwise of ideas and beliefs we may have always been told are true, but which on closer examination may not be. For example:\nDid Winston Churchill coin the term Ã¢â‚¬ËœIron CurtainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢?\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœOKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an American expression, right?\nTulips come from Holland, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they?\nDid Sarah Palin say, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI can see Russia from my house?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nThe subjects covered in this highly entertaining book are diverse, ranging from politics, science and social history, to language, music and the natural world. Max Cryer approaches each with an open mind, seeking to uncover the truth behind some of our most cherished beliefs. Be prepared for surprises.\n\nMax Cryer has many yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experience of researching and writing on aspects of language and social history. A well-known broadcaster and entertainer, he hosts a weekly radio show on the English language. In a long career, he has been a schoolteacher, a compere and television host, as well as a performer on the opera stage in London and in cabaret in Las Vegas and Hollywood.
