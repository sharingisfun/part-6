India, XVI-th century. The little girl Maya, the daughter of a dancer, lives in the palace of the Maharajah. She was allowed to continue wearing the old clothes of Princess Tara, attend dance classes and lectures about the love of the ancient Kama Sutra book. Years pass, and the girls are lovely girls, the princess Tara woos a handsome prince Raj Singh. But under the hot sun of India love does not recognize caste distinctions. One rival is the title and power, and the other only the beauty and unsurpassed art of seduction. How will this exquisite and brutal fight?\n\nThis film can turn the traditional view of Indian cinema. Established filmmakers from India and Germany, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; iron combines the principles of art-cinema and an eastern sensibility. This subtly sophisticated story of love between a courtesan and sculptor Maya Jay takes place in the luxurious interiors of an Indian palace of the XVI century. Sex scenes are shown with great taste and often stylized as classical Indian stories.\n\nReleased: 1996\nIssued: India, Germany, USA, Japan, United Kingdom\nLanguage: 1:54:14\nTranslation: Russian + English\nSubtitles: French, Spanish (external *. srt)\nGenre: historical, crime, romance, erotica, drama\n\nQuality: DVDRip\nVideo: XviD, 720x544, 2140 kb / s\nAudio: Russian  AC3, 2ch, 192.00 kb / s\nAudio: English  AC3, 2ch, 192.00 kb / s\nSound: English comment  AC3, 2ch, 192.00 kb / s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e2e5311646fa94fd07a1b7f775ed3cdd7c090b7","amp;dn":"Kama+Sutra%3A+A+Tale+of+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e2e5311646fa94fd07a1b7f775ed3cdd7c090b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,46,83,17,100,111,169,79,208,122,27,127,119,94,211,205,215,192,144,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
