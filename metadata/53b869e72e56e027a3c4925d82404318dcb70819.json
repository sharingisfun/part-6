Windows 10 (a free update to users of Windows 8 or Windows 7) fixes a number of the problems introduced by the revolution in Windows 8 and offers plenty of new features along, such as the new Spartan web browser, Cortana voice-activated â€œpersonal assistant,â€ new universal apps (that run on tablet, phone, and computer), and more.
