Everyone discovers Robin was a Canadian teen pop star known as Robin Sparkles in the early 90s, with a hit single \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Go To The Mall\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; leading Barney to lose a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;slap bet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, which permits Marshall to slap him in the face five times at any given time in the future, whenever Marshall chooses, which he does twice during this season. It is revealed that Barney has a gay, black brother called James (Wayne Brady).Also, Barney reveals that Bob Barker is his father, but in truth, his mother had pointed out Bob Barker as Barney\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s father while watching The Price is Right, but Barney takes a trip to California to be a contestant on TPIR anyway.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage.
