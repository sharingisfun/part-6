Craving a follow-up to the breathy, interstellar soul of &quot;Destiny&quot; from the group&amp;#039;s debut disc, or &quot;Passing By&quot; from When It Falls? You may struggle to find similar magic here. Even so, The Garden is an intriguing listen, showcasing the sophistication that makes Zero 7 the Steely Dan of chillout--wry, intelligent lyrical observations, inventive musicianship, a detached sense of cool forged by the duo&amp;#039;s heady blend of folk, jazz, &amp;#039;70s soul, and electronica. The Kraftwerk-like &quot;Seeing Things&quot;--the disc&amp;#039;s lone instrumental--and the pulsing &quot;You&amp;#039;re My Flame&quot; are useful tracks to gauge this album&amp;#039;s elevated vibrancy. Sia Furler is the group&amp;#039;s only returning vocalist, and the absence of Sophie Barker and Tina Dico, the gentle Christine McVie counterpoints to Furler&amp;#039;s rough-hewn Stevie Nicks, is noticeable. Mozez and his Seal-like soul is also gone, replaced by more folk/pop-oriented JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£lez. Binns even spends 80 seconds as the quiet lead voice on the slow-building brass outburst &quot;Your Place.&quot; Furler&amp;#039;s up-and-down vocals on &quot;The Pageant of the Bizarre&quot; will stick in your mind, but her best work comes on two clever lampoons of pampered lifestyles, &quot;This Fine Social Scene&quot; and &quot;Waiting to Die.&quot; (Sample lyric: &quot;Now is a good time for tasty glass of wine; let&amp;#039;s not worry ourselves about carbon dioxide.&quot;) Different, yes, but worthwhile.\n\nTracklist:\n\n 1.
