There, she draws the ire of Mini, the queen bee of her group, caused by a violent hockey game and exacerbated by Mini's dim view of Franky's fashion sense. Franky is approached by best friends Alo and metalhead Rich, who are also outsiders, and hope to befriend her. However, Mini, seeking a new start, pushes them aside and join her with her two friends, Grace and Liv. They invite her into their group, proceed to take Mephedrone and go shopping. However, Mini starts to antagonise Franky, who rejects her materialistic outlook on life, and looks to steal Grace and Liv away. Mini persuades boyfriend Nick to post embarrassing photos of Franky around the college, which leads to Mini and Franky falling out. After meeting the mysterious Matty, who relates to her, Franky draws strength to confront Mini. After doing so at a party, Grace, who had displayed a genuine interest in Franky from the beginning, leaves. Grace, along with Alo and Rich, stops Franky in the street, pushes her into Rich and Alo's van, and take her to a local swimming pool, where they unite as a gang of their own. By tempting Grace away, Franky has caused a split in MiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s group. First appearances of Franky, Alo, Rich, Mini, Nick, Grace, Liv and Matty.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |      |               |                  |\n2 | Rich | Rich Hardbeck | February 3, 2011 |\n\nRich is a heavy metal fan and when he puts his taste in music on at a party, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go down well with the other party goers so Rich and Alo get kicked out. Alo, fed up of Rich getting between him and girls finds Rich a girl to talk to who he calls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe angel of deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Rich talks to her but soon things become awkward. Franky asks Grace to help Rich with his girl problems but Mini and Liv turn up and is not happy to see Franky there. Grace goes to see Rich in disguise and offers to help him but he wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t compromise and ends up insulting her. Later at a pub Rich bumps into Grace who is dressed as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmetal headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ . It becomes clear that Grace likes Rich but he is oblivious to it so he asks out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe angel of deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but she rejects him. He then buys a record and deafens himself. In anger he rips up his Napalm Death tickets and goes to see GraceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dance recital and begins to cry during her performance. Grace has extra Napalm Death tickets so Rich and Grace go together. The next morning Rich gets his hearing back and realises Grace likes him when he receives a text from her. He asks for advice from his dad and confronts Grace about his feelings for her but can't get up the courage to say anything. As Grace walks off with Mini, Liv and Nick she does a sly Rock sign with her hand. Matty is absent from this episode.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |      |                 |                   |\n3 | Mini | Mini McGuinness | February 10, 2011 |\n\nGrace tells Mini that Franky has been helping with the designs for the fashion show. Mini is angry but canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t show it because Professor Blood is there so she makes out Grace is having a breakdown and decides to redesign the collection herself. Grace stands up to Mini and Liv but they just ignore her. Nick asks Mini to come over to his house but Mini makes up excuses. Later Mini, Liv, Nick and Rider go bowling. Mini steals NickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house keys and he thinks he has lost them when they are thrown out but Rider tells them he has a free house and they all end up going there instead. After playing strip games, Liv and Rider end up having sex and Nick thinks itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time that he and Mini should as well. A nervous Mini ends up being sick on Nick so Liv and Nick take her home. While sleeping on MiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bedroom floor Liv and Nick get close and when Mini discovers them sleeping next to each other sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not impressed. With all the stress of the fashion show plus Liv and Nick, Mini faints and is sent home. After crying she slaps fake tan on and bleachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s her hair. At college, Mini throws herself at Nick but heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not interested. At the after party Mini and Liv have a fight and Rich and Grace kiss. Franky comforts Mini but when they both go to have a dance, Mini sees Liv and Nick leaving a cupboard together. Mini then has sex with Nick and he realises sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a virgin. The next morning she wakes up alone and bumps into her mum in the street doing the same thing.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |     |            |                   |\n4 | Liv | Liv Malone | February 17, 2011 |\n\nLiv and Nick have sex in a van behind MiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s back. LivÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mum then leaves her to look after her little sister while she goes on a mystics' retreat. Just after her mum leaves, Mini, Franky, Rich, Alo, Grace and Nick turn up. Mini pretends she canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remember anything from the fashion show and asks Liv to be friends again. Mini also wants to be friends with Franky and everyone else and brings them a bag of weed. Alo announces that they are not leaving until the entire bag is smoked. Liv gets fed up so she goes see her older sister in prison, she then bumps into Matty at the bus station. They then are given some drugs from a man, who was on the run from the police for the possession of class A drugs, and decide to steal from a gas station. They then go to a costume shop and the shop owner sends Matty to try on a suit and attempts to rape Liv. Matty knocks the shop owner out with a fire extinguisher and takes the CCTV tape and money. They then leave in disguise and have sex on the roof of a club. The next day, they return to Liv's house, where the gang is still partying. Liv and Matty burst into Liv's room to find Mini and Nick in her bed. They discover Nick and Matty are brothers, and it is brought out into the open that Liv and Nick slept together. An angry Liv then throws everyone out. She then watches an old video of her and Mini and her sister comes in after being left at the cinema all night. Angry at Liv, her sister smashes a bowl. Liv goes to see her older sister in prison again to talk about their mum but her sister doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to. Liv then finds Matty and drinks a bottle of vodka to prove to him that she trusts him to look after her while she is sick from the alcohol. She wakes up in the garage of his house, where he hid them unbeknown to his family. Liv makes noise, and Nick bursts in, thinking they are robbers. Matty begs Nick for his help in convincing their father to let him come home, and he and Liv part with an understanding between them. The next day, Liv meets up with Mini in an attempt to repair their broken friendship. After learning that Liv downed a bottle of vodka for Matty, Mini asks her to the same for her. Liv does but Mini leaves her to suffer. LivÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mum returns home and says the trip was rubbish but she can't just run off like her dad did. Liv then takes the blame for the broken bowl and then sits next to her little sister at the cinema.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |      |            |                   |\n5 | Nick | Nick Levan | February 24, 2011 |\n\nNick's success on the pitch continues, and Matty has been allowed to re-enter the family home, subject to a contract. It's clear that Matty is on thin ice but, after persuading Professor Blood, he is nevertheless allowed to re-enroll in college, on probation. Matty continues his relationship with Liv, to Nick's clear irritation. While Matty has sex with Liv in their house, Nick visits Mini and massages her, leading to awkward sex. Later the atmosphere between the foursome is rather tense and silent, but Nick introduces Matty to the gang, who take to him almost immediately. Nick's anxiety is once again clear, and shows when he reacts angrily to a comment from his friend Ryder about Matty and Liv, and subsequently creases him with a hard tackle on the field. To cool off he joins the gang at a local for a few drinks, and with a tense atmosphere building with himself, Liv and Mini, he gets the Sambucas rolling. After overdoing it and regurgitating he emerges from the bathroom to find Mini dancing closely with a smug Ryder. As Nick reprimands Mini, Matty tries to intervene, and when Ryder speaks out of turn again he ends up on the receiving end of a left hook from Nick, who then abruptly leaves when Mini reveals her knowledge of his infidelity. Matty later finds him on the rugby pitch, and challenges him to a friendly 1 on 1 match, and is defeated easily by his more stable brother. His frustration boils over and he reveals the torment caused by Matty's re-emergence. Matty denies being the cause of his problems. Seeking solace in his father, which is ignored, Nick then takes his frustrations out on the kitchenware with his father's driver. Matty returns home and tells him to leave, presumably planning on taking the blame. Nick runs off into the darkness. The following morning he attempts to climb onto Liv's balcony, only to fall and for her to dismiss him. He then happens upon a prostitute leaving the house of a punter. Seeing his state she invites him home, where he takes cocaine and has sex with her but is clearly disturbed by photographs of her children. Frankie later finds him alone on a swing-set near her house and talks sense into him. Spurred on, Nick marches into his coach's office and announces he is quitting rugby, much to the coach's chagrin. He bids the team farewell and leaves. He goes home to find Matty prepared to leave home again, however Nick informs his father he wrecked the house, which his father refuses to believe. Nick confronts his father for his tactless attitude, and he eventually relents. Nick and Matty pile his father's motivational material, including a book he wrote and the contract, in the back garden, and burn it. The Levan Brothers then crack open a beer and watch the fire.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |     |             |               |\n6 | Alo | Alo Creevey | March 3, 2011 |\n\nIt is Alo's birthday, not that his domineering mother or henpecked father actually care. Rather than allowing him to visit his friends in town, they force him to stay and work on the farm. Whilst working with his father, Alo attempts to push a large rock away, which his father tells him cannot be done, prompting Alo's further attempts. After Alo runs off while he is meant to be working, his parents reveal that they intend to withdraw him from Roundview College in order to force him to buckle down on the farm. Later Alo is given a list of tasks, and instead hides in Bessy the cow's stable. He accidentally drops his burning spliff onto a tank of propane, blowing up part of the stable and Bessy. His mother and father take everything he owns as punishment, including his van and beloved dog Rags, to be sold. Burning with rage and finally reaching his limit, he invites the gang over to the farm for an impromptu party, which he hopes will trash the farmhouse. While at the party, Liv questions Franky of her sexuality to which she does ot reply. When Alo's parents return to find the teenagers fleeing the scene (Alo had mentioned that his father carried guns), Alo drunkenly confronts his aghast family and berates his father for allowing his mother to henpeck him all the time, calling him &quot;gormless and old.&quot; To his and his mother's horror, his father collapses and his mother immediately orders him to call an ambulance. Alo goes to Nick's house, where he is continuing the party from earlier, as his father is gone for the week. Franky, wanders upstairs to discover Liv and Matty having sex in his bedroom. She leaves with tears in her eyes, and Matty sees this, though he doesn't mention it to Liv. Alo goes to Rich's house, where Rich confesses that he has had sex with Grace. Rich is exuberant about growing up, which prompts Alo to leave without telling him what is wrong. Alo goes to the hospital, where he sees the farmhand and his dog, Rags. The farmhand tells him that his father is fine, but he had known about getting worse; he hadn't told Alo because he didn't want him to worry. Alo returns home and pledges to his mother that he will try harder and &quot;grow up,&quot; but demands that she makes an effort too, as she is too domineering. This encounter moves her to tears. On the farm, Alo ties a rope around the stubborn rock and hooks it to the tractor, where he tries to pull it out of the ground, and is successful with the help of his father.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |       |              |                |\n7 | Grace | Grace Violet | March 10, 2011 |\n\nRich spends the night at Grace's house to find that her father is Professor Blood. Mr and Mrs Blood discover Rich trying to sneak out across the garden, to Mr Blood's great disaproval. Mr Blood then drives Grace to school, telling her that she can live her life however she pleases, but if her grades drop she will be forced to go to boarding school. Grace is directing Twelfth Night for a college examination, all of the gang are involved, but Liv makes Matty quit the play with her when a love scene between Matty and Franky makes her suspicious. Grace invites her to a girl's night in to reassure her that everyone still loves her. Later, Professor Blood calls Rich into his office and tells him that he can make Rich's life easier if he purposefully acts badly in the play to make Grace fail, leading her to being sent away. Rich goes to dinner at Grace's house - it is very awkward and Rich tells Grace that he feels like she acts different with her parents. The girls then come over and end up taking cocaine. Mini then brings up the question of Franky's sexuality, and Franky says she's just into people. Liv suspiciously asks her who she is into at the moment, but Grace changes the subject. They all go to a club, meeting up with Matty and Rich. Mini and Franky approach two unnattractive men as a laugh, but one man becomes too forward with Franky. Matty sees and tries to intervene, ending up in an argument with Liv. Rich is drunk and vomits in the club. Grace tries to take him home, when Rich says that he doesn't know the real Grace and walks home angrily by himself. They continue the argument in the morning at rehearsal, where Rich confesses that he doesn't know if they are right for each other. Later, while reciting from Hamlet, Grace gains confidence and makes Matty rejoin the play, where he says that he loves Liv. Grace then goes to Liv where Liv reveals insecurities about what the group think of her. During the assessed performance of the play, Liv goes backstage and questions Matty on whether he loves Franky. Matty can't answer. Liv tells him that he must forget about her. After the play, Grace's parents inform her that she is going to be sent to boarding school anyway, ending with her arguing with both them and Rich. At night, Rich goes to Grace's house and serenades her with lines from Romeo and Juliet. Once in her room, through tears he asks her to marry him. She replies with Miranda's speech from the Tempest: &quot;O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world! That has such people in it!&quot;\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |          |          |                |\n8 | Everyone | Everyone | March 17, 2011 |\n\nOn Rich and Grace's wedding day, the gang are pulling together for the happy couple.
