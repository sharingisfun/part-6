The Art of Value Investing is a thoughtfully organized compilation of some of the best investment insights I have ever read. Read this book with care. It will be one of the highest-return investments you will ever make.&quot;\n\nBased on interviews with the world's most-successful value investors, The Art of Value Investing offers a comprehensive set of answers to the questions every equity money manager should have thought through clearly before holding himself or herself out as a worthy steward of other people's money. What market inefficiencies will I try to exploit? How will I generate ideas? What will be my geographic focus? What analytical edge will I hope to have? What valuation methodologies will I use? What time horizon will I typically employ? How many stocks will I own? How specifically will I decide to buy or sell? Will I hedge, and how? How will I keep my emotions from getting the best of me?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39e38c1213a82a38fe6f843edf7eb269000ca6c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Value+Investing%3A+How+the+World%27s+Best+Investors+Beat+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39e38c1213a82a38fe6f843edf7eb269000ca6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,158,56,193,33,58,130,163,143,230,248,67,237,247,235,38,144,0,202,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
