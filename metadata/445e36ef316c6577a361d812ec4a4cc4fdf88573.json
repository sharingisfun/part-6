Contrary to the usual popular stereotype, that encounter proves most pleasant as they quickly become staunch allies whose individual differences complement each other well.\n\nSet at the beginning of what the Wizard Shazam calls &quot;the second age of the great heroes&quot;, after the debut of the Man of Steel, Batman, and Captain Marvel, but before the coming of Wonder Woman, the Flash, and Green Lantern, the story begins with Superman traveling to Fawcett City in pursuit of a group of criminals who have just robbed a museum from Metropolis and used magic against him. Upon arriving in Fawcett, he finds Captain Marvel fighting the same group of thieves. \n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:445e36ef316c6577a361d812ec4a4cc4fdf88573","amp;dn":"Superman+Shazam+-+First+Thunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"445e36ef316c6577a361d812ec4a4cc4fdf88573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,94,54,239,49,108,101,119,163,97,216,18,236,74,76,196,253,248,133,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
