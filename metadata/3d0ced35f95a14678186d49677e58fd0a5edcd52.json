It is a similar fine blend that Lysandros (drums, percussion) and Orestis (DJ, programming) Falireas do - only in musical terms![/b]\nOn the one hand the unique sound of rebetiko, a sort of outlaw Greek blues that captivated the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music scene from the turn of the century until the early 1950s, and one the other hand a combination of trip-hop, drum &amp; bass and hip-hop influences Orestis was subjected to while studying in the UK in the late nineties. Just add an MC, a female voice and a fair bit of Balkan flair to the mix and there you have itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Imam Baildi!\nFalireas brothers stem from a family with a long connection with rebetiko: their father owned both a record label specialising in the genre and a popular record shop in central Athens with a vast 78rpm vinyl collection. Therefore the idea of mixing rebetiko with different types of music came about naturally to the siblings that grew up in such a musical environment.\nTheir self-tiled debut was released in 2007 on EMI Greece to great critical acclaim, followed by more than 130 live shows in Greece around Europe that included support slots for Massive Attack, Ojos De Brujo and Gogol Bordello and performances at FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Transmusicales de Rennes and DenmarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roskilde Festival.\nImam Baildi have just released their second collective effort bearing the name Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Imam Baildi CookbookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Along with original compositions and mixes it features collaborations with LA hip-hoppers Delinquent Habits and Maxwell Wright of Ojos de Brujo fame, BarcelonaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flamenco/world/hip-hop darlings.\nBorn \t2007\nmembers\nOrestis and Lysandros Falireas\nAlexis Arapatsakos\nGiannis Diskos\nPeriklis Aliopis\nLambis Kountourogiannis\nStelios Provis\nMC Yinka\nRena Morfi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0ced35f95a14678186d49677e58fd0a5edcd52","amp;dn":"imam+baildi.greek+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0ced35f95a14678186d49677e58fd0a5edcd52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,12,237,53,249,90,20,103,129,134,212,150,119,229,143,208,165,237,205,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
