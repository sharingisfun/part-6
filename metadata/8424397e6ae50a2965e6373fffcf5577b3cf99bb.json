But building that house poses design and construction difficulties that few subdivisions can match. Site conditions are often problematic - rocky, hilly, sandy - and the house is constantly exposed to sun, wind, salt, sand, and storm. A suburban home can't withstand those challenges. So what will? In A House on the Water, Maine architect Robert Knight distills his years of experience designing waterside houses into six distinct themes which take into account the needs of both interior and exterior. Over 300 color photos and numerous floor and site plans showcase 24 homes built to withstand conditions specific to the site, blend seamlessly with the native architecture, and both respect and enhance their place on the water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8424397e6ae50a2965e6373fffcf5577b3cf99bb","amp;dn":"A+House+on+the+Water+-+Inspiration+for+Living+at+the+waters+Edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8424397e6ae50a2965e6373fffcf5577b3cf99bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,36,57,126,106,229,10,41,101,230,55,63,255,207,85,119,179,207,153,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
