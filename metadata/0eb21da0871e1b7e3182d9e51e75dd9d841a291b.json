The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to\nTolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it\nis unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as\nFrodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring.\nWhile the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith\nwith the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid\ndeceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy\nSerkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and\nPhilippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic\nsweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions\nof fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that The\nReturn of the King maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful\nto Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the LOTR trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the\npower of imaginative storytelling, The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as\nan adventure for the ages. -- Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi\n\n\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 3.73 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 2 028 Kbps\nDuration: 4h 23mn\nSamples: NO\nElvish Subtitles:Fellowship of the Ring..YES\nElvish Subtitles:Two Towers..YES\nElvish Subtitles:Return of the King..YES\nArtwork - info:..YES\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc1\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 580 Kbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass Encoding\nResolution: 1280 X 528 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.098\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 444 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels [Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE]\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb21da0871e1b7e3182d9e51e75dd9d841a291b","amp;dn":"L.O.T.R+-+Return+of+the+King+2011+Extended+Ed-BDRip+720p+%5BMP4-AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb21da0871e1b7e3182d9e51e75dd9d841a291b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,178,29,160,135,30,27,126,49,130,217,229,30,117,221,157,132,26,41,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
