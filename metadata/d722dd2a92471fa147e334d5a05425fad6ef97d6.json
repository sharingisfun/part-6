Some books try to give you copy-and-paste instructions for how to deal with every single system issue that may arise, but How Linux Works actually shows you how the Linux system functions so that you can come up with your own solutions.\nAfter a guided tour of filesystems, the boot sequence, system management basics, and networking, author Brian Ward delves into open-ended topics such as development tools, custom kernels, and buying hardware, all from an administratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of view. With a mixture of background theory and real-world examples, this book shows both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to administer Linux, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ each particular technique works, so that you will know how to make Linux work for you.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1 THE BASICS\nChapter 2 DEVICES, DISKS, FILESYSTEMS, AND THE KERNEL\nChapter 3 HOW LINUX BOOTS\nChapter 4 ESSENTIAL SYSTEM FILES, SERVERS, AND UTILITIES\nChapter 5 CONFIGURING YOUR NETWORK\nChapter 6 NETWORK SERVICES\nChapter 7 INTRODUCTION TO SHELL SCRIPTS\nChapter 8 DEVELOPMENT TOOLS\nChapter 9 COMPILING SOFTWARE FROM SOURCE CODE\nChapter 10 MAINTAINING THE KERNEL\nChapter 11 CONFIGURING AND MANIPULATING PERIPHERAL DEVICES\nChapter 12 PRINTING\nChapter 13 BACKUPS\nChapter 14 SHARING FILES WITH SAMBA\nChapter 15 NETWORK FILE TRANSFER\nChapter 16 USER ENVIRONMENTS\nChapter 17 BUYING HARDWARE FOR LINUX\nChapter 18 FURTHER DIRECTIONS\nAppendix Command Classification","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d722dd2a92471fa147e334d5a05425fad6ef97d6","amp;dn":"How+Linux+Works+What+Every+Superuser+Should+Know-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d722dd2a92471fa147e334d5a05425fad6ef97d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,34,221,42,146,71,31,161,71,227,52,213,160,84,37,250,214,239,151,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
