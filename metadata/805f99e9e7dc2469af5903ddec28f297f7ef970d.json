Select video and photos, then create a Multicam Clip by automatically syncing different angles based on time of day, timecode, markers, or audio waveforms. Play back multiple angles at once in the customizable Angle Viewer, and use the powerful new Angle Editor to dive into any Multicam Clip and make precise adjustments. You can change, add, or delete camera angles at any time and work with different codecs, frame sizes, and frame rates without conversion. When itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to cut your multicam project, simply click in the Angle Viewer or use keyboard shortcuts to switch between angles on the fly.\n\n* Advanced Chroma Keying\nIn addition to using the high-quality, one-step chroma key in Final Cut Pro X, you can now access advanced keying controls for color sampling, edge adjustment, and light wrap. Tackle complex keying challenges without exporting to a motion graphics application. And play back results instantly and in context to make critical editing decisions.\n\n* Media Relink\nReconnect media and exchange files with third-party applications using a robust relink interface. Select media that has been moved or modified, or locate clips that have been transcoded, trimmed, or color graded by third-party tools. Then easily relink to your Final Cut Pro X project or Event.\n\n* Import Layered Adobe Photoshop Graphics\nImport and keep all the object layers from a Photoshop file in a single Compound Clip so you can animate, colorize, and add effects to individual layers while editing in Final Cut Pro X.\n\n* XML 1.1\nFinal Cut Pro version 10.0.3 includes support for exporting basic primary color grades to third-party applications like DaVinci Resolve. In addition, you can import and export audio keyframes and intrinsic effects parameters such as opacity and scale. This improved XML support saves time and reduces creative rework when moving projects and media between applications.\n\n* Broadcast MonitoringBeta\nOutput video to an external monitor using third-party PCIe cards or Thunderbolt I/O devices.* Connect to waveform displays, vectorscopes, and calibrated, high-quality broadcast monitors to ensure that your final project meets broadcast specifications. Or send video to large HD screens and projectors so everyone in the edit suite can see the creative process at work. Broadcast monitoring is currently in beta, and we\\\\\\'re working with third-party developers to continue to improve it over time.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBy GOSAJE (Madrid,Spain)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805f99e9e7dc2469af5903ddec28f297f7ef970d","amp;dn":"Final+Cut+Pro+X+10.0.3+%28Las+Version+February+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805f99e9e7dc2469af5903ddec28f297f7ef970d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,95,153,233,231,220,36,105,175,89,3,221,236,40,242,151,247,239,151,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
