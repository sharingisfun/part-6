What psychological and cultural pressures brought him to his fate? What liesÃ¢â‚¬â€and truthsÃ¢â‚¬â€convinced him to march toward his death? Covering warfare from prehistory through the present day, The Last Full Measure tells these soldiersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stories, ultimately capturing the experience of war as few books ever have. \n\nIn these pages, we march into battle alongside the Greek phalanx and the medieval foot soldier. We hear gunpowderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thunder in the slaughters of the Napoleonic era and the industrialized killing of the Civil War, and recoil at the modern, automated horrors of both World Wars. Finally, we witness the death of one tradition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“heroicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ combat and the construction of another in the wars of the modern era, ranging from Vietnam to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nIn exploring these conflicts and others, Stephenson draws on numerous sources to delve deep into fascinating, period-specific detailÃ¢â‚¬â€tracing, for instance, the true combat effectiveness of the musket, the utility of the cavalry charge, or the vulnerabilities of the World War II battle tank. Simultaneously, he examines larger themes and reveals surprising connections across both time and culture. What does the medieval knight have in common with the modern paratrooper? What did heroism and bravery mean to the Roman legionary, or to the World War I infantrymanÃ¢â‚¬â€and what is the true motivating power of such ideals? How do men use religion, friendship, or even nihilism to armor themselves against impending doomÃ¢â‚¬â€and what do we as human beings make of the undeniable joy some among us take in the carnage? \n\nCombining commanding prose, impeccable research, and a true sensitivity to the combatantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plight, The Last Full Measure is both a remarkably fresh journey through the annals of war and a powerful tribute to the proverbial unknown soldier. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dded46b335140f2452ab74df57c90b37bed63233","amp;dn":"The+Last+Full+Measure%3AHow+Soldiers+Die+in+Battle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dded46b335140f2452ab74df57c90b37bed63233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,237,70,179,53,20,15,36,82,171,116,223,87,201,11,55,190,214,50,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
