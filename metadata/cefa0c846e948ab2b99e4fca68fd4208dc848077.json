After the band's second album, 1991's Nevermind, nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse. Nirvana popularized punk, post-punk, and indie rock, unintentionally bringing them into the American mainstream like no other band to date. While their sound was equal parts Black Sabbath (as learned by fellow Washington underground rockers the Melvins) and Cheap Trick, Nirvana's aesthetics were strictly indie rock. They covered Vaselines songs, they revived new wave cuts by Devo, and leader Kurt Cobain relentlessly pushed his favorite bands -- whether it was the art punk of the Raincoats or the country-fried hardcore of the Meat Puppets -- as if his favorite records were always more important than his own music.\n\n\nAlbum................: The Very Best\nGenre................: Grunge\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/30/2014\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, Audiochecker\nCovers...............: Front, Back\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Smells Like Teen Spirit\n02.Come As You Are\n03.Oh, The Guilt\n04.Dive\n05.Aero Zeppelin\n06.Heart-Shaped Box\n07.Puss\n08.In Bloom\n09.Sliver\n10.Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n11.Drain You\n12.Lithium\n13.All Apologies\n14.Big Long Now\n15.Stay Away\n16.Aneurysm\n17.Rape Me\n18.School (Live)\n19.Floyd The Barber (Live)\n20.About A Girl (Live)\n21.Breed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefa0c846e948ab2b99e4fca68fd4208dc848077","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+The+Very+Best+%281994%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefa0c846e948ab2b99e4fca68fd4208dc848077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,250,12,132,110,148,138,178,185,158,79,202,104,253,66,8,220,132,128,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
