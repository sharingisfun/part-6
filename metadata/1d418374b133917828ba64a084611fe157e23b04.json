It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one, although it is never mentioned how any of the Blackadders manage to father children.\n\nAlthough the character is quite unintelligent in the first series, he is increasingly clever and perceptive in subsequent generations (while sometimes decreasing in social status). Each Blackadder though is a cynical, cowardly opportunist concerned with maintaining and increasing his own status and fortunes, regardless of his surroundings. In each series, Blackadder is an almost modern voice[citation needed] puncturing the pretensions and stupidity of those around him, and what might ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ through modern eyes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ be seen as the more ludicrous and insane follies of history (from the medieval witch-hunts and the petty whims and insanities of various British monarchs to the bloodshed and horror of World War I).\n\nThe lives of each of the Blackadders are also entwined with their servants, all from the Baldrick family line (played by Tony Robinson). Each generation acts as the dogsbody to his respective Blackadder. They decrease in intelligence (and in personal hygiene standards) just as their masters' intellect increases. Each Blackadder and Baldrick are also saddled with the company of a dim-witted aristocrat whose presence Blackadder must somehow tolerate. This role was taken in the first two series by Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), in the third series by Prince George, Prince Regent, and in the fourth by Lieutenant George, the latter two played by Hugh Laurie.\n\nEach series was set in a different period of British history, beginning in 1485 and ending in 1917 comprising six half-hour episodes. The first series, made in 1983, was called The Black Adder (set in the fictional reign of 'Richard IV'). This was followed by Blackadder II in 1985 (set during the reign of Elizabeth I), Blackadder the Third during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (set in the reign of George III), and finally Blackadder Goes Forth in 1917, set in the trenches of the Great War.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d418374b133917828ba64a084611fe157e23b04","amp;dn":"Blackadder+Seasons+1-4+%2B+Specials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d418374b133917828ba64a084611fe157e23b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,65,131,116,177,51,145,120,40,186,100,160,132,97,31,225,87,226,59,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
