Any serious film scholar--professor, undergraduate, or graduate student--will want to read and keep Film History.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df1bfc14c08cc48e8f09d1793ba524d1a95794d","amp;dn":"Film+History%3A+An+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df1bfc14c08cc48e8f09d1793ba524d1a95794d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,241,191,193,76,8,204,72,232,240,157,23,147,186,82,77,26,149,121,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
