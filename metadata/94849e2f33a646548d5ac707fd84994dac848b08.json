And they matched that wide scope with an equally wide array of three-chord tunes. So why is this such an essential record? One word: Milo. Singer Milo Aukerrman--who really was off to college after recording it--yelps &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not a Punk&quot; and &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not a Loser&quot; with such desperation that it&amp;#039;s almost touching. Then again, the nyah-nyah attitude that crops up just about everywhere else marks him as the sorta guy who&amp;#039;d probably pick your pocket as you were looking for a hankie to help dry those eyes. A quintessential American punk document. --David Sprague","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94849e2f33a646548d5ac707fd84994dac848b08","amp;dn":"Descendents+-+Milo+Goes+To+College+%281982%29+128kb%2Fs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94849e2f33a646548d5ac707fd84994dac848b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,132,158,47,51,166,70,84,141,90,199,7,253,132,153,77,172,132,139,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
