Business confidence is increasing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but still not yet secure.\nFollowing the 18% fall in tender prices between 2008 and 2013, price levels are beginning to recover some lost ground, particularly in the residential sector and with London based projects.\n\nIt is important to make sure tenders are competitive, whilst minimising your risk as input material prices and labour rates continue to rise and tender prices are forecast to increase an average of 4.5% over the next 3 years, reaching the pre 2008 recession levels in 2017.\nSpon's Architect's and Builders' Price Book, compiled by AECOM, still provides the most accurate, detailed and professionally relevant construction price information for the UK. Its unique Tender Index, updated through the year, gives an ongoing reality check and allows you to adjust for changing market conditions. Although it suits a wide range of project sizes, this is the only price book which sets out a detailed cost base for contracts exceeding Ã‚Â£3,500,000 in value.\nUse the access code inside the front cover of the book to get set up with internet access to this 2015 edition until the end of December 2015.
