The daughter of a country guitarist (Rick Lambert) and a detective agency owner, she was raised in a house dedicated to country music. Lambert began entering country talent contests when she was 16, including an appearance with the Johnny High Country Music Review in Arlington, Texas. She learned to play guitar and began writing her own songs while continuing to enter various competitions, one of which earned her an appearance in a potato chip advertisement and the 2001 teen comedy Slap Her She's French. At 17 years old, she formed the Texas Pride Band and began gigging professionally, and later in 2001 -- with financial help from her father -- she showcased her songwriting skills by releasing an independent CD, Miranda Lambert. Two of the album's tracks, &quot;Texas Pride&quot; and &quot;Somebody Else,&quot; even entered the Texas music charts.\n\n\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Girls\n02.Platinum\n03.Little Red Wagon\n04.Smokin' And Drinkin' (Feat.
