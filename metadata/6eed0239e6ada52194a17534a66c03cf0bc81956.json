Produced by George Harrison, this collection of mantras and prayers from the Vedas, Upanishads, and other scriptures powerfully transports the listener to a place of peace where it's possible to be one with the universe. It's as if a heavy, enveloping cloak of serenity falls from the dark, floating sounds of cello opening the CD. Shankar employs flute, tamboura, harp, and other instruments to accent the mighty &quot;Om&quot; thread that weaves itself through the cloth of this album, bringing together deep, ominous voices with delicate, earthly instruments. One looking for extensive Shankar sitar might be disappointed, but the beauty of this artist's creativity and spiritual vision sweeps one away into a larger, more meaningful listening experience. Highly recommended.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Vandanaa Trayee\n[02] Omkaaraaya Namaha\n[03] Vedic Chanting\n[04] Asato Maa\n[05] Sahanaa Vavavtu\n[06] Poornamadah\n[07] Gaayatri\n[08] Mahaa Mrityunjaya\n[09] Veenaa-Murali\n[10] Geetaa\n[11] Managalam\n[12] Hari Om\n[13] Svara Mantra\n[14] Vedic Chanting\n[15] Prabhujee\n[16] Sarve Shaam\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:03m:38s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 353mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi \nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Indian\nRelease Date\t&gt; 06 May 1997\nRecord Company\t&gt; Angel Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.ravishankar.org \n\t&gt; http://www.srisri.org \n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar \n\t&gt;[Chants Of India Interview]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eed0239e6ada52194a17534a66c03cf0bc81956","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Chants+Of+India+-+Ravi+Shankar+353mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eed0239e6ada52194a17534a66c03cf0bc81956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,237,2,57,230,173,165,33,148,161,117,52,166,108,3,207,11,200,25,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
