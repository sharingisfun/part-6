ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also extremely addictive, with characters so well defined that you buy them immediately. As exceptional as the actual drawings are, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite a few instances here where what happens from panel to panel isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t totally clear. MiyazakiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pacing and dialog get you through those points with room to spare, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not hard to see why he found the creation of this thing to be such a personal struggle. None of what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing here looks easy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c0b1718b86eb49adbd9d7e04858a3563a3210d8","amp;dn":"Hayao+Miyazaki%3A+Nausicaa+Of+The+Valley+Of+The+Wind+%231-7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c0b1718b86eb49adbd9d7e04858a3563a3210d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,11,23,24,184,110,180,154,219,217,215,224,72,88,163,86,58,50,16,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
