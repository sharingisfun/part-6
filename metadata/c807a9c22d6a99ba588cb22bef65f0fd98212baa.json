Nephi's journey is full of danger, mystery, intrigue and romance.\n\nWith high adventure, sweeping music and breathtaking cinematography, The Book of Mormon Movie Volume 1: The Journey will captivate and inspire. Its message of faith is just as timely now as it was 2600 years ago.&quot;\n\n-------------------------\n\nTo call it a &quot;true&quot; story is a bit of a stretch, to say the least, but I guess it's no more or less true than, say The Ten Commandments. Oh, and this is &quot;Volume 1&quot;, although no sequels were made. According to BoxOfficeMojo, the budget was $1,5 million and it grossed about $1,68 million in the US. It was widely panned by the critics that even bothered reviewing it.\n\nDirected by Gary Rogers. Written by Craig Clyde and Gary Rogers. Starring Noah Danby, Bryce Chamberlain, Jacque Gray, Jan Broberg, Mark Gollaher, Cragun Foulger, Michael Flynn, and others.\n\n--------------------------\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu251/entheta/bom9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=== File Information ===                                                  \nMovie: The Book of Mormon Movie 2003 cg entheta.avi                                \nDuration: 1:59:05                                                \nFile Size: 1,469,104,128 bytes                                              \n=== Video Information ===                                                 \nVideo Codec Name:  XviD ISO MPEG-4                                     \nVideo Bitrate: 1446                                            \nQuality Factor (Bits/Pixel): 0.201                                   \nFrames Per Second: 23.976 fps                             \nDisplay Aspect Ratio:  1.731                                        \nFrame Width &amp; Height(pixels):  720x416              \n=== Audio Information ===                                                 \nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                                                \nAudio Bitrate: 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c807a9c22d6a99ba588cb22bef65f0fd98212baa","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Mormon+Movie+2003+cg+entheta.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c807a9c22d6a99ba588cb22bef65f0fd98212baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,7,169,194,45,106,153,186,88,140,178,43,239,101,240,253,152,33,43,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
