During their battle, Farooq zaps \nThe Flash and siphons all his electricity, \nleaving The Flash without his speed. Dr. \nWells, Caitlin, and Cisco work to reverse the \neffects on Barry, but their efforts are \ndisrupted when Farooq comes banging on \nS.T.A.R. Labs doors in search of Wells, who he \nblames for his accident. Without Barry's \npowers to protect them, the group must figure \nout a way to save themselves from the \nmetahuman. Meanwhile, Tockman manages a coup \ninside the Central City police department and \ntakes several people hostage, including Joe \nand Iris. While Iris is sure The Flash will \nsave them, Eddie has a trick up his sleeve. \n\n18/Slower\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a31ceeedb3c6e8ab6b2f6d773561d32fb17f454f","amp;dn":"The.Flash.2014.S01E07.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a31ceeedb3c6e8ab6b2f6d773561d32fb17f454f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,28,238,237,179,198,232,171,107,47,109,119,53,97,211,47,177,127,69,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
