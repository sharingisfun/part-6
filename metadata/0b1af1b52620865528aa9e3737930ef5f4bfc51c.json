Simple instructions and great photography walk you through every step of 31 exciting recipes, making it easy to master the techniques you need and produce the soaps you want. You'll find chapters on colors (neon, oxides, mica), molds (milk jugs, yogurt containers, pipes), food (pumpkin, coffee, beer, avocado, oatmeal), and building (embedding soap in soap, funnel pour, swirling). Faiola offers everything you need to make your own soap, safely and enjoyably.\n\n\nBy Anne-Marie Faiola\nPublished by Storey Publishing in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1af1b52620865528aa9e3737930ef5f4bfc51c","amp;dn":"Soap+Crafting+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1af1b52620865528aa9e3737930ef5f4bfc51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,26,241,181,38,32,134,85,40,170,158,55,55,147,14,245,244,191,197,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
