Compatible Video Card \n\nMultiplayer Support:\n-Internet, Direct IP, LAN, Hotseat, &amp; E-mail \n-TCP/IP &amp; IPX Networks Supported\n\nInstructions:\n\n1) Download\n2) Burn or mount\n3) Install the game\n4) Install the patch \n5) Play\n\nNote: You will need to have the game disc inserted/mounted for gameplay as all music is streamed from the disc. \n\nNewer Operating Systems:\n\nI've run this game on Windows XP, XP 64-bit, Vista 64-bit, and 7 64-bit without any issues on several desktop computers of mine - however for whatever reason on two of my laptops running Windows XP the game refuses to start unless it is run in Windows 95 or 98 compadibility mode. Try this if the game gives you trouble.\n\nWidescreen Support:\n\nThe game has native support for widescreen resolutions - I've tested 1280 x 720 and 1680 x 1050 personally. The UI simply stays the same size regardless of resolution and more is shown on the gameplay area in higher resolutions. \n\nUnfortunately, if run in 95/98 compadibility mode on XP/Vista/7, the widescreen resolutions no longer appear as options. \n\nDual Monitor Problems:\n\nI've read some postings that mention game will refuse to start if dual monitors are enabled. I can't confirm this personally, but if this seems to be the case for you, try enabling only one. \n\nEnjoy!
