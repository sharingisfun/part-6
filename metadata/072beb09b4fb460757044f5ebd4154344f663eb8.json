Picked up as a mid-season replacement for 'Midnight Special,' SCTV aired Friday nights at 12:30am starting in May 1981 (while the CBC and US stations were still repeating Series 3).\n\nSeries 4 features perhaps the definitive cast: the Series 2 cast plus Moranis (both Tony Rosato and Robin Duke were poached by Saturday Night Live). It also features some of their finest shows. The first production cycle starts slowly, featuring mostly old material from previous seasons, sometimes subtly edited or with new voiceovers, but finishes with an amazing set of five wraparound shows: Johnny LaRue goes over budget, Guy loses sponsors and runs a pledge drive, Lola cracks up, and Bob and Doug find a good topic.\n\nThe first four shows of Cycle 1 feature a new opening, narrated by Dave Thomas, wherein the cast arrives in, and then is thrown out of New York City. With episode five, the show gets a a visual makeover, along with a new more generic opening. Bumper graphics and the logo (along with many sets, such as Guy's office) for the entire cycle are holdovers from Series 3.\n\n1982 Emmy nominations/award:\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072beb09b4fb460757044f5ebd4154344f663eb8","amp;dn":"SCTV+Network+90-DVD+Volume+1of5+%282004%29.DVDRip.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072beb09b4fb460757044f5ebd4154344f663eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,43,235,9,180,251,70,7,87,4,79,94,189,65,84,52,79,102,62,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
