The proper name and title of the character is Elric VIII, 428th Emperor of MelnibonÃƒÂ©. Later novels by Moorcock mark Elric as a facet of the Eternal Champion.\n\nElric first appeared in print in MoorcockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novella, &quot;The Dreaming City&quot; (Science Fantasy #47, June 1961); subsequent novellas were reformatted as the novel Stormbringer (1965), but his first appearance in an original novel wasn't until 1973 in Elric of MelnibonÃƒÂ©. Moorcock's albinistic character is one of the better known in fantasy literature, having crossed over into multimedia, such as comics and film, though efforts towards the latter stalled over the years. The novels have been continuously in print since the 1970s.\n\nThe only thing I can'tfind is Weird Business (1995)\n\nI've included Corum and Hawkmoon comic as  well\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric_(comics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric_(comics)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/elric/29-37393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/elric/29-37393/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/07/08/exclusive-preview-elric-the-balance-lost-11-from-boom-studios/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/07/08/exclusive-preview-elric-the-balance-lost-11-from-boom-studios/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\n(1971-1972) Conan the Barbarian v1\n\n(1983-1984) Elric of MelnibonÃƒÂ©\n\n(1985-1986) Elric - Sailor on the Seas of Fate\n\n(1986-1987) Elric - The Weird of the White Wolf\n\n(1987-1988) Elric - The Vanishing Tower\n\n(1988-1989) Elric - Bane of the Black Sword\n\n(1997) Elric - Stormbringer\n\n(1997-1998) Michael Moorcock's Multiverse\n\n(2004-2006) Elric - The Making of a Sorcerer\n\n(2005) Tom Strong - The Black Blade of the Barbary Coast\n\n(2011-2012) Elric - The Balance Lost\n\nCorum(1987-1988) Chronicles of Corum\t\n\nCorum(1989) Corum - The Bull and the Spear\n\nHawkmoon(1986) Hawkmoon - Jewel in the Skull\n\nHawkmoon(1987) Hawkmoon - The Mad God's Amulet\n\nHawkmoon(1987-1988) Hawkmoon - The Sword of the Dawn\n\nHawkmoon(1988) Hawkmoon - The Runestaff\n\n(1973) Elric - The Fall of the Dreaming City.cbr\t11.6 MB\t\n(1975) Giant-Size Conan the Barbarian 05 (reprints #s 14 &amp; 15).cbr\t34.6 MB\t\n(1976)  Star Reach 06 - Prisoner of Pan Tang.cbr\t10.2 MB\t\n(1979) Heavy Metal v03 05 + 07 Elric.cbr\t13.5 MB\t\n(1979) The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell.cbr\t27.0 MB\t\n(1980) Epic Illustrated 03-04 - The Dreaming City.cbr\t10.6 MB\t\n(1981) Elric - The Dreaming City GN.cbr\t43.4 MB\t\n(1982) Epic Illustrated 14 - While The Gods Laugh.cbr\t8.96 MB\t\n(1983) Epic Illustrated 20 - Elric.cbr\t1.33 MB\t\n(1987) Wendy Pini Law and Chaos - The Stormbringer Animated Film Project.cbr\t82.0 MB\t\n(1996) One Life Furnished In Early Moorcock.cbr\t8.68 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d003c2ab4fc4af17f67de56c9a7ca5c161a7f726","amp;dn":"Elric++of+Melnibone+-+Eternal+Champion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d003c2ab4fc4af17f67de56c9a7ca5c161a7f726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,3,194,171,79,196,175,23,246,125,229,108,154,124,165,193,97,167,247,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
