While this book is ideal for more experienced players, all of the arrangements are written in tablature so that anyone can play without having to read music. Most amazing is how well these famous pieces by J. S. Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Joplin and others translate to the ukulele. Works include &quot;Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring,&quot; &quot;Fur Elise,&quot; &quot;Chop Sticks,&quot; &quot;Greensleeves,&quot; &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer.&quot; Also included is a CD of all of the arrangements magnificently performed by John King himself. All works are arranged for GCEA tuned ukuleles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3207970fbba0ec8210fd6b4745618ecc62089f","amp;dn":"John+King+-+The+Classical+Ukulele","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3207970fbba0ec8210fd6b4745618ecc62089f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,50,7,151,15,187,160,236,130,16,253,107,71,69,97,142,204,98,8,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
