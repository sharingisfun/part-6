Have any of them given you a successful method for making profits and reducing risks? Is there even one such book that has proven reliable over the years?\n\nAlas, most investors would say &quot;no.&quot; That's because so few investment books are &quot;classic&quot; in the true sense: For years investors keep buying the book, and they keep using the method to make the most of their opportunities.\n\nThree decades ago -- 1978 -- is one of the last times an investment book was written that is worthy of being called &quot;classic.&quot;\n\nOne of the two men who authored that book was a 26 year-old market analyst working at Merrill Lynch's headquarters on Wall Street. The young man had earned a lot of attention in a short time by using a forecasting tool that almost no one had heard of.\n\nYet his market forecasts were startlingly accurate: Robert Prechter was the young man's name, and he used a method called the &quot;Elliott Wave Principle.&quot;\n\nA. J. Frost was one of the few other financial professionals who used the Wave Principle. In a distinguished 20-year career, Frost had likewise made many astonishingly accurate forecasts. His colleagues regarded him as the consummate technical analyst.\n\nFrost and Prechter met in May of 1977 and became fast friends. Eighteen months later, they published Elliott Wave Principle - Key to Market Behavior. The Dow Industrials stood at 790. But the brash forecast in this new book called for a Great Bull Market. It became a run-away best seller.\n\nThree decades is enough time for investors to deem a book about an investment method as &quot;classic,&quot; and surely the jury is in on this one: Elliott Wave Principle is now published in seven languages, and continues to sell thousands of copies every year. In Europe, Asia and the Americas, literally millions of investors worldwide use or recognize the Elliott Wave method for profitable investing.\n\nElliott Wave International is proud to present the 10th edition of this investment classic. It's designed to help the Elliott Wave novice and the veteran practitioner. It's time to consider what this definitive text offers you. Here's a sample of what you'll learn:\n\nThe basic tenets of Wave Theory: You'll read simple explanations of the terms, and how to identify all 13 waves that can occur in the movement of stock market averages.\nThe rules and guidelines of Wave analysis: You'll learn the basics of counting waves, how to recognize the &quot;right look&quot; of a wave, plus lots of simple steps for applying the rules.\nThe scientific background of the Wave Principle: How you can see it in nature and the universe, in art and mathematics, even in the shape of the human body.\nLong-term waves: You'll see how the Wave Principle gives history greater meaning, from the fall of the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages into the financial upheavals of the 20th Century. Understanding these monumental trends will help you position yourself for long-term profit and protection.\nStocks, commodities and gold: The Wave Principle is your guide to the movements of any financial market. Few pleasures can match the exhilaration you'll feel when a Wave Principle forecast has you in the market when it moves up, or takes you out just before it moves down.\nObviously, Elliott Wave Principle - Key to Market Behavior is the perfect companion to Bob Prechter's Elliott Wave Theorist publication. The book is essential reading for you to receive the most from what the Theorist says every month -- in fact, all of EWI's publications continually reference this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a61353aaf28f6e25577ba29b126a7f428120cf6","amp;dn":"Elliott+Wave+Principle%3A++Market+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a61353aaf28f6e25577ba29b126a7f428120cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,97,53,58,175,40,246,226,85,119,186,41,177,38,167,244,40,18,12,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
