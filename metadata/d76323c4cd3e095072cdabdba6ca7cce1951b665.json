Their sound was characterised\nby a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock,combining the psychedelia-themed\nlyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's voice and blues bass playing and\nGinger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the\nworld's first platinum-selling double album. Cream are widely regarded as being the world's\nfirst successful supergroup. In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\n\nCream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot;,\nand modern blues such as &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, as well as more eccentric songs such as\n&quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Toad&quot;. Cream's biggest hits were\n&quot;I Feel Free&quot; [UK, #11], &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; [US, #5], &quot;White Room&quot; [US, #6],\n&quot;Crossroads&quot; [US, #28], and &quot;Badge&quot; [UK, #18].\n\nCream made a significant impact upon the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix,\nthey popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient\nmusical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin,\nDeep Purple, and The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s. The band's live performances influenced\nprogressive rock acts such as Rush, jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead,\nPhish and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.\n\nCream was ranked #16 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Rolling Stone named them\nthe sixty-sixth greatest artist of all time. In 2010 VH1 also ranked them #61 on their 100\nGreatest Artists of All Time.\n\n\nRoyal Albert Hall, London May 2-3-5-6, 2005 is the live recording of the Cream reunion\nat the Royal Albert Hall in 2005.
