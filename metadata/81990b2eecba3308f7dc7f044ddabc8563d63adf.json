The album was released on July 23, 2012, in the UK and July 24, 2012, in the United States via Roadrunner Records. The title is a reference to the critically acclaimed post-rock album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, released by the band Godspeed You! Black Emperor in 2000. The album features hit singles, fan favorites, and live tracks. The two-disc version of Antennas to Hell features a bonus live CD capturing Slipknot's performance at the 2009 Download Festival in Donington Park, England. The three-disc version includes a bonus DVD featuring every Slipknot music video and ten brand new video features, titled &quot;Broadcasts from Hell&quot;, created by Shawn Crahan. It is the first album released by the band since late bassist's Paul Gray's death in 2010. Despite being a greatest hits collection, Clown of Slipknot has stated that it's more of a tribute to what Slipknot were and used to be at the time of the songs, and also said that the collection comes with lots of artwork.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Reception\n        1.1 Critical\n        1.2 Commercial\n    2 Artwork\n    3 Track listing\n    4 Personnel\n    \n\nReception\nCritical\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t4/5 stars\nArtistdirect \t5/5 stars\nBBC Music \tfavourable\nCraveOnline \t9/10]\nThe New Zealand Herald \t4/5 stars\n\nAntennas to Hell has been generally received well by critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect stated that, &quot;Their track record continues to be flawless and, unlike many of their contemporaries, they've outlasted nu metal, metalcore, and any other trends imaginable. They're rock's proverbial last men standing, and Antennas to Hell perfectly covers their now legendary career with highlights from each release and some mind-blowing bonuses.&quot;\nCommercial\n\nThe album debuted at number 18 on the U.S. Billboard 200 with sales of more than 16,000 copies in its first week.\nArtwork\n\nThe cover art features a dark sky blue background with the devil's head. The band's &quot;S&quot; logo is also seen above the head. The back cover features a black background and one of the devil's horns. On the inside, the CD tray features percussionist Shawn Crahan's blue house. The address says 6421 and also a half 6421. The doors are a wooden door and a screen door. The screen door leads to Crahan's home and the wooden door leads to the room where the cover artwork was taken. The back of the booklet features a replica of the devil's head on a table. The CD shows a concrete background with black nails scattered all over the place.\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Slipknot. \nDisc 1 \t\nNo. \tTitle \tOriginal release \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;(sic)&quot;   \tSlipknot \t3:19\n2. \t&quot;Eyeless&quot;   \tSlipknot \t3:56\n3. \t&quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;   \tSlipknot \t2:27\n4. \t&quot;Spit It Out&quot;   \tSlipknot \t2:39\n5. \t&quot;Surfacing&quot;   \tSlipknot \t3:38\n6. \t&quot;People = Shit&quot;   \tIowa \t3:35\n7. \t&quot;Disasterpiece&quot;   \tIowa \t5:08\n8. \t&quot;Left Behind&quot;   \tIowa \t4:01\n9. \t&quot;My Plague&quot; (New Abuse Mix) \tResident Evil Soundtrack \t3:02\n10. \t&quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; (Live) \tDisasterpieces \t4:04\n11. \t&quot;Purity&quot; (Live) \tDisasterpieces \t4:35\n12. \t&quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;   \tVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) \t4:24\n13. \t&quot;Duality&quot;   \tVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) \t4:12\n14. \t&quot;Before I Forget&quot;   \tVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) \t4:24\n15. \t&quot;Vermilion&quot;   \tVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) \t5:25\n16. \t&quot;Sulfur&quot;   \tAll Hope Is Gone \t4:37\n17. \t&quot;Psychosocial&quot;   \tAll Hope Is Gone \t4:43\n18. \t&quot;Dead Memories&quot;   \tAll Hope Is Gone \t4:27\n19. \t&quot;Snuff&quot;   \tAll Hope Is Gone \t4:40\nTotal length:\n\t77:07 \t\nDisc 2 (sic)nesses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live at Download Festival 2009 \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;(sic)&quot;   \t3:45\n2. \t&quot;Eyeless&quot;   \t4:11\n3. \t&quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;   \t2:46\n4. \t&quot;Get This&quot;   \t4:05\n5. \t&quot;Before I Forget&quot;   \t4:23\n6. \t&quot;Sulfur&quot;   \t4:17\n7. \t&quot;The Blister Exists&quot;   \t5:25\n8. \t&quot;Dead Memories&quot;   \t4:04\n9. \t&quot;Left Behind&quot;   \t3:23\n10. \t&quot;Disasterpiece&quot;   \t5:00\n11. \t&quot;Vermilion&quot;   \t6:16\n12. \t&quot;Everything Ends&quot;   \t4:42\n13. \t&quot;Psychosocial&quot;   \t5:07\n14. \t&quot;Duality&quot;   \t4:46\n15. \t&quot;People = Shit&quot;   \t5:05\n16. \t&quot;Surfacing&quot;   \t4:21\n17. \t&quot;Spit It Out&quot; Personnel\n\nAside from their real names, members of the band are referred to by numbers zero through eight.\n\n    (#0) Sid Wilson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ turntables, keyboards\n    (#1) Joey Jordison Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    (#2) Paul Gray Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    (#3) Chris Fehn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ custom percussion, backing vocals\n    (#4) Josh Brainard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (Tracks 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5)\n    (#4) Jim Root Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (Tracks 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ19)\n    (#5) Craig Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ samples, media, keyboards\n    (#6) Shawn Crahan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ custom percussion, backing vocals\n    (#7) Mick Thomson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars\n    (#8) Corey Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n\nChart positions\nChart (2012) \tPeak\nposition\nAustralian Albums Chart \t16\nAustrian Albums Chart\t10\nBelgium Albums Chart (Flanders) \t32\nBelgium Albums Chart (Wallonia)\t43\nCanadian Albums Chart\t22\nDutch Albums Charts \t79\nFinnish Albums Chart \t13\nFrench Albums Chart] \t86\nGerman Albums Chart] \t10\nIrish Albums Chart] \t44\nItalian Albums Char] \t27\nNew Zealand Albums Chart\t24\nSpanish Albums Chart \t63\nSwedish Albums Chart \t14\nSwiss Albums Chart\t23\nUK Albums Chart] \t22\nU.S. Billboard 200 \t18\nU.S. Rock Albums \t4\nU.S. Hard Rock Albums \t2 Well thats all I need for now....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81990b2eecba3308f7dc7f044ddabc8563d63adf","amp;dn":"Slipknot-Antennas+To+Hell+%28Compilation%29+MP3+320k++ak2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81990b2eecba3308f7dc7f044ddabc8563d63adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,153,11,46,236,186,51,8,247,220,127,4,77,218,188,133,99,214,58,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
