While his name doesn't inspire the reverence reserved for Pinetop Perkins, he had the rare opportunity to study under Chicago's blues piano legends. The journeyman cuts loose on this release and has a number of A-list stars sitting in. With a style that's both flexible and disciplined, he handles the ivories with ease. Willie Kent makes an appearance on his own tune, 'Mama Told Me', and transports the listener to a South Side juke joint. Other covers include Hound Dog Taylor's 'Walk In The Ceiling' and Earl Hooker's 'Wah Wah Blues'. Chuck takes great care in preserving the integrity of each tune and does so thanks to guest shots from Kent, Sam Lay and Carl Weathersby. A great collection of work!\n\n\n1.
