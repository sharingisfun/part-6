Harry Potter &amp; the Half-Blood Prince\n\nOrganized\n\nGood Quality (160 KBPS) (I beleive)\n\nRipped from CDs\n\nRead by Jim Dale\n\nSeed....\n\nThis is definetely my favorite of the Harry Potter Series. By far, book seven is next in line.\nThey're all amazing, but i think this one was always my favorite.\nBy the way these files work amazing on an ipod. Some MP3 players dont work as well because they will try to organize them numerically. and since i didn't put a zero in front of the single digit chapters they organize them like so....\n\n1.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\nand so on.\n2.\n20.\n21.\nYeah its a pain. Windows Media player does something like that too only worse. So even if you don't own an ipod, I still recomend using iTunes to play these. It is the best for them i think.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d726f624f1b22e4ebd129152a81e19922f69dd","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Half-Blood+Prince+Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d726f624f1b22e4ebd129152a81e19922f69dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,215,38,246,36,241,178,46,78,189,18,145,82,168,30,25,146,47,105,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
