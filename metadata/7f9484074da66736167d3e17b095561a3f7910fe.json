The Wihelm Scream\n2. What Was It You Said About Luck\n3. Half Heat Full (Old Circular) [vinyl exclusive]\n\nArriving shortly after his extraordinary, eponymous debut LP, James Blake drops one its many highlights, 'The Wilhelm Scream' backed with two new and exclusive songs 'What Was It You Said About Luck' and 'Half Heat Full (Old Circular)'. If anything, the pristine electro-acoustic dynamism of 'The Wilhelm Scream' sounds even more dazzling given it's own side and pressed to 45rpm, his intentions coming through super crisp and clear. His new song, 'What Was It You Said About Luck' is perhaps more minimal and nuanced, slyly harmonised vocals moving around the artificial space with vivid, depth perception-realigning effect, before 'Half Heat Full (Old Circular)' displays him at his most tortured, bruised with distortion and seemingly singing from inside his grandad's shed. -Boomkat.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9484074da66736167d3e17b095561a3f7910fe","amp;dn":"James+Blake+-+The+Wilhelm+Scream+%5B2011%5D+%5B256kbps+AAC%5D+HoTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9484074da66736167d3e17b095561a3f7910fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,148,132,7,77,166,103,54,22,125,62,23,176,149,86,26,63,121,16,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
