Opening with the rollicking, slap bass-driven â€œNoam Chomsky Is a Soft Revolution,â€ a future live staple that perfectly encapsulates Vanceâ€™s Otis Redding meets The Commitments vibe, the 12-track set both invigorates and soothes.\r\nProduced in Nashville by Jacquire King (James Bay, Tom Waits) â€” Elton John and Sheeran serve as executive producers â€” easy, Sunday-afternoon porch jams like â€œUpbeat Feelgoodâ€ and â€œUnlike Any Otherâ€ will do little to quell the Van Morrison comparisons, but Vance is such an affable and capable tunesmith that, even at his most Belfast Cowboy, his songs never feel like fan fiction. In fact, heâ€™s closer in tone and regional timbre to English folk-rocker Jez Lowe, especially on some of the albumâ€™s more spiritual and bucolic numbers, like the nostalgic â€œBangor Townâ€ and the impossibly lovely, hymn-like closer, â€œThe Wild Swans on the Lake.â€ Elsewhere, the albumâ€™s lead single, the wistful â€œShe Burns,â€ with its percussive, softly picked guitars and slick production, echoes Tunnel of Love-era Bruce Springsteen, while the spirited, Lumineers-esque unity anthem â€œFire It Up (The Silver Spear)â€ inspires without ever coming off as schmaltzy.\r\n\r\nWith three albums under his belt, Vance has settled into a nice groove, and on The Wild Swan, heâ€™s pulled off a neat trick. He dons some familiar hats, but never loses himself beneath the brim.\r\n\r\n01 - Noam Chomsky Is A Soft Revolution.flac\r\n02 - Upbeat Feelgood.flac\r\n03 - Coco.flac\r\n04 - Casanova.flac\r\n05 - Bangor Town.flac\r\n06 - Burden.flac\r\n07 - She Burns.flac\r\n08 - Be Like You Belong.flac\r\n09 - Unlike Any Other.flac\r\n10 - Ziggy Looked Me In The Eye.flac\r\n11 - Fire It Up (The Silver Spear).flac\r\n12 - The Wild Swans On The Lake.flacTracklist:\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: Ireland\r\nGenre: \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~722-873 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa255a9905e9c32819eea264a0bd6b96129cf929","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Foy+Vance+-+The+Wild+Swan+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa255a9905e9c32819eea264a0bd6b96129cf929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,37,90,153,5,233,195,40,25,238,162,100,160,189,107,150,18,156,249,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
