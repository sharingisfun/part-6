However, Dark Sky, three shape-shifting bass heads from London, have turned in a belter of a debut album. Carlo Anderson, Matthew Benyayer and Thomas Edwards have trodden a tightrope when trying to balance club bangers with fresh album tracks that both counterpoise and appear interesting.\n\nBut as the atmospheric teasers of Ã¢â‚¬ËœImaginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSilent FallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (video below) melt away to reveal the tough, abstract Latino stomp of Ã¢â‚¬ËœVoyagesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the smoke that bellows over the horizon screams of the fire found across the remaining seven tracks.\n\nThe trio repeat their game of lush ebb then banging flow as Ã¢â‚¬ËœLucidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœVividÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lose us in the woods, before Ã¢â‚¬ËœOdysseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rushes our senses with a huge minimal bass drop: the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest pass and most dangerous club ordinance.\n\nDark Sky find time for one more game of cat and mouse as guest vocalist Cornelia returns for Ã¢â‚¬ËœNothing ChangesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, an emotive composition that recalls the splendour of Moderat, before the haunted jaunt of Ã¢â‚¬ËœRainkistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hears scene peer dBridge add to a calm builder that succinctly transposes itself into the Eastern promise of Ã¢â‚¬ËœManukaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a sweet and spacious 4/4 romp into an Arabic hook that can stay with you for days.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear why Modeselektor have taken these boys under their wing. Dark SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evocative tinkering with the DNA of futuristic garage and widescreen techno is walking warmly in their own legendary footsteps. Ã¢â‚¬ËœImaginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is one of 2014Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s best dance albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27744ed09341e5d7cecd1cf0fd9153dbb6abe89f","amp;dn":"Dark+Sky+-+Imagin+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%2BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27744ed09341e5d7cecd1cf0fd9153dbb6abe89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,116,78,208,147,65,229,215,206,205,28,240,253,145,83,219,182,171,232,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
