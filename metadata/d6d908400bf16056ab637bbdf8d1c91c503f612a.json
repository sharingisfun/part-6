Gemma Davies, at twenty-two, has just learned this. It was also not what she had expected from her long-time and only boyfriend - ever. So when her best friend and roommate drags her out in hopes to help Gemma come alive again, the last thing she expects is to meet someone who manages to do just that. In a passionate night (on so many levels) that leaves her rattled long after she sneaks out of his hotel room.\n\nBut because nothing in Gemma's whirl-wind life can ever go seamlessly, she soon runs into the man that she'd left naked and in bed just the evening before...in the most unexpected of places. The classroom. As her Professor.\n\n...if only the surprises stopped there.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6d908400bf16056ab637bbdf8d1c91c503f612a","amp;dn":"If_I_Stay_by_Evan_Reeves.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6d908400bf16056ab637bbdf8d1c91c503f612a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,217,8,64,11,241,96,86,171,99,123,189,248,209,201,28,80,63,97,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
