Today associated with conservative politics, it is easily forgotten that the Evangelical explosion has been driven by a concern for social justice and the claim that one could stand in a direct emotional relationship with God. MacCulloch shows how it allowed the Protestant faith to burst away from its homeland in Europe to America, Africa and, recently, Asia.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3150 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.45GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged (except episode 1)\nSource: DVB-S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1067337a1000ef5671e6be4f850da6752fa773","amp;dn":"BBC+A+History+of+Christianity+5of6+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1067337a1000ef5671e6be4f850da6752fa773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,16,103,51,122,16,0,239,86,113,230,190,79,133,13,166,117,47,167,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
