The text is divided into three long chapters: ``The Hunting Way of Life''; &quot;`Never Weary of Laughter,'&quot; which speaks of family and community life; and ``A Struggle to Preserve Tradition.'' Extensive information in each category provides even those new to the subject with solid, even-handed material delivered in a respectful tone. Six photo essays and many shorter photo-and-text treatments are interspersed throughout. Two teach about contemporary hunting experiences, and several illustrate modern adaptations in 20th-century Inuit culture. ``Contests of Strength and Dexterity'' highlights the annual World Eskimo-Indian Olympics held in Fairbanks each July. ``The Messenger Feast'' examines Kivgiq, a celebration being revived on Alaska's North Slope during the darkest, coldest months. In comparison, E.S. Burch's The Eskimos (Univ. of Oklahoma, 1988) offers a similarly well-illustrated overview for high school and adult readers. People of the Ice and Snow is an excellent source for YAs.\n\nJacqueline Elsner, Athens Regional Library, GA\n\nCopyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ed96f967aa732080aba12f6893b9b5bb40692ad","amp;dn":"The+American+Indians+-+People+of+the+ice+and+snow+%28History+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ed96f967aa732080aba12f6893b9b5bb40692ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,217,111,150,122,167,50,8,10,186,18,246,137,59,155,91,180,6,146,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
