The DVD was quite successful, due to the popularity of the band and the quality of performances, which used intricately placed cameras on the headstock of a guitar and a &quot;first person&quot; point of view of several band-members. Including the DVD-ability to pick your preferred camera-angle during the show.\n\nDisasterpieces has so far sold over 3 million copies in America alone.[citation needed]\n\n\n Track listing\n\nLive at London Arena (February 15, 2002)\n\n   1.
