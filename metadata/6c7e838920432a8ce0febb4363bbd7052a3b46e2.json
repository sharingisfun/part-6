Most of the time, we never even \nnotice that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening.  But whenever we sign up for a grocery store shopping card, place a \npurchase using a credit card, or surf the Web, we are creating data.  These data are stored in large \nsets on powerful computers owned by the companies we deal with every day.  Lying within those \ndata sets are patternsÃ¢â‚¬â€indicators of our interests, our habits, and our behaviors.  Data mining \nallows people to locate and interpret those patterns, helping them make better informed decisions \nand better serve their customers.  That being said, there are also concerns about the practice of \ndata mining.  Privacy watchdog groups in particular are vocal about organizations that amass vast \nquantities of data, some of which can be very personal in nature.
