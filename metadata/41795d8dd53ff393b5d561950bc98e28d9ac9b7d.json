But then the ship sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s navigating crash-lands, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accused of killing everyone on board. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard for Jax to defend herself: she has no memory of the crash.\n\nNow imprisoned and the subject of a ruthless interrogation, Jax is on the verge of madness. Then a mysterious man breaks into her cell, offering her freedomÃ¢â‚¬â€for a price. March needs Jax to help his small band of rogue fighters break the Corp monopoly on interstellar travelÃ¢â‚¬â€and establish a new breed of jumper.\n\nJax is only good at one thingÃ¢â‚¬â€grimspaceÃ¢â‚¬â€and it will eventually kill her. So she may as well have some fun in the meantimeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n---\n\nWanderlust (Sirantha Jax #2)\n\nSirantha Jax doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take chancesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ she jumps at themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSirantha Jax is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jumper,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a woman who possesses the unique genetic makeup needed to navigate faster than light ships through grimspace. Jax has worked for the Farwan Corporation her entire career. But now the wordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out that the Corp deliberately crashed a passenger ship, and their stranglehold on intergalactic commerce has crumbledÃ¢â‚¬â€which means that Jax is out of a job.\n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also broke, due to being declared dead a little prematurely. So when the government asks her to head up a vital diplomatic mission, Jax takes it. Her mandate: journey to the planet Ithiss-Tor and convince them to join the Conglomerate.\n\nBut JaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s payday is light years away. First, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to contend with Syndicate criminals, a stormy relationship with her pilot, man-eating aliens, and her own grimspace-weakened body. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be lucky just to make it to Ithiss-Tor aliveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41795d8dd53ff393b5d561950bc98e28d9ac9b7d","amp;dn":"Ann+Aguirre+-+Sirantha+Jax+%5B1-2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41795d8dd53ff393b5d561950bc98e28d9ac9b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,121,93,141,213,63,243,147,181,213,97,149,11,201,142,40,217,172,155,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
