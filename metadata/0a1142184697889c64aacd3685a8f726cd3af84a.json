Bonus! It's 64-bit and includes a keygen!\n\n1) Install either 32 or 64bit version of Terragen 2 Deep Edition\n2) Run the XF-TERRAGEN2-KG2.exe keygen, tell it to place the license key file in your &quot;%PROGRAMFILES%Planetside SoftwareTerragen 2 Deep Edition&quot; folder, or wherever you installed Terragen 2\n\n==NOTE== AVG and other antiviruses may detect a false-postive trojan here.  AVG Free detected &quot;Downloader.Generic11.BYBT&quot;, a generic and unspecific trojan detected by heuristics, probably because of the fact that the keygen is trying to create and drop a file.  Don't worry, it's not a real virus.  I've confirmed using Sandboxie that it doesn't do anything but create a license key.  If you are worried about a virus anyway, then run the keygen in your favourite Sandbox software.\n\n3) Profit.\n\n-moeburn, Oct 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1142184697889c64aacd3685a8f726cd3af84a","amp;dn":"Terragen+2+Deep+Edition+2.4.31.1+x32x64+%2B+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1142184697889c64aacd3685a8f726cd3af84a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,17,66,24,70,151,136,156,100,170,205,54,133,168,247,38,205,58,248,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
