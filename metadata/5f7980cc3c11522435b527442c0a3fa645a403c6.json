When you start winrar.exe\nit will read the key.\n\nThere's really no need to use a keygen. There's no online\nverification of the license, so there's no need to use different\ncredentials. Plus, every a/v program in the world thinks that the\nkeygen is malware.\n\nEnjoy,\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7980cc3c11522435b527442c0a3fa645a403c6","amp;dn":"WinRAR+v5.1.0+32-bit+and+64-bit+with+KEY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7980cc3c11522435b527442c0a3fa645a403c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,121,128,204,60,17,82,36,53,181,39,68,44,10,63,166,69,164,3,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
