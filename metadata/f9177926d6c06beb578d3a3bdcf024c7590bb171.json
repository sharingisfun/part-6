Ars Technica reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as freeware.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft announced plans for a free consumer security product, designated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMorroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on 18 November 2008.[9] It marked a change in Microsoft's consumer antivirus marketing strategy: Instead of offering a subscription-based antivirus with a host of other tools, such as backup and a personal firewall, Morro would be free for all genuine installations of Windows not intended for business use (with an exception for small home based businesses) and offers protection against all types of malware.[10] Microsoft Forefront would be offered alongside MSE, with central management tools not present in MSE. On 17 June 2009, a leak of version 1.0.2140.0 revealed the internal name of Morro was changed to Microsoft Security Essentials.[11]\n\nOn 23 June 2009, Microsoft opened a public beta to 75,000 people in the United States, Israel, People's Republic of China and Brazil. At the time, Microsoft stated that MSE would be finalized and released before the end of 2009, in 20 markets and 10 languages.[12]\n\nOn 20 September 2009, Microsoft e-mailed beta testers and informed them of the upcoming release of the final build of the first version of MSE.[13] The final build was released on 29 September 2009[14][15]\n\nHardware requirements for MSE differ, depending on the operating system. For Windows XP, MSE requires at least a 500 MHz processor and 256 MB of RAM. On Windows Vista and Windows 7, MSE requires a 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM. Under any compatible operating system, a VGA screen of 800 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 600 or higher, 140 MB of free space, and an Internet connection are also required\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMSE is a security suite designed for consumers and lacks centralized management features which are found in Microsoft Forefront Client Security. It includes the same anti-malware engine (dubbed &quot;Microsoft Malware Protection Engine&quot;, or MSMPENG for short), and virus definitions that all other Microsoft desktop antimalware products share, including Forefront Client Security, Windows Live OneCare, and Windows Defender (Defender excludes the antivirus definitions which are separate from the antispyware definitions).[17] Before installation, MSE checks for the validity of the installed copy of Microsoft Windows. MSE requires no registration or personal information.[18] MSE will disable Windows Defender, as it provides protection against malware, not limited to spyware and adware.\n\nUsing default settings, archived files are decompressed, and then scanned. File downloads and e-mail attachments are also scanned. Its Dynamic Signature Service attempts to better identify malicious files by checking for updates if an application exhibits suspicious behavior. Before taking action against a suspect file, MSE prompts for user input. If no response is received in ten minutes, then the suspected malware is handled according to its default action, letting MSE determine what to do with the malware. System Restore points are created before removing found malware.\n\nMSE automatically checks for and downloads virus definition updates which are published three times a day to Microsoft Update. Alternatively, users may download the updates manually from Microsoft Security Portal.\n\nLicensing scheme\n \n\nMicrosoft allows users to freely download, install and use Microsoft Security Essentials on an unlimited number of their computers in their household which has a genuine copy of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft Security Essentials checks for genuineness of the operating system during and after installation. If the operating system is found to be not genuine Microsoft Security Essentials may cease to operate after a period of time during which user receives notifications.\n\nMicrosoft Security Essentials software license agreements also denies user the right to reverse-engineer, hack, decompile or disassemble the software or to publish or disclose the results of benchmark tests of this software to third parties without written approval from Microsoft Corporation. It also does not endorse the commercial use of this product in business environments or government agencies.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFound Viruses?\nContact &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8bc7c3a6dfcac2c6c2cbe7e2fdeea5f8ee&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nOr Comment.\n\nDownloaded From: http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/\nFeel Free To Ask Questions.\n\nNo Serial Needed!\nFreeWare!\n\n3NJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9177926d6c06beb578d3a3bdcf024c7590bb171","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Security+Essentials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9177926d6c06beb578d3a3bdcf024c7590bb171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,23,121,38,214,192,107,235,87,141,58,59,220,240,36,199,89,11,177,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
