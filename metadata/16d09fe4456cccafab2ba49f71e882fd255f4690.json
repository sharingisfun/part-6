Students are taught the basic geologic principles as well as how scientists apply these principles to unravel Earth's history. Three major themes - time, evolutionary theory, and plate tectonics - are woven together throughout the book to help students link essential material and enhance their understanding of historical geology. The sixth edition has been thoroughly updated to include the formation of the Earth-Moon system, information about the evolution of populations as a whole, and coverage of climate change throughout the text, placing an emphasis on what we don't know within the historical geology field as \n\n# Paperback: 444 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 6 edition (February 24, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495560073\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495560074","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d09fe4456cccafab2ba49f71e882fd255f4690","amp;dn":"Historical+Geology%2C6th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d09fe4456cccafab2ba49f71e882fd255f4690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,208,159,228,69,108,204,175,171,43,164,159,113,232,130,253,37,95,70,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
