It has been cited as the best-selling album series in Canadian history, with 5 million albums sold in ten years.\n\nThe Big Shiny Tunes albums are each thought to be composed of a combination of rock songs that are major hits by well-known artists, less successful songs by well-known artists and songs by more obscure artists, released in the same year as the albums&amp;#039; publication. There are a combination of Canadian, British and American performers. One common feature among the selected artists is that they are attached to Universal Music, Warner Bros., EMI Music Canada, and/or MuchMusic, who come together to produce Big Shiny Tunes albums.\n\nPart of the appeal of the series is that those who do not usually buy albums will find Big Shiny Tunes provides several well-known songs, as opposed to a CD by a single artist whose work is mostly unheard and may not be as likable. The music is aimed at teenagers and young adults.\n\nIn addition to the ordinary albums in the series, MuchMusic also released albums such as Big Shiny 80&amp;#039;s (2005) that included classics like Billy Idol&amp;#039;s &quot;White Wedding.&quot; There have also been two volumes of Big Shiny 90&amp;#039;s released.\n\nBig Shiny Tunes 2\n\nProdigy - &quot;Breathe (Edit)&quot; \nBlur - &quot;Song 2&quot; \nThird Eye Blind - &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot; \nSmash Mouth - &quot;Walkin&amp;#039; on the Sun&quot; \nSugar Ray - &quot;Fly&quot; (featuring Supercat) \nBran Van 3000 - &quot;Drinking in LA&quot; \nMarilyn Manson - &quot;Beautiful People&quot; \nHolly McNarland - &quot;Numb&quot; \nBush - &quot;Swallowed&quot; \nMatchbox 20 - &quot;Push&quot; \nCollective Soul - &quot;Precious Declaration (Remix)&quot; \nThe Tea Party - &quot;Temptation (Edit) (Tom Lord-Alge Mix)&quot; \nThe Chemical Brothers - &quot;Block Rockin&amp;#039; Beats (Radio Edit)&quot; \nWide Mouth Mason - &quot;My Old Self&quot; \nRadiohead - &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; \nThe Age of Electric - &quot;Remote Control&quot; \nStone Temple Pilots - &quot;Lady Picture Show&quot; \n\nReleased 12/2/1997 \nLength 66:22 \nLabel Warner Music Canada \n-----\n\nBig Shiny Tunes 3\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins - &quot;Ava Adore&quot; \nFastball - &quot;The Way&quot; \nFoo Fighters - &quot;My Hero&quot; \nMatthew Good Band - &quot;Apparitions (edit)&quot; \nSemisonic - &quot;Closing Time&quot; \nBarenaked Ladies - &quot;One Week&quot; \nBeastie Boys - &quot;Three MCs and One DJ&quot; \nRob Zombie - &quot;Dragula (The Hot Rod Herman Mix)&quot; \nThird Eye Blind - &quot;How&amp;#039;s It Going to Be&quot; \nSloan - &quot;Money City Maniacs&quot; \nLenny Kravitz - &quot;Fly Away&quot; \nPlacebo - &quot;Pure Morning&quot; \nGarbage - &quot;Push It&quot; \nRadiohead - &quot;Karma Police&quot; \nGoo Goo Dolls - &quot;Iris&quot; \nBig Wreck - &quot;That Song&quot; \nMonster Magnet - &quot;Space Lord&quot; \n\nReleased 12/1/1998 \nLabel EMI Music Canada\n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7c68c3e0bc38c89ccfa2b70f399475e08ab0c5","amp;dn":"Big+Shiny+Tunes+2-3+%5BHQ+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7c68c3e0bc38c89ccfa2b70f399475e08ab0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,124,104,195,224,188,56,200,156,207,162,183,15,57,148,117,224,138,176,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
