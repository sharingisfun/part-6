Get the blood. Rule the world. A stand-alone short story in the Ustari Cycle. \r\nMost people never learn what a Stringer isâ€”and their lives are better for it. Lem, however, gets to learn about them and possession by alien intelligences the hard way. A must-read in the gritty supernatural series that includes We Are Not Good People from the â€œexhilarating, powerful, and entertainingâ€ (Guardian) storyteller of the Avery Cates series. \r\nFor blood mages, the twenty-first century means hiding in the shadows, keeping society unaware of their incredible powers. The power-hungry sort plot quietly to manufacture tragedies bloody enough to give them the gas they need to cast something monumental. Lem and Mags, down-and-out bosom buddies to the end, try to be good, bleeding nobody but themselves, skating by on small Cantrips, cons, and charms. \r\nSo when the siren song of easy money comes their way in the form of helping out a friend, clearly no good will come of it. Blood mages are not good people. And neither are Stringersâ€”alien intelligences that can take over a body and run it ragged. Stringers: they arenâ€™t subtle, arenâ€™t content to skulk in the shadows, and arenâ€™t a houseguest anyone wants. Lem is about to learn what a possession hangover feels likeâ€”if Mags and his more tentative allies can figure out how to stop the demon without killing him. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c76081d90a4fbcffdc1116d38b753b96b36b4e7","amp;dn":"The+Stringer+-++Jeff+Somers+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c76081d90a4fbcffdc1116d38b753b96b36b4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,118,8,29,144,164,251,207,253,193,17,109,56,183,83,185,107,54,180,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
