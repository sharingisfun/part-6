It features an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993 for the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 14, 1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played a setlist composed of mainly lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines, David Bowie, Meat Puppets (during which they were joined by two members of the group onstage) and Lead Belly.\n\nMTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released in the wake of the April 1994 suicide of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the group's most successful posthumous release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with.[1] MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: &quot;Something in the Way&quot; and &quot;Oh, Me.&quot; The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] About A Girl\n[02] Come As You Are\n[03] Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam\n[04] The Man Who Sold The World\n[05] Pennyroyal Tea\n[06] Dumb\n[07] Polly\n[08] On A Plain\n[09] Something In The Way\n[10] Plateau\n[11] Oh, Me\n[12] Lake Of Fire\n[13] All Apologies\n[14] Where Did You Sleep Last Night\n \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:53m:50s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 131mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Grunge Rock\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 01 November 1994\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Geffen Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.nirvanamusic.com\n-\n- http://www.nirvana-music.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/nirvana  \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ac8bad960cf7c9775bea6a57ba46533fd34182","amp;dn":"%5B1994%5D+MTV+Unplugged+In+New+York+-+Nirvana+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ac8bad960cf7c9775bea6a57ba46533fd34182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,172,139,173,150,12,247,201,119,91,234,106,87,186,70,83,63,211,65,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
