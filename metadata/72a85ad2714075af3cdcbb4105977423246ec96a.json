It won the Gramophone Engineering Award in 1987, and 20 years later it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s still considered by many to be among the best available demonstration discs. The sound Decca captured from this orchestra is beautiful.\n\nMars is never more chilling than it is here; the full-orchestra tutti at the climax is startlingly powerful, and the trombones that follow are fierce. Saturn is achingly mournful, Uranus nightmarish, and Neptune is awe-inspiring in its evocation of the infinite depths of space. All the movements are outstanding...\n\n\n\\\\\\&quot;A superb recording ... the best available. This spell-binding account of Holst\\\\\\&amp;#039;s The Planets could be recommended hand-on-heart as a supreme example of today\\\\\\&amp;#039;s orchestral recording standards.\\\\\\&quot; - Gramophone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a85ad2714075af3cdcbb4105977423246ec96a","amp;dn":"Holst+-+The+Planets+%28Dutoit%2C+Montreal+Symp.%29+EAC+-%3E+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a85ad2714075af3cdcbb4105977423246ec96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,168,90,210,113,64,117,175,60,220,187,65,5,151,116,35,36,110,201,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
