Those featured or co-billed guitarist John Abercrombie and tended to be more fusion affairs in the Larry Young mode. \n\nFor his venture into the Beck repertoire he has brought aboard sax legend Dave &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman for a decidedly funkier approach. The set leans heavily on the young Hansen's Odelay tunes but manages to also include a smattering of songs from each of the artist's recordings. The harmonic and melodic limitations of the material are evident, but so too are its blues and funk roots. Beck's songwriting is all groove, attitude, and atmosphere making it ideal for the organ trio context. Drummer Lafrae Sci helps deepen the pocket, while triple-threat Doug Munro thickens the atmosphere as arranger/producer, and adds to the attitude with his tasteful and witty guitar work. \nThese grease-meisters turn &quot;New Pollution&quot; into a stone shuffle, make &quot;Devil's Haircut&quot; more satanic, and often make the original recordings literally pale by comparison. \n\nAs the honoree might say, this disc is &quot;Where It's At.&quot;\n\n\nCD / 2003 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 Paper Tiger \t \n2 Tropicalia \t \n3 Mixed Buziness \t \n4 The New Pollution \t \n5 Devil's Haircut \t \n6 Sexx Laws \t  \n7 Loser \t \n8 Jackass \t \n9 Where It's At \t \n10He's A Mighty Good Leader \t \n11Nobody's Fault \t\n\n\nPersonnel:\nDr. Lonnie Smith, Hammond B-3 organ \nDavid Fathead Newman, saxophone\nDoug Munro, guitar \nLafrae Sci, drums\n\n\nShaken, not stirred.\n\n\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aeb3cc4469a6e890ac62303b518f66039fa797f","amp;dn":"Dr.+Lonnie+Smith+-+Boogaloo+To+Beck+2003+%2F+A+Tribute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aeb3cc4469a6e890ac62303b518f66039fa797f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,235,60,196,70,154,110,137,10,198,35,3,181,24,246,96,57,250,121,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
