Their debut, Lights Out, was an understated one, centered around just two guitars (one electric, one acoustic) and their two voices. Following the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release in August of 2011, Big Deal made plans to play several U.K. festivals, including Wireless, Lounge on the Farm, and Reading and Leeds. For their second album June Gloom, the pair worked with producer Rory Attwell, who helped add a '90s noise-pop inspired heft to their sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:020cb9d4c87cbf7ffc4cf183bb0142b163ea16b0","amp;dn":"Big+Deal+-+June+Gloom+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"020cb9d4c87cbf7ffc4cf183bb0142b163ea16b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,12,185,212,200,124,191,127,252,76,241,131,187,1,66,177,99,234,22,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
