During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRequired:\n\nDual 2.0Ghz CPU, 2.5GB RAM, OpenCL compatible GPU (DX10.1+), 4GB HD 64bit\n\nRecommended For Best Results:\n\nDual 3.0Ghz CPU, 4GB+DDR3 RAM, 64bit OS, DX11 GPU, 6GB HD\n\nInstallation:\n1.
