When President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his famous warning about the dangers of the military industrial complex, he never would have dreamed that a company could accumulate the kind of power and influence now wielded by this behemoth company.\nAs a full-service weapons maker, Lockheed Martin receives over $25 billion per year in Pentagon contracts. From aircraft and munitions, to the abysmal Star Wars missile defense program, to the spy satellites that the NSA has used to monitor AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ phone calls without their knowledge, Lockheed MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaches into all areas of US defense and American life. William HartungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meticulously researched history follows the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meteoric growth and explains how this arms industry giant has shaped US foreign policy for decades.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Prophets-War-Lockheed-Military-Industrial-Complex/dp/B0057DC37I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373500521&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=prophets+of+war&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Prophets-War-Lockheed-Military-Industrial-Complex/dp/B0057DC37I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373500521&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=prophets+of+war&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef6b3e68f97778b40d52e820bdcef40c0a70a26","amp;dn":"Prophets+of+War%3A+Lockheed+Martin+and+the+Making+of+the+Military-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef6b3e68f97778b40d52e820bdcef40c0a70a26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,246,179,230,143,151,119,139,64,213,46,130,11,220,239,64,192,167,10,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
