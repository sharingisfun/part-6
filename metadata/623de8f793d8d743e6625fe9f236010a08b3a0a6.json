The contributors and editors offer a comprehensive review of the main types of polymer nanocomposites and their properties.The first half reviews the range of layered silicates and discusses such properties as flammability, thermal stability, barrier properties, wear resistant and biodegradability. The second part considers nanotubes, nanoparticles, and inorganic-organic hybrid systems, and analysis elasticity and strength as well as magnetic and light-emitting properties","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:623de8f793d8d743e6625fe9f236010a08b3a0a6","amp;dn":"Polymer+Nanocomposites+%28CRC%2C+Woodhead%2C+2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"623de8f793d8d743e6625fe9f236010a08b3a0a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,61,232,247,147,216,215,67,230,98,95,233,242,54,1,10,8,179,160,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
