Further, Rogers believes that you cannot be a successful investor in stocks, bonds, or currencies without an understanding of commodities. Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market is designed to introduce the novice to the basics of investing in commodities as well as explain what they are and why they are important. In doing so, he shatters some myths about the relative risks of commodities, explains the relationship between the stock and commodities markets, and provides a succinct analysis and history of the global oil, gold, lead, sugar, and coffee markets.\nRogers also offers practical advice and information for beginners, including the best resources, how to read the commodities reports in the newspaper or on television, the various ways to open an account, information on index funds (such as Rogers' own index fund that he started in 1998), mechanisms, terminology, and other vital details people must know before investing. Clearly written and entertaining, Hot Commodities offers a solid introduction to investments that many people, including financial advisors, fail to give the proper respect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1e27308731c9dcabbe7975530b9f40007e5e3a0","amp;dn":"Jim+Rogers+--+Hot+Commodities%2C+How+Anyone+Can+Invest+Profitably+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1e27308731c9dcabbe7975530b9f40007e5e3a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,226,115,8,115,28,157,202,187,231,151,85,48,185,244,0,7,229,227,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
