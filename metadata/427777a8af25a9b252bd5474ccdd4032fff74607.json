Breathe (01:44)\n\nHailing from Colarado, Elephant Revival is a collective of folk-inspired musicians led by Bridget LawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and fiddle, joined by a quartet of other musicians, including Dango Rose on bass and Daniel Rodriguez on guitars. Everybody sings, and everybody plays multiple instruments. All this activity amounts to a wide variety of lush, mostly-acoustic sounds, which veer from the country-bluegrass end of the spectrum (Ã¢â‚¬Å“LexingtonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Break in the CloudsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to moodier, bass-heavy tunes (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cosmic PulseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DropÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). If indie rock were played primarily on mandolin, cello, banjo, and octave violin, it might sound something like this.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to say that the songs are experimental or bizarreÃ¢â‚¬â€guitar and vocals remain the focus of these songs, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just that the arrangements and instrumentation lend something refreshing to many of them. The fiddle on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barefoot FriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brings an alt-country vibe, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Break in the CloudsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is reminiscent of a waltz. Most of all, what makes this record so successfulÃ¢â‚¬â€and it is very successful indeedÃ¢â‚¬â€are the songs, which are solidly constructed and performed with conviction. At 14 tracks, the album loses momentum in its second half, but remains generally engaging nevertheless, and well worth a listen to anyone with a fondness for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“folkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ element of Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk-rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:427777a8af25a9b252bd5474ccdd4032fff74607","amp;dn":"Elephant+Revival+-+Break+in+the+Clouds+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"427777a8af25a9b252bd5474ccdd4032fff74607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,119,119,168,175,37,169,178,82,189,84,116,204,221,64,50,255,247,70,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
