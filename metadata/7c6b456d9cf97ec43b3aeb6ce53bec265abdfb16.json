Although the Sanskrit original was composed by Valmiki around the fourth century BC, poets have produced countless versions in different languages. Here, drawing on the work of an eleventh-century poet called Kamban, Narayan employs the skills of a master novelist to re-create the excitement he found in the original. A luminous saga made accessible to new generations of readers, The Ramayana can be enjoyed for its spiritual wisdom, or as a thrilling tale of ancient conflict.\n\nAbout the Author\nR. K. Narayan (1906Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001), born and educated in India, was the author of fourteen novels, numerous short stories and essays, a memoir, and three retold myths. His work, championed by Graham Greene, who became a close friend, was often compared to that of Dickens, Chekhov, Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor, among others. October 10, 2006, is the centennial of Narayan's birth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c6b456d9cf97ec43b3aeb6ce53bec265abdfb16","amp;dn":"The+Ramayana+-+R.+K.+Narayan+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c6b456d9cf97ec43b3aeb6ce53bec265abdfb16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,107,69,109,156,249,126,196,59,58,235,108,229,59,236,38,90,189,251,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
