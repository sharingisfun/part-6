The band is composed of the original lineup of seminal experimental emo indie band Cap'n Jazz soon after its second breakup (the first came in 1995); Cap'n Jazz guitarist Davey von Bohlen, who played in the band's second incarnation, had gone on to found influential emo band The Promise Ring and did not participate in Owls. The band's lineup consisted of brothers Tim Kinsella and Mike Kinsella (on vocals and drums), along with guitarist Victor Villareal and bassist Sam Zurick. Tim Kinsella and Zurick have also played together in Joan of Arc and Make Believe, and Villareal and Zurick have played together in the instrumental-rock Ghosts and Vodka.\n\nThe band dissolved in 2002. Mike Kinsella left to concentrate on his solo project, Owen. He was replaced by Ryan Rapsys.\n\nOwls recently reunited and began rehearsing in March 2012.\n\n--Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n==Track listing==\n\n01  &quot;What Whorse You Wrote Id On&quot;\n02  &quot;We Are The Owls&quot;\n03  &quot;I Want The Quiet Moments Of A Party Girl&quot;\n04  &quot;Everyone Is My Friend&quot;\n05  &quot;I Want The Blindingly Cute To Confide In Me&quot;\n06  &quot;For Nate's Brother Whose Name I Never Knew or Can't Remember&quot;\n07  &quot;Life In The Hair Salon-Themed Bar On The Island&quot;\n08  &quot;Holy Fucking Ghost&quot;\n09  &quot;Later&quot; (Japanese Bonus Track)\n10  &quot;Anyone Can Have A Good Time&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037f193545da989cd78b9fa4bf1c554a58bd6be7","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Owls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037f193545da989cd78b9fa4bf1c554a58bd6be7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,127,25,53,69,218,152,156,215,139,159,164,191,28,85,74,88,189,107,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
