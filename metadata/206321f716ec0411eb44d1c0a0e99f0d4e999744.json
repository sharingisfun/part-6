What we have here is an amazing rebroadcast of a 20 minute long documentary about the band Yes, made in late 1971. It features wonderful live video and audio of classic yes songs, such as &quot;Yours is No Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; and much more, all of which was taken at their show in Hemel Hampstead on October 3rd, 1971. It also features many great interviews with all 4 band members on many different topics. Overall a must have video for all fans of the classic yes lineup\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nP.S. - Original file info is a little lackluster, so I apologise about that.
