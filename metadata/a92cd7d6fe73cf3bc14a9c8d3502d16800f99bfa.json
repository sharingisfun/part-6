Dramatic and scary, these supernatural tales of enduring mysteries and unimaginable phenomena are enticing with their intrigue. Paranatural assembles evidence featuring eyewitness commentary and expert testimony from some of the brightest research and investigative minds.\n\n\n1)  Bermuda Triangle \nParanatural investigates the disappearances of ships and planes in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n2)  Monsters of the Deep \nFrom Loch Ness to the west coast of Canada, people are reporting sightings of creatures they can't explain. Are they seeing something Paranatural?\n\n3)  Doomsday Prophecies \nFor ages, prophets have suggested that disastrous events and maybe even the end of the world lie ahead.\n\n4)  Bigfoot Encounters \nBigfoot. Sasquatch. Abominable Snowman. Yeti. No matter what you call it, these large, hair-covered creatures that walk upright like humans have been spotted around the world.\n\n5)  Life after Life \nWhat happens when we die? Is there an afterlife? Does consciousness survive physical death? These are some of the most baffling questions known to us\n\n6)  The Haunted \nIn every culture and for centuries, witnesses report strange encounters with apparitions, or ghosts. Are they merely figments of wild imaginations?\n\n7)  Alien Encounters \nAre UFOs signs of intelligent life outside our planet, or are they just natural or man-made phenomena that some mistake for something otherworldly?\n\n8)  Animal Apocalypse \nWhy are we seeing mass animal die-offs around the world? Scientists are searching for answers, and studying why some species are beginning to vanish.\n\n9)  Crop Circles \nAcross the planet thousands of crop circles have been reported. Is there any chance crop circles are messages from another world?\n\n10)  Psychic Powers \nIn New Jersey a girl is killed and a psychic claims she can see her murderer.
