Armed with this list and several more brainstorming sessions later, Rob Papen and his development team created a powerful new virtual synth RAW.\nRAW has two oscillators each with an X/Y field, (as included in Blade and BLUEII) to distort the waveform using Phase Distortion. But that's not all, you can also draw two of your own 'waveforms' and use them as LFO waveforms enabling the creation of unique 'wobble' movements that are perfect for for DubStep and other electronic music styles.\n\nRAW has all the great Rob Papen filters to shape your sound further, but in a refreshing twist, 'EQ', Ã¢â‚¬ËœWaveshaper', 'Distortion' and 'LoFi' have also been added on a voice synthesis level. Other FX such as Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Stereo delay and the amazing HQ Reverb of Rob Papen can all be added to your sound and of course, the cool Arpeggiator/Sequencer, Easypage and preset bank manager have all been included as standard.\n\nIn true Rob Papen style, RAW comes with many great presets with mainly contributions from several well known DJs and Producers for instant user inspiration!\nPromo, Ophidian, Mad dog, Deathmachine, D-Passion, Rob Fabrie, DJ Thera, N-Vitral, Tha Playah, DJ Hidden, The Viper, Warface and many more...\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMiSSiNG iN ACTiON . . . . . . . . .\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGREETZ!\nALL PRESENT, PAST &amp; FUTURE TEAMS AND iNDs\nWHO MADE AUDiO WAREZ HiSTORY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT GOOD DEVS WHO DON'T TORTURE USERS\nWiTH SHiTTY PROTECTiONS AND BUY WHAT YOU USE AND LiKE!\n\nNFO v.1.1 - 09.2014\n- C0ME T0 THE DARK SiDE -\n- HEXWARS -\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.pw - isohunt.to - kickass.so - flashtorrents.org\nbtdigg.org -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (01)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09ff54fafbf29adb2dc526f1323bc441f33ea3d","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+RAW+v1.0.1a+OS+X+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09ff54fafbf29adb2dc526f1323bc441f33ea3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,159,245,79,175,191,41,173,178,220,82,111,19,35,188,68,31,51,234,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
