This reissue of his 1974 Inspiration Information album--a soulful song cycle that took three years to create and was worth every minute--ranges from early drum machine-driven experiments like &quot;Xl-30&quot; and &quot;Aht Uh Mi Hed&quot; (note the Sly Stone spelling influence) to Otis's most stunning pop confection ever, &quot;Strawberry Letter 23.&quot; (The latter song, which ended up being a big hit for the Brothers Johnson, is one of four bonus tracks taken from Otis's 1971 Freedom Flight album). Otis, who once turned down an offer to replace Mick Taylor in the Rolling Stones, continues to perform around the Bay Area on his own and with his father, bandleader Johnny Otis. Hopefully, the long-awaited resurrection of this material will help bring him the attention he deserves.\n\n\n01 Inspiration Information\n02 Island Letter\n03 Sparkle City\n04 Aht Uh Mi Hed\n05 Happy House\n06 Rainy Day\n07 XL-30\n08 Pling!\n09 Not Available\n10 Strawberry Letter 23\n11 Sweet Thang\n12 Ice Cold Daydream\n13 Freedom Flig\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37adf175e845289692fc55c0b78131c5dbf53773","amp;dn":"Shuggie+Otis-+%281974%29+Inspiration+information++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37adf175e845289692fc55c0b78131c5dbf53773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,173,241,117,232,69,40,150,146,252,85,192,183,129,49,197,219,245,55,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
