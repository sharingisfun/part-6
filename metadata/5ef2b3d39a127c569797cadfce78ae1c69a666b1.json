The result is an edition that preserves the true meaning of the great mystic's writings, presents them as clearly as possible, and at the same time gives the reader the doctrinal and historical information that will lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the teachings of the Mystical Doctor.\r\n\r\nIncluded in The Collected Works are St. John's poetry, The Ascent of Mount Carmel, The Dark Night, The Spiritual Canticle, and The Living Flame of Love, as well as his letters and other counsels. There is a general introduction for the entire work and brief, enlightening introductions for each specific work, explaining theme and structure. Enhancing these are the new footnotes, glossary of terms, and index.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ef2b3d39a127c569797cadfce78ae1c69a666b1","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Works+of+St.+John+of+the+Cross+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ef2b3d39a127c569797cadfce78ae1c69a666b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,242,179,211,154,18,124,86,151,151,202,223,206,120,174,28,105,166,102,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
