When he explained to people what he had done, they said he was stupid or suicidal. He saw it another way: he had accomplished more than he ever knew was possible. Taking on big challenges shows you possibilities you didn't know existed.\nWith that experience in mind, De Sena set up Spartan Races, a series of extreme obstacle events. Whether over three miles or marathon distances, competitors are faced with a series of challenges, from crawling through mud under barbed wire to carrying a heavy sandbag, to push them beyond their limits. De Sena shows how with a simple philosophy - commit to a goal, put in the work, and get it done - people can achieve remarkable things. Whether you are up for the challenge yourself, or just want to learn more about life at the extremes, this book is for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d7dc7955872390ab9ba7abe88f458ae5406a02","amp;dn":"Spartan+Up%21+-+Joe+De+Sena+%5BEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+PDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d7dc7955872390ab9ba7abe88f458ae5406a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,215,220,121,85,135,35,144,171,155,167,171,232,143,69,138,229,64,106,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
