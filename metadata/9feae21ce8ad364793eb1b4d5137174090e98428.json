As a result of his controversial but &quot;justified&quot;, quick-draw shooting of a mob hit-man in Miami, Givens is disciplined by being re-assigned from Miami, to Kentucky. The Lexington, Kentucky Marshals office's jurisdiction includes Harlan County (a hopelessly impoverished, backwoods, coal-mining community in southeastern Kentucky)Ã¢â‚¬â€which Raylan hates, and thought he had escaped for good, in his youth.\n\nSeason three introduces a new main villainÃ¢â‚¬â€Robert Quarles (Neal McDonough) of Detroit. The parent criminal organization connected to the Frankfort mafia has exiled Quarles to Kentucky. Quarles begins to muscle in on the local criminals, successfully supplanting them until Raylan begins investigating. Quarles' efforts also bring him into conflict with Boyd's group resulting in the deaths of several local individuals. Simultaneously, Dickie BennettÃ¢â‚¬â€the lone survivor of the Bennett clanÃ¢â‚¬â€seeks the aid of the black residents of Noble's Holler and their leader, Ellstin Limehouse (Mykelti Williamson), in recovering his inheritance. Limehouse attempts to keep his people out of the struggle between the criminal groups but becomes involved when Boyd gets the upper hand on Quarles, leading to a series of betrayals and deaths.\n\n\n\nFile Types: Mkv\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nResolution: 1276x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nOfficial Website:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/justified&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/justified&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489428/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489428/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9feae21ce8ad364793eb1b4d5137174090e98428","amp;dn":"Justified+Season+3+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9feae21ce8ad364793eb1b4d5137174090e98428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,234,226,28,232,173,54,71,147,235,27,77,81,55,23,64,144,233,132,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
