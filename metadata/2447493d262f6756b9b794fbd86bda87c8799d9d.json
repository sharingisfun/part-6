If you want 64bit Multiplayer, buy the game and support the devs. 32bit Multiplayer via Tunngle/Hamatchi IS potentially possible, as is LAN play, however none of these methods have been officially tested. As such, getting multiplayer to work via Tunngle, Hamatchi, etc is entirely up to you. If you find a way to make it work, feel free to leave a comment to help others out.\n\nTwo step run process.\n1.
