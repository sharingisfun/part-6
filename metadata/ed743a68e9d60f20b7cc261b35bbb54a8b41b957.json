Kiefer moved to the South of France from Germany in 1993 and began creating his art installation, &quot;La Ribaute&quot; on 35 acres of land belonging to an old silk factory.[4] The film begins with a lengthy silence to show the tunnels and spaces the artist created before showing the artist and his process in creating the installation and a large landscape painting. The film opened at Cannes in 2010 as a special screening.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nowness.com/day/2011/8/6/anselm-kiefers-labyrinth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nowness.com/day/2011/8/6/anselm-kiefers-labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overyourcities.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overyourcities.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed743a68e9d60f20b7cc261b35bbb54a8b41b957","amp;dn":"Over+Your+Cities+Grass+Will+Grow+%5BAnselm+Kiefer%5D+%5BSophie+Fiennes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed743a68e9d60f20b7cc261b35bbb54a8b41b957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,116,58,104,233,214,15,32,183,204,38,27,53,187,181,74,139,65,185,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
