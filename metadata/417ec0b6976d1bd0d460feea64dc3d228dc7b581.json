Dianat, Eli S. Saber (CRC, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nArming readers with both theoretical and practical knowledge, Advanced Linear Algebra for Engineers with MATLABÂ® provides real-life problems that readers can use to model and solve engineering and scientific problems in fields ranging from signal processing and communications to electromagnetics and social and health sciences.\r\n\r\nFacilitating a unique understanding of rapidly evolving linear algebra and matrix methods, this book:\r\n\r\nOutlines the basic concepts and definitions behind matrices, matrix algebra, elementary matrix operations, and matrix partitions, describing their potential use in signal and image processing applications\r\n\r\nIntroduces concepts of determinants, inverses, and their use in solving linear equations that result from electrical and mechanical-type systems\r\n\r\nPresents special matrices, linear vector spaces, and fundamental principles of orthogonality, using an appropriate blend of abstract and concrete examples and then discussing associated applications to enhance readersâ€™ visualization of presented concepts\r\n\r\nDiscusses linear operators, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, and explores their use in matrix diagonalization and singular value decomposition\r\n\r\nExtends presented concepts to define matrix polynomials and compute functions using several well-known methods, such as Sylvesterâ€™s expansion and Cayley-Hamilton\r\n\r\nIntroduces state space analysis and modeling techniques for discrete and continuous linear systems, and explores applications in control and electromechanical systems, to provide a complete solution for the state space equation\r\n\r\nShows readers how to solve engineering problems using least square, weighted least square, and total least square techniques\r\n\r\nOffers a rich selection of exercises and MATLABÂ® assignments that build a platform to enhance readersâ€™ understanding of the material\r\n\r\nStriking the appropriate balance between theory and real-life applications, this book provides both advanced students and professionals in the field with a valuable reference that they will continually consult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:417ec0b6976d1bd0d460feea64dc3d228dc7b581","amp;dn":"Advanced+Linear+Algebra+for+Engineers+with+MATLAB%26reg%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"417ec0b6976d1bd0d460feea64dc3d228dc7b581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,126,192,182,151,109,27,208,212,96,254,234,100,220,61,34,141,199,181,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
