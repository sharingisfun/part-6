A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£research and charityÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, has been operating in strict secrecyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª until now. \n  \nActing on a tip from an inside source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely.
