Wading Into Love\n\n\n\nTuxedomoon rose from the heady atmosphere of San Francisco?s post-punk golden age during the late 70?s and in 1980 they fled Reagan?s America for Europe. Since then they have been ever-present on the continents avant-garde scene with their unique brand of eerie and atmospheric jazz-influenced soundscapes. To say that the members of Tuxedomoon are prolific would be a gross understatement. Steven Brown (vocalist, clarinetist, saxophonist, keyboarder), Peter Principle (bassist and producer), Blaine L Reininger (vocalist, violinist, guitarist, laptop botherer) and Luc van Lieshout (trumpeter) have collectively and separately been responsible for over 100 albums and many various collaborations in the worlds of theatre, film, dance and literature.\n\nTheir latest effort, the 52 minute 8 track album, ?Vapour Trail? see?s the four-piece in total synergy as they embark on a hazy, smoke-filled journey into sonic-oblivion which is so contemporary it can be called ?futuristic?. The multi-dimensional sound on this disc is fraught with thick and heavy atmospheric ambience which sucks the listener deep into another dimension. Within this lush 3D dimension, motifs as diverse as deep-fried guitar psychedelica, electro-acoustic noodlings, slow and melancholy jazz, cabaret-rock and flamenco float past in a beautifully arranged and totally captivating manner.\n\nOpener, ?Muchos Colores? is an immense body of music which sees slowly-spoken and slightly sinister Spanish vocals sung over a heady and growingly prominent fusion of spaghetti-western motiffs and dark, foreboding jazzscapes. ?Big Olive? takes the Mexican-cowboy soundtrack influence and injects a buoyant jazz-punkrock fusion backdrop to create a sound which is not only ?space-age? but deeply rooted in genres of the 60?s/70?s .\n\nLike other innovative artists such as Supersilent, Tuxedomoon are adept at moving the concept of traditional jazz into new and exciting realms. With ?Kubrick?, Tuxedomoon create an incredibly unnerving and highly-textured jazz-tinged soundscape which sounds like a contemplative Wayne Shorter jamming over thick slabs of dark ambience and unsettling choral chants. ?Dark Temple? sees the elements of emotional lounge-jazz deconstructed and brought to life within a murky, slowly-bubbling wasteland of dark electro-accoustic ambience. Narrated vocals reminiscent of ?Enablers? kick in after four minute over a soundscape which has now taken on the dynamics of brooding post-rock before exploding into a slow-motion mÃƒÂ©lange of dark jazz and unrestricted electro-acoustic experimentation. As the album progresses, the level of sophistication and invention continues to grow. ?Dizzy? is a remarkably ambitious and busy track which takes experimental Charles Ive?s-esque electro-acoustic motiff?s and uses them as a foundation to a highly charged soundscape of jazz-rock fusion. Elements of the electro-accoustic work start to burst at the seems whilst deep-fried electric-guitar noodlings float past. All the elements start to rise and fuse into each other to create an incredibly ?rocking? and devastatingly intellectual piece.\n\n?Epso Meth Lama? is a progressive and disorientating fusion of choral chanting and jazz-rock played over an ever-growing and spellbinding deep-techno backdrop before moving into a more experimental, outer-space terrain. The closer, ?Wading Into Love? sees the fourpiece engage their unique brand of jazz in a trippy dub-vibe with plenty of Hendrixism?s afoot. Unfortunately, the modern-era King Crimson style vocals don?t really add much value to the track.\n\n?Vapour Trails? is a highly experimental ?futuresound? album which plays around with textural and tonal quality whilst featuring enormous detail and meticulous arrangements. This does not mean that it?s not melodious and that it doesn?t rock because it certainly does. The production values are integral to this as Tuxedomoon create a warm, organ and wide soundstage which creates real cohesion. Tuxedomoon has ultimately created an album which has achieved the great feat of occupying both territories; popular and avant-garde, and as such, ?Vapour Trails? is a highly listenable album which will continue to reward the listener way into the future. ?Vapour Trails? has been released on the 30th anniversary of Tuxedomoon and as part of the celebrations, a limited edition version of this album will be released whilst the band embark on a 17-date European tour.\n\n(Review from experimusic.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f626b85a4fc2ab9ebe332493382f3c8b0393407","amp;dn":"Tuxedomoon+-+Vapour+Trails%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f626b85a4fc2ab9ebe332493382f3c8b0393407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,98,107,133,164,252,42,185,235,227,50,73,51,130,243,200,176,57,52,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
