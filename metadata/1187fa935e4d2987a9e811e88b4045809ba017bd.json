Nastos\n\nIn the proto-typical Scandinavian ECM style of modern jazz oriented music,\npianist Tord Gustavsen follows the path of previous progenitors influenced by\nBill Evans, forged by Keith Jarrett, and extended by the likes of Mike\nNock. This is certainly late-night, nocturnal music, completely reserved and\nrelaxing, ultra-melodic, calm, peaceful, and non-threatening. Rarely does a\ntempo move beyond medium, a dynamic merge above mezzo piano, and any mood goes\nfarther than moderately cool. Well within this consistent timbre, Gustavsen and\nhis trio show a modicum of diversity and influences. Fellow ECM labelmate Bobo\nStenson's style and technique is most extant during the lilting &quot;Edges of\nHappiness,&quot; &quot;Twins&quot; is spiritual, calm, and light but not somber, while &quot;Token\nof Tango&quot; is perfectly representative of its title. &quot;Curtains Aside&quot; mixes march\nrhythm in 6/8 with a regal light funk, the delicate waltz &quot;Being There&quot; is\nreminiscent of &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile,&quot; while darker ballads &quot;Colours of\nMercy&quot; and &quot;Sentiment&quot; sport undoubtedly religious overtones. Gustavsen, while\nplaying laid-back, pristine, pretty, and serene music, is far from challenging\nconvention or pushing the envelope. Conversely, his personal voice is fully\nrealized. Time will tell whether this style finds a worldwide audience, moves\naway from this type of contemporary texture music, or takes the approach he has\nestablished to any more extreme measures, even softer or more forceful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1187fa935e4d2987a9e811e88b4045809ba017bd","amp;dn":"Tord+Gustavsen+Trio+-+The+Ground+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1187fa935e4d2987a9e811e88b4045809ba017bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,135,250,147,94,77,41,135,169,232,17,232,139,64,69,128,155,160,23,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
