The scale of the problem becomes obvious by looking at the global economic loss caused by different kinds of malware, which is estimated to be more than US$ 10 billion every year. Botnets, a special kind of malware, are used to reap economic gains by criminals as well as for politically motivated activities. In contrast to other kinds of malware, botnets utilize a hidden communication channel to receive commands from their operator and communicate their current status. The ability to execute almost arbitrary commands on the infected machines makes botnets a general-purpose tool to perform malicious cyber-activities.\n\nBotnets provides a comprehensive analysis of the topic, and comprises both technical and non-technical sections written by leading cybersecurity experts.\n\nThe non-technical section addresses how botnet infrastructure could be exploited for national security and cybercrime purposes. It approaches the subject as a public policy issue and analyzes the phenomenon of botnets from national security, law enforcement and regulatory policy perspectives, and makes recommendations for policy-makers on different public policies, highlighting the need for international response mechanisms.\n\nThe technical section provides insight into current botnet techniques and discusses state-of-the-art countermeasures to combat the botnet threat in detail. It includes new detection methods as well as different approaches to actively compromise running botnets.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf2cd10a2c6e18f80fe56a44116f40225231a30","amp;dn":"Botnets+%28Springer+Briefs+in+Cybersecurity%29+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf2cd10a2c6e18f80fe56a44116f40225231a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,242,205,16,162,198,225,143,128,254,86,164,65,22,244,2,37,35,26,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
