For that matter neither was the 5.1 because it's too muddy and has shit separation.  Everything is in all channels, so it's no good for isolating instruments.  The quad mix, however, is great for doing this and is a major source for a lot of this.\n\nSpeak To Me:  The 1975 screen film mix, edited and with additional voice elements.  \n\nBreathe:  The 1972 Parsons mix but with portions of the slide guitar cranked up and panned (taken from the quad mix).  We prefer the 1972 version because the slide and the harmony vocals are louder.  \n\nThe Travel Sequence:  EQd to match a bit better (less high mids and super low bass) and the end section is looped in a couple spots to have room for a slower fade out.  A couple of noises are added in from the unused parts of the 1974 Speak To Me screen film.\n\nOn The Run: Begins with the screen film mix, but somewhat rearranged and with the channel balance altered, then segues into a mix of the quad version and the Live At Pompeii outtake.\n\nTime:  The screen film mix at the start, the 5.1 mix with the DVD menu added in for the intro, then the quad mix with the guitar and organ turned up for the rest of the song. The guitar solo was isolated from the 5.1 mix and pasted over the quad mix to make it stereo yet retain the loud backing instruments.  The BG vox during Rick's vocal parts are turned up, and without the wishy-washy effects.  \n\nBreathe (reprise):  Continuation of the mix from Time with the rhythm instruments up louder.\n\nThe Great Gig In The Sky:  Clare's unused vocals found on The Record Producers were special added to the intro.  The spoken voices were isolated from the quad mix and added back into the mix, but with echo added.  The NASA Apollo tape from the Parsons mix was isolated and added to this mix as well, but with heavy effects added.  The part where the final chord changes tuning/speed was altered so that it doesn't go up in pitch like normally, but rater goes down slightly.\n\nMoney:  The extended change sounds from the screen film now overlap  GGitS as in the live versions of the day.  Many extended parts and louder guitar parts are evident.  The end voice collage is also louder.\n\nUs And Them:  A rather complex mix of many versions of the song, with extra sax parts, louder BG vocals, and several piano solos at once.\n\nAny Colour You Like:  A new intro section followed by a mix with previously unheard guitar and keyboard parts.\n\nBrain Damage:  The 5.1 mix with the center channel cranked up to bring one guitar track up more.  Synth riff at the start from ASotM.  Lead guitar from Pompeii throughout.\n\nEclipse:  5.1 mix with the back channels boosted to bring up the girls.  A couple extra vocals added from the DVD menu.  &quot;There is no dark side of the moon really...&quot; dubbed in from ASotM over the heartbeat from the screen films.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a fan-made release for fans and should not be used by any stinky, greedy bootlegger to make money with other peopleÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs work.\nIf you like this release we at MQR urge you to buy the original album, in case you donÃ¢â‚¬Ëœt have it already. If you have it already (and seriously, who doesn't own a copy of Dark Side of the Moon?), we recommend to buy the 2011 remaster as well, because it really sounds awesome.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130aab3d96d424cca6b594432fd828366315028f","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Power+of+the+Dark+Side+-+The+40th+Anniversary+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130aab3d96d424cca6b594432fd828366315028f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,10,171,61,150,212,36,204,166,181,148,67,47,216,40,54,99,21,2,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
