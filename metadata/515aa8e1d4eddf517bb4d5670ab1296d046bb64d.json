Classically trained on the piano, San instead put his fingers to work on a pair of Technics 1200s starting in the late '80s. He was a college pub DJ and bedroom turntable manipulator for nearly a decade before landing a recording deal with U.K. experimental hip-hop duo Coldcut's Ninja Tune imprint in 1997.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Strat Hear\n02.Basin Street Blues\n03.Radio Nufonia\n04.Stompin' At Le Savoi\n05.Space Cadet 2\n06.Grandmaphone Speaks\n07.Skanky Panky\n08.Flu Season\n09.Robochacha\n10.Elevator Hopper\n11.Annie's Parlor\n12.Bonus Materials On The Set Of Fender Bender\n13.More Dance Music\n14.Vacation Island\n15.Negatron Speaks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:515aa8e1d4eddf517bb4d5670ab1296d046bb64d","amp;dn":"Kid+Koala+-+Some+Of+My+Best+Friends+Are+DJ%5C%27s+%282003%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"515aa8e1d4eddf517bb4d5670ab1296d046bb64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,90,168,225,212,237,223,81,123,180,213,103,10,177,41,109,4,107,182,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
