With less space in urban areas we are building higher and faster than ever before. But for these skyscrapers it's not just building big that count- it's thinking big. These skyscrapers are pushing the limits of engineering, technology and design to become greener, stronger, smarter and more luxurious than their predecessors. All are destined to become the celebrity giants of the future. Super Skyscrapers (4 x 60') follows the creation of four extraordinary skyscrapers showcasing how they will revolutionize the way we live, work and how we protect ourselves from potential threats, both from the environment and terrorist attacks. Each episode follows the rise of an individual skyscraper and their pursuit to be the very pinnacle in security, design, opulence and height. Their ambitions are great, but the risks are even greater- girder sized nerves of steel are required to turn these dreams into reality and it's the high stakes at play that set these giants apart from any other high-rise. Filmed over the course of a year, each episode follows the rise of a single skyscraper during a crucial timeframe in their construction period. With unprecedented access to the build process, Superskyscrapers goes behind the scenes of construction to show these iconic landmarks in the making. A host of architects, designers and engineers reveal the over-riding ambitions of each building and the colossal challenges that lie on the journey from conception to completion.\n\n\n1)  One World Trade Center \nOne World Trade Center, the tallest building in the western hemisphere and a famous modern landmark, is engineered to be the safest and strongest skyscraper ever built. This episode follows the final year of exterior construction, culminating with the milestone of reaching the symbolic height of 1,776 feet. For head of construction Steve Plate, as well as scientists, engineers, ironworkers and curtain wall installers, this is a construction job suffused with the history of the site and a sense of duty to rebuild from the ashes of Ground Zero.\n\n2)  Building the Future \nCommonly known as &quot;the cheese grater,&quot; the Leadenhall Building is the pinnacle of London's avant-garde architecture. Designed as a tapered tower with a steel exoskeleton, it's the tallest skyscraper in the City of London and the most innovative. The teams behind the Leadenhall project had to radically rethink every aspect of the traditional building model. This program follows the monumental challenges that come with erecting this super skyscraper: it will be constructed off-site, delivered to location, and stacked and bolted together like a giant Lego set.\n\n3)  The Vertical City \nShanghai Tower isn't just a skyscraper - it's a vertical city, a collection of businesses, services and hotels all in one place, fitting a population the size of Monaco into a footprint the size of a football field. Within its walls, residents can literally work, rest, play and relax in public parks, looking up through 12 stories of clear space. Not just one, however, but eight of them, stacked on top of each other, all the way to the 120th floor. When complete, the structure will dominate Shanghai's skyline, towering over its neighbours as a testament to China's economic success and the ambitions of the city's wealthy elite.\n\n4)  The Billionaire Building \nUpon completion, One57, on Manhattan's 57th Street, will rise more than 1,000 feet, making it the tallest residential tower in the western hemisphere and boasting spectacular views of Central Park. &quot;One57&quot; follows the teams tasked with creating New York's most luxurious residential skyscraper and their ambition to redefine luxury living the big city. Condominiums at One57 showcase state-of-the-art interiors - double-height ceilings, full-floor apartments, bathrooms clad in the finest Italian marble and the finest material finishes.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1240/7db6.jpg&quot;
