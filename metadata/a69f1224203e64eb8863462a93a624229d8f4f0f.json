Since forming in 2007, they have opened for artists like The Black Keys (SXSW 2009), The Black Angels, Dead Meadow etc.\n\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocalist, Will Kelly is hauntingly reminiscent of Jim Morrison with his gravelly, boozy vocals and so is the sexual undertone of most of their songs, and occasionally, ends up sounding like Glenn Danzig on the dead end of the night. Searing riffs evoke the late 60s acid-head era and exits in a superb, fuzzed and reverb-heavy sonic atmosphere.\n\nThe Flying Eyes also produce a grass-roots music festival called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Farm FestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Manchester, Maryland. In November 2009, The Flying Eyes released a compilation of their two EPs, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad BloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“WinterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ under World In Sound Records. In the summer of 2010 they supported the album with a six week European tour, notably sharing the main stage of the Burg Herzberg Festival in Germany with legends Hawkwind and Jeff Beck.
