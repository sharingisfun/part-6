And he was murdered to keep it all secret. \r\n\r\nExamining the shadows and cracks between Americaâ€™s official version of history, Xaviant Haze and Paul Schrag propose that the America of old taught in schools is not the America that was discovered by Lewis and Clark and other early explorers. Investigating the discoveries of Spanish conquistadors and Olmec stories of contact with European-like natives, the authors uncover evidence of explorers from Europe and Asia prior to Columbus, sophisticated ancient civilizations in North America and the Caribbean, the fountain of youth, and a long-extinct race of giants. Verifying stories from Lewisâ€™s journals with modern archaeological finds, geological studies, 18th- and 19th-century newspapers, and accounts of the world in the days of Columbus, the authors reveal how Lewis and Clarkâ€™s finds infuriated powerful interests in Washington--including the Smithsonian Institution--culminating in the murder of Meriwether Lewis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6776d70801506b60e7e11a26fa1cbd4ffd53d8","amp;dn":"Paul+Schrag+-+The+Suppressed+History+of+America+-+The+Murder+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6776d70801506b60e7e11a26fa1cbd4ffd53d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,103,118,215,8,1,80,107,96,231,225,26,38,250,28,189,79,253,83,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
