Though the album runs only around 37 minutes, Krug described the album as &quot;dense, but in a satisfying way, I hope, like eating a small, heavy piece of cheesecake.&quot; Also included in this torrent are Dreamland EP: Marimba and Shit-Drums, a 20-minute track released in early 2010, and &quot;The Way You Wish You Could Live in the Storm,&quot; an eight-and-a-half-minute bonus track being given away for free on Moonface's website which does not appear on the album itself. Enjoy and seed!\n\n1. Return to the Violence of the Ocean Floor (7:16)\n2. Whale Song (Song Instead of a Kiss) (8:04)\n3. Fast Peter (8:02)\n4. Shit-Hawk in the Snow (7:28)\n5.
