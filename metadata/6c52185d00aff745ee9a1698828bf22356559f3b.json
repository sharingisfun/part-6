Despite the description, theyâ€™re not to be mistaken for part of the post- Mumford crowd of jamboree makers. Rather, Israel Nebeker and group have stayed anchored to a more reflective, singer/songwriter aesthetic during the five years since 2011â€™s We Are the Tide. \r\nStill operating as six-piece, And Then Like Lions also shares that albumâ€™s efficient arrangements, which only occasionally sound like a band of that size. Written by Nebeker in the aftermath of a series of personal traumas, including the breakup of a 13-year romantic relationship and the death of his father (artist Royal Nebeker), the material is, if anything, even less poppy here. \r\nReserved in every way but melodically, â€œUmpqua Rushingâ€ opens the record with a slow build of varied acoustic and electric members of the guitar family, quiet electronics, and percussion. Inspired by a scenic region of Oregon and how memories and emotion can be tied to a place, itâ€™s an elegant opener, one that signals whatâ€™s to come. Another nature-themed entry, â€œMoon at Dawn,â€ has the albumâ€™s haziest atmosphere, with layers of sustained guitars, backing vocals, horns, and even vibraphone. A brighter selection is â€œPacked Powder,â€ with rich vocal harmonies and livelier rhythms that are mirrored later on â€œWhich Side Iâ€™m On.â€ The hopeful campfire ballad â€œDonâ€™t Doubtâ€ is another track that, though affecting in its own way, balances the tone of the more somber songs. Album standout â€œWhat Is Yetâ€ has an over-one-minute-long orchestral intro that leads into a bluesy lament. Both an acoustic guitar-and-banjo tune and a fully arranged chamber piece with strings and horns, it shows what the group has in reserve. The sparser songs here have everything they need, however, and thatâ€™s the albumâ€™s most impressive feat, even topping memorable melodies: a feeling of stability in the territory of loss. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Umpqua Rushing.flac \r\n02 - Joik #3.flac \r\n03 - Moon at Dawn.flac \r\n04 - Packed Powder.flac \r\n05 - Don't Doubt.flac \r\n06 - Seeing Is Believing.flac \r\n07 - Which Side I'm On.flac \r\n08 - It Was Enough.flac \r\n09 - What Is Yet.flac \r\n10 - Like Lions.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: Indie-Folk \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report: \r\nSource : CD \r\nFormat : FLAC \r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \r\nBit rate mode : Variable \r\nBit rate : ~823-945 Kbps \r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels \r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c52185d00aff745ee9a1698828bf22356559f3b","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Blind+Pilot+-+And+Then+Like+Lions+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c52185d00aff745ee9a1698828bf22356559f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,82,24,93,0,175,247,69,238,154,22,152,130,139,242,35,86,85,159,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
