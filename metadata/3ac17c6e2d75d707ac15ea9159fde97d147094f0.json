Forests and cities will burn. Tremendous magical forces will level entire castles in the blink of an eye. Four immortal sibling monarchs are locked in a massive campaign to rule the land of Darien. Build your armies, hone your magic skills and gather resources to wage war on an epic field of battle. The balance of power lies in your arms.\n\nThe Iron Plague expansion set\n\nThe premise of the sequel continued the storyline of the lost father of magic, Garacaius. Believing that magic was a source of conflict, Garacaius fled his kingdom and founded a new empire based on science and engineering, as opposed to magic. This new empire, Creon, quickly dominated the neighboring provinces and absorbed the knowledge of their conquests. Garacaius himself died, but the elected ruler of Creon (in a steam-powered robotic suit) eventually led the kingdom on a crusade against magic and the magical sibling rulers of Darien. The expansion pack added an entirely new faction to the game (the science and engineering kingdom of Creon), as well as hundreds of new maps and entirely new graphics for map tile sets.\nok I realized I had not only a double folder included, but I was also missing a track. *el sigh* this has been a VERY long night for me. I deeply apologize for the error. Heres is the fix.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP or Windows Vista, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\n\nInstall and Play\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac17c6e2d75d707ac15ea9159fde97d147094f0","amp;dn":"Total+Annihilation%3A+Kingdoms+%2B+Expansion+Gog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac17c6e2d75d707ac15ea9159fde97d147094f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,193,124,110,45,117,215,7,172,21,234,145,89,253,233,125,20,112,148,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
