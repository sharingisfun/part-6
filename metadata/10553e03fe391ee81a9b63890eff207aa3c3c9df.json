The film opens with young gangster Wah (Andy Lau) getting a visit for the day from his beautiful cousin Ah-Ngor (Maggie Cheung), who is coming into Kowloon from the remote outlying Lantau island to receive medical treatment for a lung condition. At first, the short-fused gangster and the quiet country girl have little in common, but gradually the two start to form a bond of sorts. Meanwhile, Wah&amp;#039;s buddy Fly (Jacky Cheung), who has an absolutely volcanic temper, is always getting Wah into hot water. Even though Wah knows that Fly is bound to end up dead soon, he stands by his foolhardy friend. After some hesitation, Wah -- who has fallen for Ah-Ngor -- visits his cousin on Lantau, hoping to make their relationship more than family. Fly later infuriates a psychopathic mob boss, Tony (Alex Man Chi-leung who, along with his henchmen, beats and degrades Fly and Wah. This induces Fly make amends with Tony by undertaking the outrageously difficult task of rubbing out an informant who is in the custody of the cops, before the man has the opportunity to testify in a court hearing. \nJonathan Crow\n\nA Voice from IMDB\n\nTwo superstars who dominated the Hong Kong art movies in 90&amp;#039;s were produced by this movie, Kar-Wai Wong and Maggie Cheung, although to a large extent &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; is a commercial movie. Maggie Cheung has said it was the first time she knew acting was something beyond making simple expression. Before &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, she was a &quot;vase&quot; rather than a professional actress. The story talks about two gangsters and their friendship. Very typical style of Hong Kong gangster movies. But with a good script and a good director, the movie is indeed very watchable. Wong made the movie visually very attractive. The camera movement and angle are remarkable and in fact have showed the style we can see later in Wong&amp;#039;s &quot;Chungking Express&quot;(1994). Equally outstanding is the description to the characters especially the one played by Jacky Cheung - a loser who are willing to give up his life in order to obtain a very short-term respect. All the actors performed very well. The style is very different from that of other gangster movies. May not be better than, but at least equally watchable as &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; of John Woo and absolutely a movie worth seeing.\n\nFile Name .............: Wong Kar-Wai - Wong gok ka moon AKA As Tears Go By (1988).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 734,466,048 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 1:38:39 (4190184 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nFrame Size ............: 640x352[=1.818]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 817 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.151 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: []...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 175 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
