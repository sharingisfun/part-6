At the end of the tour, Scorpions lead guitarist Michael Schenker was asked to fill an open position as UFO's guitarist and accepted the role. Schenker's departure temporarily resulted in the breakup of the band but Rudolf Schenker and later Klaus Meine ultimately merged with the band Dawn Road which consisted of guitarist Ulrich Roth filling Michael's role, as well as drummer JÃƒÂ¼rgen Rosenthal, and bass guitarist Francis Buchholz. The new line up resumed under the Scorpions name and recorded Fly to the Rainbow.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Speedy's Coming&quot;   \tRudolf Schenker, Klaus Meine \t3:36\n2. \t&quot;They Need a Million&quot;   \tR.
