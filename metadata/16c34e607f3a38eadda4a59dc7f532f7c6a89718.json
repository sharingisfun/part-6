It documents the making of the original Star Wars trilogy: Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983) and their impact on popular culture.\n\nThe two and a half hour long documentary was made for the bonus disc of the DVD boxset of the Star Wars Trilogy, released on September 21, 2004. A shortened version of the documentary premiered on the A&amp;E Network later that fall. The TV version ran at around ninety minutes, cutting out nearly an hour of content.\n\nThe documentary is strictly chronological, divided into five parts, from the beginning of George Lucas' career as a filmmaker, to the complicated production of Star Wars in 1976, to the impact the film, and its sequels, have made on the world today. It features interviews with George Lucas and major cast and crewmembers. The documentary puts Star Wars into a sociological and political perspective by using interviews with spectators such as Walter Cronkite.\n\nThe film was shot in 1.78:1 aspect ratio.\n\nVersions\nThe original cut of the documentary ran at around two hours and forty minutes.\nIt was cut down to around two and a half hours, with only ten minutes cut. This final version was released as the main feature on the bonus disc of the 2004 DVD release of the original Star Wars Trilogy.\nA shortened version of the documentary premiered on the A&amp;E network in late 2004. This version ran at around ninety minutes, cutting out nearly an hour of content.\n\nDeleted content\nIn the original cut of the film, a ten minute segment was included which elaborated on The Star Wars Holiday Special and Lucas seeing a mistake in not holding full control over the Star Wars franchise. The part was cut, however, because, according to the producers, &quot;it just didn't fit with the pacing of the film.&quot;\n\nNotable exclusions\nAny mention of the Emperor, played by Ian McDiarmid.\nAny mention of Sebastian Shaw, playing the unmasked Darth Vader.\nAny mention of The Star Wars Holiday Special. As noted above, there was going to be a 10 minute section covering it, but it was cut due to pacing issues.\nAny interview with David Prowse (Darth Vader).\nAny mention of Mark Hamill's car accident in January 1977 that caused him untreatable face damages in long-term.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c34e607f3a38eadda4a59dc7f532f7c6a89718","amp;dn":"Empire+of+Dreams+-+The+Story+of+the+Star+Wars+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c34e607f3a38eadda4a59dc7f532f7c6a89718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,195,78,96,127,58,56,234,221,164,165,157,199,245,50,247,198,168,151,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
