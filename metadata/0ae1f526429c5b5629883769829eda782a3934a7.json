This  book is  a\ncompact  account  of the  basic  features  of probability  and  random\nprocesses  at  the   level  of  first  and   second  year  mathematics\nundergraduates and Masters' students in cognate fields. It is suitable\nfor a first  course in probability, plus a follow-up  course in random\nprocesses including Markov chains.\n\nA special feature  is the authors' attention  to rigorous mathematics:\nnot everything  is rigorous, but the  need for rigour is  explained at\ndifficult  junctures.  The  text  is  enriched  by  simple  exercises,\ntogether with problems (with very brief hints) many of which are taken\nfrom final examinations at Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nThe first eight chapters form a  course in basic probability, being an\naccount of events, random variables,  and distributions - discrete and\ncontinuous  random variables  are treated  separately -  together with\nsimple versions  of the  law of  large numbers  and the  central limit\ntheorem.  There  is an  account  of  moment generating  functions  and\ntheir applications.  The following three chapters  are about branching\nprocesses, random walks, and  continuous-time random processes such as\nthe Poisson process.  The final chapter is a  fairly extensive account\nof Markov chains in discrete time.\n\n\n\nThis second edition develops the  success of the first edition through\nan updated presentation,  the extensive new chapter  on Markov chains,\nand a number  of new sections to ensure comprehensive  coverage of the\nsyllabi at major universities.\n\n\nContents\n========\n\nPART I: Basic Probability\n 1.

Random Processes in Continuous Time\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nGeoffrey  Grimmett  is Professor  of  Mathematical  Statistics at  the\nUniversity of Cambridge and Master  of Downing College, Cambridge. His\nreserach  interests  lie  in disordered  physical  systems,  including\npercolation and  related processes.  He has written  numerous research\narticles in probability  theory and statistical mechanics,  as well as\nthree research books  and two successful textbooks  on probability and\nrandom processes at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\n\nDominic  Welsh held  the John  von  Neumann Professorship  at Bonn  in\n1990-91, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Oxford in 1993.\nHis research  interests include  combinatorics and  complexity theory,\nand  he has  written more  than a  hundred papers  in these  areas. He\nretired  from Oxford  University  in  2005, and  has  since then  held\nvisiting positions in New Zealand and Barcelona.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae1f526429c5b5629883769829eda782a3934a7","amp;dn":"Probability%3A+An+Introduction+%282e%29+-+Grimmet+and+Welsh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae1f526429c5b5629883769829eda782a3934a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,225,245,38,66,156,91,86,41,136,55,105,130,158,218,120,42,57,52,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
