She has three albums that have been certified Platinum or Gold, and she has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of Rock 'n' Roll&quot; many times during her career. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 2010\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a compilation album by the rock group Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, released March 9, 2010 through Jett's label Blackheart Records.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; (from Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth, 1984; originally performed by The Runaways)\nJoan Jett, Kim Fowley\n2:33\n2.\t&quot;You Drive Me Wild&quot; (originally performed by The Runaways)\tJett\t3:52\n3.\t&quot;School Days&quot; (originally performed by The Runaways)\tJett, Fowley\t3:02\n4.\t&quot;Love Is Pain&quot; \tJett, Laguna\t3:29\n5.\t&quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (from Bad Reputation, 1981)\nJett, Laguna, Ritchie Cordell, Marty Joe Kupersmith\t2:47\n6.\t&quot;You Don't Know What You've Got&quot; (from Bad Reputation, 1981)\tJett, Laguna, Cordell\t3:42\n7.\t&quot;I Want You&quot; (from Notorious, 1991)\nJett, Laguna, Cordell\t2:42\n8.\t&quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; (from I Love Rock 'n' Roll, 1981; originally performed by Arrows)\nJake Hooker, Alan Merrill\n2:55\n9.\t&quot;(I'm Gonna) Run Away&quot; (from I Love Rock 'n' Roll, 1981)\tJett, Laguna\t2:28\n10.\t&quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; (from I Love Rock 'n' Roll, 1981; originally performed by Tommy James and the Shondells)\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)&quot; (from Bad Reputation, 1981; originally performed by Gary Glitter)\nGary Glitter, Mike Leander\n3:43\n2.\t&quot;The French Song&quot; (from Album, 1983)\nJett, Laguna, Robert Byrd, Mike Winter, Jr.\t3:35\n3.\t&quot;Everyday People&quot; (from Album, 1983; originally performed by Sly &amp; the Family Stone)\nSly Stone\n2:39\n4.\t&quot;Fake Friends&quot; (from Album, 1983)\tJett, Laguna\t3:16\n5.\t&quot;Light of Day&quot; \nBruce Springsteen\n3:31\n6.\t&quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot; (from Up Your Alley, 1988)\tJett, Desmond Child\n4:07\n7.\t&quot;Backlash&quot; (from Notorious, 1991)\tJett, Laguna, Paul Westerberg\n3:29\n8.\t&quot;Activity Grrrl&quot; (from Pure and Simple, 1994)\nJett, Laguna\t3:27\n9.\t&quot;Love Is All Around&quot; (from Great Hits, 1997; originally performed by Sonny Curtis)\nSonny Curtis\t1:00\n10.\t&quot;Androgynous&quot; (from Sinner, 2006; originally performed by The Replacements)\nWesterberg\t3:08\n11.\t&quot;A.C.D.C.&quot; (from Sinner, 2006; originally performed by Sweet)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94c98839a977272da74351d54069f42ee50e10d","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+and+Blackhearts+-+Greatest+Hits+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94c98839a977272da74351d54069f42ee50e10d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,76,152,131,154,151,114,114,218,116,53,29,84,6,159,66,238,80,225,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
