For my third game upload I bring you the infamous HALO 2\n...................................................................................You can get this game to work on XP so I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bother making a XP workaround.\n\nInstructions: (I figured you would be smart enough to un-rar it.)\n\n1. You must first goto the OPEN ME FIRST! folder.\n\n2. Goto the CRACK folder.\n\n3. Double click and install the registry file: RUN THIS FIRST.\n\n4. Goto C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Windows and right click on the System32 folder\nand click Take Ownership.\n\n5. Once that is done copy MF.dll and paste it in the System32\nfolder.  Overwrite the old one.\n  - If it tells you the file is open somewhere you will need to rename\nthe ORIGINAL MF.dll to something random and move it to your\ndesktop.  After doing so paste the crack!\n\n6. Install Game for Windows Live and then install vcredit.\n\n7. Once that is done you are all set.  Just start the game and\nMAKE SURE you create a OFFLINE account.  If you have a\nupdated GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE it WILL NOT WORK\nso uninstall games for windows live.  Though LIVE and all that\ngood stuff are NOT faded out you still CANNOT play online so\ndon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even try.\n\nENJOY!!!\n\nSeed and comment on how I did.  I fully tested this on both 32 and 64 bit Windows 7 computers.  So if you have and issue you did something wrong so re-do the instructions above.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95de672c3fae05a8ec3386192a2dfc60f998c81","amp;dn":"Halo+2+%28Vista+and+7%29+Direct+Play+%2ATyMod%2A+Fully+Working","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95de672c3fae05a8ec3386192a2dfc60f998c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,93,230,114,195,250,224,90,142,195,56,97,146,162,223,198,15,153,140,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
