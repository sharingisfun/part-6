Over the course of 12 days, our 'recruits' are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits by battle-hardened veterans from the world's toughest Special Forces, from the Navy Seals to the British SAS.\r\nBased on the special forces' selection methods, every 48 hours the recruits are put through a set of challenges, each one designed to break them down and every one more difficult than the last. In the end there can only be one winner of Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Russian Spetznaz \r\nAfter surviving the first four brutal training courses, the ten remaining recruits are about to enter a more psychologically challenging phase - the world of the Russian Spetznaz Special Forces, under the authority of veteran Sonny. With only 6 places available in next week's grand final, the recruits will have to draw on every ounce of their depleted reserves to make it through 48 hours of rigorous mental and physical testing. From carrying heavy weights for miles through the gruelling hills of south Wales to having their wits tested under extreme mental endurance, the recruits will be marked down for the smallest mistake and any weakness shown could mean not making it to the final. Who will be in the final 6?\r\n\r\n6)  British SAS \r\nThey have survived the initiation programmes of five of the world's toughest army units. Now, for the final, the remaining six recruits will face the ultimate test - 48 hours with the British SAS. Few are chosen and even fewer can pass the intense mental and physical challenges that must be endured and triumphed over to stand a hope of being selected for this most elite of forces. But at the end there can only be one winner. Who has what it takes to take the title of Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3006 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b069ccw0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b57e088f1672d8c761fc7c10761b61866da479e9","amp;dn":"BBC+Special+Forces+Ultimate+Hell+Week+5of6+Russian+Spetznaz+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b57e088f1672d8c761fc7c10761b61866da479e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,126,8,143,22,114,216,199,97,252,124,16,118,27,97,134,109,164,121,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
