Is the skyscraper a blot on the landscape, or the answer to the national housing crisis? Dan is in Bow in east London, charting the extraordinary history of one estate - the Lincoln. Designed in 1960 for the London County Council by a young idealistic architect, the 19-storey Lincoln was once the tallest residential building in London. Inside every flat were the latest space-age gadgets - a lift, a shower and a fitted kitchen. But the dream turned sour. The Lincoln became notorious for drugs and violence. There was even a brutal murder. It was the same all over Britain - the flat was a byword for deprivation and social exclusion. But then, just as everything looked lost, the Lincoln was saved and with, perhaps, the hopes of an entire generation for that most precious of things - a home. For Dan, as perhaps for Britain, 'the only way is up'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen14.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2860 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.24 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c5zj1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e901bdb13435f3c6e94b51fdf02cb4ba3246069a","amp;dn":"Dan+Cruickshank+At+Home+With+The+British+3of3+The+Flat+720p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e901bdb13435f3c6e94b51fdf02cb4ba3246069a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,1,189,177,52,53,243,198,233,75,81,253,240,44,180,186,50,70,6,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
