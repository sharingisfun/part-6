The game\n    needs to be fully updated (Mass.Effect.3.Citadel.DLC-RELOADED\n    includes all the updates).\n     \n    About DLC:\n    Genesis 2 fills the role of Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2\n    for new players to the series, introducing them to the\n    story of the first two games in the Mass Effect trilogy\n    and allowing them to make some of the major plot decisions\n    that players could make by playing through the previous\n    games (see Save File Transfer). The player is prompted to\n    begin Genesis 2 after character creation, but using it is\n    optional. There are two versions of the comic, one each\n    for a male and female Commander Shepard.\n     \n     \n      1. Install this minor DLC (thanks EA).\n      2.
