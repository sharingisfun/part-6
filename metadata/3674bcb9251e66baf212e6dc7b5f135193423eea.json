He has successfully juggled every storytelling ball, character, atmosphere, prose, pace and plot, with the skill and assuredness of a veteran novelist at the top of his game. The writing is haunting and quotable, the twists expertly placed and infinitely plausible, the conjured locations vivid and memorable, the characters full of depth and promise. You can read the book as a game of cat and mouse, a ride of chilling suspense, or a literary repast, since it provides all in abundance. \n\nIn the novel the set-up provides an intriguing dilemma. A man gets a letter that scares him to death by challenging him to think of a number. That catalyst soon speeds the reader and VerdonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hero, Dave Gurney, a legendary and now retired NYPD detective, headlong into a mystery of the first order. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m pretty adept at figuring out these types of stories and while I hit on a few twists before Verdon probably wanted me to, the major ones were stunning surprises. I read the last two-hundred pages in one sitting. I did this for two compelling reasons. First, to find out what the hell was going on. And second, just to enjoy the wonderful writing. Some novelists promise plot and pace and deliver it with lightweight characters and silly dialogue. Others get the characters spot-on but the story is mediocre and predictable. Verdon nails it all in his first novel. The villain is appealingly terrifying, smart and cunning while operating mostly in absentia, \nand that is incredibly difficult to accomplish. The answer behind the THINK OF A NUMBER plot, most certainly a disaster in lesser hands, proves clever, winning and eminently believable. VerdonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s protagonist Dave Gurney is one for the ages, and readers everywhere will surely clamor to see this man again. Think of a Number gets full marks from me. And I think it will from you, too. Enjoy. - David Baldacci\n\n\n_____________________________________Contents____________________________________\n\nTitle Page\n\nDedication\n\nPrologue\n\nPart One - Fatal Memories\nChapter 1 - Cop Art\nChapter 2 - A Perfect Victim\nChapter 3 - Trouble in Paradise\nChapter 4 - I Know You So Well I Know What You\\'re Thinking\nChapter 5 - Unpleasant Possibilities\nChapter 6 - For Blood That\\'s as Red as a Painted Rose\nChapter 7 - The Black Hole\nChapter 8 - A Rock and a Hard Place\nChapter 9 - No Such Person\nChapter 10 - The Perfect Place\nChapter 11 - A Unique Ministry\nChapter 12 - The Importance of Honesty\nChapter 13 - Nothing to be Guilty About\nChapter 14 - Commitment\nChapter 15 - Dichotomies\nChapter 16 - The End of the Beginning\n\nPart Two - Macabre Games\nChapter 17 - Quite a Lot of Blood\nChapter 18 - Footprints to Nowhere\nChapter 19 - Scum of the Earth\nChapter 20 - A Family Friend\nChapter 21 - Priorities\nChapter 22 - Getting it Straight\nChapter 23 - Without a Trace\nChapter 24 - Crime of the Year\nChapter 25 - Questioning Gurney\nChapter 26 - A Blank Check\nChapter 27 - Getting to Know the DA\nChapter 28 - Back to the Scene of the Crime\nChapter 29 - Backwards\nChapter 29 - Backwards\nChapter 30 - Emerald Cottage\nChapter 31 - A Routine Call From the Bronx\n\nPart Three - Back to the Beginning\nChapter 32 - The Cleansing to Come\nChapter 33 - A Hell of a Night\nChapter 34 - A Dark Day\nChapter 35 - Stumbling Into the Light\nChapter 36 - One Thing Leads to Another\nChapter 37 - Bad Things Come in Threes\nChapter 38 - A DiÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¼cult Man\nChapter 39 - You and I Have a Date, Mr. 658\nChapter 40 - A Shot in the Dark\nChapter 41 - Back to the Real World\nChapter 42 - Upside Down\nChapter 43 - Madeleine\nChapter 44 - Final Arguments\nChapter 45 - To Rest in Peace, Act Now\nChapter 46 - A Simple Plan\nChapter 47 - Welcome to Wycherly\nChapter 48 - A House with a History\nChapter 49 - Kill them All\nChapter 50 - Re-Search\nChapter 51 - Show-and-Tell\nChapter 52 - Death Before Dawn\nChapter 53 - Ending, Beginning\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCopyright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3674bcb9251e66baf212e6dc7b5f135193423eea","amp;dn":"John+Verdon+-+Think+Of+A+Number%3A+A+Novel+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3674bcb9251e66baf212e6dc7b5f135193423eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,116,188,185,37,30,102,186,242,18,230,220,123,95,19,81,147,66,62,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
