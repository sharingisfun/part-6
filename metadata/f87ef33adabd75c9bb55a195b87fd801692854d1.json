The more obvious touchstone, at least on their second album, which reached No 1 in Australia, is the California-dreaming stratum of 1970s rock. The opening trinity of Southern Sun, Old Town Blues and the title track, in fact, are clearly lost out-takes from Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or may as well be. That's how precisely they've nailed the tequila-sunrise mellowness, which acts as a gateway to an albumful of emollient soft rock. It's seductive stuff, pushing all the right wistfulness/optimism buttons and allowing the songs time to flow to a leisurely conclusion. One song ends in a brave skirl of Kenny G-style sax Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that's how committed they are. Vocalist Dave Hosking is a moving purveyor of precarious emotional states Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his bleakness on Bridges, a dream/nightmare memoir of their first American tour, is genuinely painful. End of the Line, by the way, dips a toe into folky diddlement you could call Mumfordian, but it's easy to skip....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87ef33adabd75c9bb55a195b87fd801692854d1","amp;dn":"Boy+%26amp%3B+Bear+-+Harlequin+Dream+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2CLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87ef33adabd75c9bb55a195b87fd801692854d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,126,243,58,218,189,117,201,187,85,161,149,184,127,216,1,105,40,84,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
