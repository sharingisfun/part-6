And because a local Emcee has agreed to trade me beats for weed I really need some drum samples pronto! \n\nI decided to start reviving my collection by sampling all of my Boss DR-202 drum machine's drum samples. These are all 44.1khz 24-bit samples. I caputured them by feeding the left output out of the DR-202 (not both, to reduce noise) into a cheap mixer which then is connected to input 1 of my M-audio Delta 44. I recorded every sample into audacity in Ubuntu Studio Linux, use audacity's noise reduction, normalized the volume, and saved each individual drum sample with the name it is given in the DR-202's memory.\n\nI intend to continue making music without windows by using Ardour and Hydrogen together with Jack. Wish me luck!\n\nPlease use these samples and make some good music. I'm tired of shitty music.\n\nLove,\nDankreek!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261244f291357c40e25bfb60341a20b270616bdc","amp;dn":"Boss+DR-202+24-bit+drum+machine+samples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261244f291357c40e25bfb60341a20b270616bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,68,242,145,53,124,64,226,91,251,96,52,26,32,178,112,97,107,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
