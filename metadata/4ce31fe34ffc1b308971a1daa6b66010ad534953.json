I preferred it. First, I am a softy on grading films on Buddhism. This &quot;Way of Life&quot; had no cheesy special effects and used no obvious actors. It looked at the death of an old man in a village in Ladakh, has early footage of the Dalai Lama and a (somewhat) recent interview. Perhaps the best bit was the street interview with local citizens who, unlike most Westerners, are very accepting of death and suffering. Ram Dass and others share their ideas for use of the book in the West. I enjoyed the Tibetan Book of the Dead being read at a Western hospice. Again, a bit basic, but a good introductory piece. The Ladakh scenery, homes, etc. were fascinating when the film plodded along.\n\nPart 1 \n-- \nFile Size: 448 MB (or 459,573 KB or 470,602,752 bytes) \nFile Type: AVI \nVideo Codec 4CC: DX50/DIVX \nVideo Codec Name: DivX 5.0 \nx:y (aspect ratio): 720x404 (1.78:1) [~41:23] \nVideo Bitrate: 1212 kb/s \nFPS (frames/sec): 30.000 \nLength (duration): 00:47:41 (85,842 fr) \nAudio Codec Name: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nAudio Codec &quot;Stat&quot;: 4 compatible codecs installed \nAudio Bitrate: 96 kb/s (48/ch, stereo) CBR \nFs (sample freq): 44100 Hz \nI/L (interleave): 1 vid frame (33 ms) Split: Yes \nIMRR (I/L rate ratio): 1.00 \n&quot;Qf&quot; (&quot;Frame Quality&quot;): 0.139 bits/pixel \n\n-- \n\nPart 2 \n-- \nFile Size: 423 MB (or 434,040 KB or 444,457,472 bytes) \nFile Type: AVI \nVideo Codec 4CC: DX50/DIVX \nVideo Codec Name: DivX 5.0 \nx:y (aspect ratio): 720x404 (1.78:1) [~41:23] \nVideo Bitrate: 1212 kb/s \nFPS (frames/sec): 30.000 \nLength (duration): 00:45:02 (81,056 fr) \nAudio Codec Name: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nAudio Codec &quot;Stat&quot;: 4 compatible codecs installed \nAudio Bitrate: 96 kb/s (48/ch, stereo) CBR \nFs (sample freq): 44100 Hz \nI/L (interleave): 1 vid frame (33 ms) Split: Yes \nIMRR (I/L rate ratio): 1.00 \n&quot;Qf&quot; (&quot;Frame Quality&quot;): 0.139 bits/pixel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce31fe34ffc1b308971a1daa6b66010ad534953","amp;dn":"The+Tibetan+Book+of+the+Dead%3A+A+Way+of+Life+%2F+The+Great+Liberati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce31fe34ffc1b308971a1daa6b66010ad534953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,227,31,227,79,252,27,48,137,113,161,218,166,182,96,16,173,83,73,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
