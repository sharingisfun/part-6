The gate is then dumped into a nearby sun.\n\nFrom those refugees who get through, agent Cormac learns that the Maker civilization has been destroyed by pernicious virus known as the Jain technology. This, of course, raises questions: why was Dragon, a massive biocontruct of the Makers, really sent to the Polity; why did a Jain node suddenly end up in the hands of someone who could do the most damage with it?\n\nMeanwhile an entity called the Legate is distributing pernicious Jain nodes...\n\nAnd a renegade attack ship, The King of Hearts, has encountered something very nasty outside the Polity itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9d49b9de9542487066b6148cebd5a09520fa96","amp;dn":"Neal+Asher+-+Polity+Agent+%28Agent+Cormac+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9d49b9de9542487066b6148cebd5a09520fa96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,157,73,185,222,149,66,72,112,102,182,20,140,235,213,160,149,32,250,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
