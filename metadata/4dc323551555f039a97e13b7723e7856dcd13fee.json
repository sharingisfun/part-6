Amen\n2001 | ISBN: 039914644X, 0425183270 | English | 432 Pages | EPUB | 2.20 MB\n\nCommonly perceived as a flavor-of-the-month diagnosis, ADD is, in fact, an enormous health problem that will only continue to grow. It affects six percent of the population, yet less than one third are taking medication. Why? According to Dr. Amen, attention deficit disorder is underdiagnosed, often incorrectly treated, and poorly understood.\nDr. Amen, board-certified in child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry and licensed in nuclear brain imaging, has discovered that there are six types of ADD- not just the commonly known two. Moreover, the most frequently prescribed treatment- Ritalin- makes four of these types worse. Dr. Amen's discovery results from an intensive, years-long study of brain imaging that has identified the distinctive brain dysfunctions characterizing each type of ADD.
