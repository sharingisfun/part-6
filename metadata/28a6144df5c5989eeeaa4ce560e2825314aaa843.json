Satriani worked with a range of guitarists from several musical genres, including Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Eric Johnson, Larry LaLonde, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brian May, Patrick Rondat, Andy Timmons, Paul Gilbert, Adrian Legg, and Robert Fripp through the annual G3 Jam Concerts. \nHe is currently the lead guitarist for the supergroup Chickenfoot.\n\nHe is heavily influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Jeff Beck, possessing, however, his own easily recognizable style. \nSince 1988, Satriani has been using his own signature guitar, the Ibanez JS Series, which is widely sold in stores. \nHe has a signature series amplifier, the Peavey JSX, signature VOX amPlug headphone amp, and signature VOX pedals The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Satchurator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; distortion pedal, The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Time Machine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; delay pedal, The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Big Bad Wah\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; wah pedal and The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Ice 9\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; overdrive pedal.\n\n\nBlack Swans and Wormhole Wizards is the fourteenth studio album by guitarist Joe Satriani, which was released on October 5, 2010.
