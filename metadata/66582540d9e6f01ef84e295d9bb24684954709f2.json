Some are of them were real - some are altered into pure Legend. These legends usually had somebody doing villainous deeds. The even greater thing is that most of these were surrounded in mystery or conspiracy.\r\nMedieval Murder Mysteries uses modern thinking from historical police criminology combined with forensics and human osteologists blended with current historical ideas to try and solve what really happened all those years ago. Magnificent castles, chivalrous knights, powerful kings and queens? You'll have them. Also require dark deeds, illicit lovers, greedy nobles, mad cardinals? Look no further. They're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Arthur of Brittany: The Boy who Should Have Been King \r\nBad, bad King John - the treacherous brother who tried to take his brother King Richard's throne while he was away fighting during the Crusades. John is something of a pantomime villain these days and his popular image as a selfish, cruel, tyrannical, violent man is largely true, although he was well-read and a capable administrator. But did he personally murder his errant nephew Arthur of Brittany to prevent him from succeeding to the throne of England. It's a great story, shocking if true - but is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1919/medieval-murder-mysteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66582540d9e6f01ef84e295d9bb24684954709f2","amp;dn":"Medieval+Murder+Mysteries+Series+1+3of6+Arthur+of+Brittany+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66582540d9e6f01ef84e295d9bb24684954709f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,88,37,64,217,230,240,30,248,78,41,93,155,178,70,132,149,71,9,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
