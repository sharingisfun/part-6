It is a combination of live and studio recordings which date from October 1976 to September 1977.\n\nIt's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of &quot;Industrial&quot; subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for Wolf Eyes, Brainbombs, Prurient, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, Second Annual Report counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film &quot;After Cease to Exist&quot;. \n\nWhich is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age, a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22cb59b78274ffcc77f843b80a789e4fd447024","amp;dn":"The+Second+Annual+Report+Of+THROBBING+GRISTLE+%2F+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22cb59b78274ffcc77f843b80a789e4fd447024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,44,181,155,120,39,79,252,199,127,132,59,128,167,137,228,253,68,112,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
