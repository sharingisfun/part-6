Yet this ancient sacrament has also been a source of controversy and oppression, culminating, as prize-winning historian John Cornwell reveals in The Dark Box, with the scandal of clerical child abuse. Drawing on extensive historical sources, contemporary reports, and first-hand accounts, Cornwell takes a hard look at the long evolution of confession.\nThe papacy made annual, one-on-one confession obligatory for the first time in the 13th century. In the era that followed, confession was a source of spiritual consolation as well as sexual and mercenary scandal. During the 16th century, the Church introduced the confession box to prevent sexual solicitation of women, but this private space gave rise to new forms of temptation, both for penitents and confessors. Yet no phase in the story of the sacrament has had such drastic consequences as a historic decree by Pope Pius X in 1910. In reaction to the spiritual perils of the new century, Pius sought to safeguard the Catholic faithful by lowering the age at which children made their first confession from their early teens to seven, while exhorting all Catholics to confess frequently instead of annually. This sweeping, inappropriately early imposition of the sacrament gave priests an unprecedented and privileged role in the lives of young boys and girlsÃ¢â‚¬â€a role that a significant number would exploit in the decades that followed.\nA much-needed account of confessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fraught history, The Dark Box explores the sources of the sacramentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harm and shame, while recognizing its continuing power to offer consolation and reconciliation.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\nCornwell was raised Catholic and began studying for the priesthood at an early age. While in seminary, a priest attempted to seduce him during confession. Although Cornwell subsequently left the church, he occasionally wonders whether his journey masks a search for the lost abusers of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood. Read as a personal odyssey, his book is quite interesting. Cornwell is less successful proving in any rigorous historical or social-scientific manner his provocative claim that the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1910 decision to lower the age for confession from 14 to 7, and increase its frequency, eventually resulted in the sex-abuse scandal that plagues the church today. That said, he asks important questions about confessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential to inflict lasting psychological damage on children with the concept of sin and evil, especially as they concern oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s physical body and natural urges, and the requirement to confess transgressions are introduced at too early an age. CornwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book also underscores the sad fact that some priests used the cover of the confessional for their evil purposes. --Christopher McConnell\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nFinancial Times\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A meticulously researched, carefully wrought and quietly furious anathema upon the Catholic Church.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGuardian, UK\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] powerful, persuasive, and disturbing book....The Dark Box is a major contribution to the Catholic churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s examination of conscience about the roots and circumstances of sexual abuse.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSunday Times, UK\n&quot;[An] absorbing history of the confessional...forceful.&quot;\n\nObserver, UK\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Dark Box is a powerful, impassioned treatise about the dangers of confession.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTimes Literary Supplement\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A short but explosive book which is part religious history, part autobiography, part journalistic expose, and part manifesto for change...The Dark Box is a book that anyone concerned with the future of the Catholic Church should take seriously.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIrish Independent\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A powerful and disturbing addition to the literature on the subject, and lays bare the dysfunctional nature of a church which has still come nowhere near to facing its own self-inflicted demons.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBuffalo News\n&quot;This book, perhaps threatening to some, performs a signal service. It is an examination of conscience for the Catholic Church about what it has done and what it has failed to do in the matter of helping Catholics come to terms with forgiveness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Spectator, UK\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have a confession to make. I really enjoyed this book...smartly, smoothly written.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCommercial Dispatch, Ohio\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There may have been those who benefited from confession, and even more who found it a mechanical process, compared to those who found themselves thrown into sexual guilt and confusion because of it. Critics will say this book depicts only the darker side of the dark box, but Cornwell's church would be better off understanding the issues expressed in this thoughtful and heartfelt book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKirkus\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A haunting study, both scholarly and personal, that situates the practice of confession as the source of the Catholic ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clerical abuse.... Enlisting a legion of voices attesting to their Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsoul murderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by confessional priests, Cornwell offers another strong indictment of the church.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJohn Heilpern, contributing editor, Vanity Fair\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With his brilliant The Dark Box, John Cornwell, a most fair-minded hammer and conscience of the Catholic Church, has gone to the terrifying roots of clerical sexual abuse throughout Catholicism's history. He has made the nightmare link between sacramental confession and the abuse of children, while anticipating the future of a church pre-occupied with sex, sin and damnation. I cannot imagine a more timely book than The Dark Box in Pope Francis' brave new inclusive age of love, reconciliation and social conscience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGarry Wills, author of Why I Am a Catholic\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A maxim often cited from the fifth-century theologian Prosper of Aquitaine is Lex orandi lex credendi -- the way we pray is the way we believe. In accord with this norm, the fact that Catholics have by and large given up going to confession means that they have stopped believing in it. Cornwell tells us why we should.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGary Kearns, Maynooth University College, Ireland\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An elegant and profound reflection upon what turned out to be a tragic experiment in church discipline.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDavid Lodge\n&quot;A brilliant book, and an important one. Confession turns out to be the key that explains so much that is discreditable in the history of the Catholic Church, especially over the last 100 years. You show that &quot;Saint&quot; Pius X created a kind of spiritual totalitarian state similar to the secular dictatorships of the same period, complete with a loyalty oath to the leader. The practice of frequent confession and communion which he initiated, instilled in Catholics from an impressionable early age, combined with the moral theology of mortal sin, ensured a cowed obedience, or encouraged an Orwellian double-speak, until, with John XXIII and Vatican II, Catholics suddenly started thinking for themselves and deserted confession in droves. Interesting that it was a sexual issue, contraception, not a doctrinal one, that caused the old\nconsensus to collapse.&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJohn Cornwell is a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge.
