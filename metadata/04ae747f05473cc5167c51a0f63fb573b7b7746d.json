Eric Drexler is the founding father of nanotechnology - the science of engineering on a molecular level. In Radical Abundance, he shows how rapid scientific progress is about to change our world. Thanks to atomically precise manufacturing, we will soon have the power to produce radically more of what people want, and at a lower cost. The result will shake the very foundations of our economy and environment.\n\nAlready, scientists have constructed prototypes for circuit boards built of millions of precisely arranged atoms. The advent of this kind of atomic precision promises to change the way we make things - cleanly, inexpensively, and on a global scale. It allows us to imagine a world where solar arrays cost no more than cardboard and aluminum foil, and laptops cost about the same.\n\nA provocative tour of cutting edge science and its implications by the field's founder and master, Radical Abundance offers a mind-expanding vision of a world hurtling toward an unexpected future.\n\nContents:\n\nPART 1 AN UNEXPECTED WORLD\n\nCHAPTER 1 Atoms, Bits, and Radical Abundance\nCHAPTER 2 An Early Journey of Ideas\nCHAPTER 3 From Molecules to Nanosystems\n\nPART 2 THE REVOLUTION IN CONTEXT\n\nCHAPTER 4 Three Revolutions, and a Fourth\nCHAPTER 5 The Look and Feel of the Nanoscale World\nCHAPTER 6 The Ways We Make Things\n\nPART 3 EXPLORING DEEP TECHNOLOGY\n\nCHAPTER 7 Science and the Timeless Landscape of Technology\nCHAPTER 8 The Clashing Concerns of Engineering and Science\nCHAPTER 9 Exploring the Potential of Technology\n\nPART 4 THE TECHNOLOGY OF RADICAL ABUNDANCE\n\nCHAPTER 10 The Machinery of Radical Abundance\nCHAPTER 11 The Products of Radical Abundance\n\nPART 5 THE TRAJECTORY OF TECHNOLOGY\n\nCHAPTER 12 Today's Technologies of Atomic Precision\nCHAPTER 13 A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future...\nCHAPTER 14 How to Accelerate Progress\n\nPART 6 BENDING THE ARC OF THE FUTURE\n\nCHAPTER 15 Transforming the Material Basis of Civilization\nCHAPTER 16 Managing a Catastrophic Success\nCHAPTER 17 Security for an Unconventional Future\nCHAPTER 18 Changing Our Conversation About the Future\n\nAuthor:\n\nK.
