But Kieslowski spent roughly half his career making documentaries that have been rarely seen outside Poland; fortunately, a recent traveling retrospective and a newly released 2-disc Polish DVD offer opportunities to catch up.\n\nContent:\nDVD 1:\n1. Z miasta Lodzi (From the city of Lodz), 1969\n2. Bylem zolnierzem, (When I was a soldier ) 1970\n3. Refren (Chorus), 1972\n4. Murarz (Bricklayer), 1973\n5. Przeswietlenie (Overexposure), 1974\n6. Zyciorys (Biography ), 1975\n7. Klaps (Cut), 1976\n\nDVD 2:\n1. Pierwsza milosc (First love), 1974\n2. Szpital (Hospital), 1976\n3. Z punktu widzenia nocnego portiera (From the night porter's point of view), 1977\n4. Siedem kobiet w rÃƒÂ³znym wieku (Seven women of all ages), 1978\n5. Gadajace glowy (Talking heads), 1980\n\nBrowsing the North American Kieslowski DVDs, it appears that the only documentary unique to them is The Office (1966), a short film Kieslowski made in school; the Polish DVD repeats From a Night PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Point of View (1978) and Talking Heads (1980), but offers 10 more films.\n\nThe films are largely cinema verite in styleÃ¢â‚¬â€œstrictly observational, without overt commentary or contextualizationÃ¢â‚¬â€œand range anywhere from ten minutes to just short of an hour in length. And unlike the documentary work of, say, the Dardenne brothers, which is stylistically (though not thematically) different from their fictional work, KieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s documentary style shows a fondness for the handheld camera and facial close-ups that would dominate his features. In the documentary IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m So-So (1995), he emphasized his approach:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Perhaps we were the first postwar film generationÃ¢â‚¬â€œand I say Ã¢â‚¬ËœweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because there were so many of usÃ¢â‚¬â€œwho tried to describe the world as it was. We showed only micro-worlds. The titles suggest this: The School, The Factory, The Hospital, or The Office. If these mini-observations were pieced together, they would describe life in Poland.... Living in an undescribed world is hard. You have to try it to know what it feels like. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like having no identity. Your problems and suffering disappear; they disintegrate. To put it more radically: you feel completely cut off from other people.... We lived according to ideals: Fraternity, equality, and justice. But none of these things existed, least of all justice.... Documentaries deal with people who live real lives.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s documentaries tend to construct this implicit critique of official reality in cumulative fashion within each film as well. As film scholar Paul Coates puts it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“KieslowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most frequent solution was the serial alignment of voices expressing the same, or cognate, feelings, individual instances massing into the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢statistically significant proportionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that validates generalization.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Many of the films are highly-edited montages collating people and ideas in provocative ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56aa13c7026776098106a617185d6e53d512332a","amp;dn":"Kieslowski+-+Polish+School+of+Documentary+%28Art+1969-1980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56aa13c7026776098106a617185d6e53d512332a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,170,19,199,2,103,118,9,129,6,166,23,24,93,110,83,213,18,51,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
