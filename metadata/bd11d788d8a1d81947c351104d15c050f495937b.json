Their search takes them to the part of Central Florida known as Bone Valley, famous primarily for two things: a ruthless subculture of black-marketers who trade in illegal artifacts and fossils, and a multibillion-dollar phosphate industry whose strip mines compromise the very ground they walk on.\r\n\r\nNeither enterprise tolerates nosy outsiders. For each, public exposure equals big financial lossesâ€”and in a region built on a million-year accumulation of bones, there is no shortage of spots in which to hide a corpse.
