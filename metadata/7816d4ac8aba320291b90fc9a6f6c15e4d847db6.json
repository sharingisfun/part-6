The ambling shakiness of the first set puts this into the category of simply average-caliber fare from Garcia and friends. Die-hard completist Deadheads and those who prefer the bluesier side of GarciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multifaceted playing might take interest, but the casual listener might find this set falling short of inspired, even for the fun-loving vibe that develops as it goes on.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7816d4ac8aba320291b90fc9a6f6c15e4d847db6","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+Garcia+Live+Vol+5+Keystone+Berkeley+%282014%29+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7816d4ac8aba320291b90fc9a6f6c15e4d847db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,22,212,172,138,186,50,2,145,185,15,201,166,246,193,94,77,132,125,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
