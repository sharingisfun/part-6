Strong, contemporary colors create a stimulating environment for young eyes and a modern, uplifting living space for the entire family. Knitted Nursery combines strong primaries, fuchsia pinks, outspoken oranges, and plenty of vibrant hues in a variety of adorable easy-to-follow patterns, including a snuggle blanket, ABC blocks, cot bunting, beach hut bookends, and a washing line wall hanger. All projects use cotton DK yarn which is easy to wash, durable, and child-friendly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c552c966262f87aa2ae317ee3798b720be3f5acc","amp;dn":"Knitted+Nursery%3A+Toys+Clothing+and+Furnishings+for+a+Beautiful+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c552c966262f87aa2ae317ee3798b720be3f5acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,82,201,102,38,47,135,170,42,227,23,238,55,152,183,32,190,63,90,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
