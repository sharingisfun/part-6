Mount ISO (Via PowerISO or any other software that handles ISO's)\n2. Launch\n3. Install\n4. That's it, there is no CD key, yes, it's THAT old.\n\n~~~~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd83d9692e7c01924484e5adb3e85b481ebadb6","amp;dn":"Deer+Avenger+4%3A+The+Rednecks+Strike+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd83d9692e7c01924484e5adb3e85b481ebadb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,216,61,150,146,231,192,25,36,72,78,90,219,62,133,180,129,235,173,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
