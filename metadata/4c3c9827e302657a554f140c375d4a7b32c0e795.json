Flay&quot;\nAlbum: &quot;Suburban Rap Queen&quot;\nDate: &quot;2004&quot;\nGenre: &quot;Alternative Hip-Hop&quot;\n\nK. Flay, Suburban Rap Queen\n4.2 stars out of 5\n\nThis is a very solid album; for a dorm-room-recorded debut from a 'green' MC, it's amazing. That's how I am with DIY and indie stuff: it still has to bring it.\nTh beats are apparently self-produced, but they don't quite have the obnoxious feel that often plagues such things.\n\nTrack 1 is an intro I don't have\n\nTrack 2 - Suburban Rap Queen\n* Great title track, and great title for this non-male non-urban rapper\n\nTrack 3 - Not Gonna Happen\n* A crisp 'I've had enough' statement apparently aimed at a manipulative friend.\n\nTrack 4 - The Whoosie Song\n* Maybe a few messages, but mainly works as a fast upbeat track. (Track 7, How I'm Rockin', is also a party.) &quot;Damn...&quot; backing vocal repeated a bit.\n\nTrack 5 - Hey Ladies\n* Understandably has had enough of sexism, particularly in the rap industry. Track 11 (Frat Party) takes similar aim at the louts at certain parties. &quot;I will stimulate your brain, not your dick, you idiot.&quot;\n\nTrack 6 - Red Meat\n* Ironically not ranting against female objectification, but rather a really funny track ranting in favor of literal red meat. The omnivore in me is quite amused by this non-vegetarian anthem. :)\n\nTrack 8 - Bang Bang\n* Straightforward anti-imperialism cut\n\nTrack 9 - Saved and Track 10 - Drama\n* These couple of serious slow tracks admittedly feel amongst the album's low points.\n\nTrack 12 - I See The World\n* A fairly haunting and powerful track about her world compares to the harsh environment that was rap's original incubator.\n\nTrack 13 - Time Stops\n&quot;Time Stops for no one, and you're one of millions&quot;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c3c9827e302657a554f140c375d4a7b32c0e795","amp;dn":"K.Flay+-+Suburban+Rap+Queen+%5B2004%5D+%5B160kbps+MP3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c3c9827e302657a554f140c375d4a7b32c0e795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,60,152,39,227,2,101,122,85,79,20,12,55,93,74,123,50,192,231,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
