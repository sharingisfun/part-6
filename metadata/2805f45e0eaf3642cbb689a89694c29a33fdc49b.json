As a fan, it is impossible to hear the classic orchestrations of Sam Spence without being transplanted onto the gridiron. \n\nWhile there was a release of five vinyl albums in the ?70s to fan club members, there has never been true commercial availability of this music to the enormous general NFL fan constituency. Of course the music didn?t stop with Sam Spence. \n\nAutumn Thunder provides fans with four decades worth of pure adrenaline in a ten CD box set. Featuring the compositions of NFL Films staff composers Tom Hedden and Dave Robidoux,-- the four-time Emmy-award winning composers who give wings to every Films production?Autumn Thunder is the essence of the game and the very heart of NFL Films.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2805f45e0eaf3642cbb689a89694c29a33fdc49b","amp;dn":"Autumn+Thunder+40+years+of+NFL+Films+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2805f45e0eaf3642cbb689a89694c29a33fdc49b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,5,244,94,14,175,54,66,203,182,137,168,150,148,194,154,51,253,196,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
