And for good reason: it violated one of the sacred tenets of the swamp boy genre: do not cast the annoying little kid who played Zindy as your swamp boy.\n\nUnfortunately, Zindy was cast in the movie because the director is his father, Rene Cardona Jr, who also made the previously RiffTrax-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢d The Bermuda Triangle and Treasure of The Amazon. Unlike those movies, Zindy does not have a killer doll or a nazi hunting Donald Pleasance. It does however have a chimp that does the dishes, gator wrestling, and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most deadly two square feet of quicksand.\n\nWhen ZindyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandfather discovers his son and daughter-in-law have been hospitalized, he does what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d all do: flee the premises leaving them to die and guns down the man he believes is responsible. Then he gathers up their infant grandson and moves in with a chimp named Toribio. They move into the swamp, right? WRONG. Turns out Zindy the Swamp Boy is actually forbidden from entering the swamp, or more specifically the swamp zone. Yep, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that kind of movie. Sadly, Zindy also plays the flute, so you quickly begin to root for a quick outbreak of malaria to sweep through the swamp and all attached zones.\n\nFortunately, the movie has an ending so wonderful that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to start the movie over as soon as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done, just to relive everything you just saw with the knowledge of where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading. To say any more would be a disservice to you. Please watch, and experience Zindy The Swamp Boy for the first time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329140668b9684b44e84eccefc0c06971a5ff2af","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Zindy+The+Swamp+Boy.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329140668b9684b44e84eccefc0c06971a5ff2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,145,64,102,139,150,132,180,78,132,236,206,252,12,6,151,26,95,242,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
