It was first aired on July 11, 2010, currently the longest-running program for being successful for five years on Good Sunday surpassing X-Man.\n\nRunning Man is classified as an &quot;urban action variety&quot;; a genre of variety shows in an urban environment.[1] The MCs and guests complete missions in a landmark to win the race.[2] The show has since shifted to a more familiar reality-variety show concept focused on games. It has garnered attention as being the come-back program for Yoo Jae-suk, the main MC of the program, after leaving Good Sunday's Family Outing in February 2010.[3]\n\nAiring at the 5 pm KST time slot for most of its run, Running Man switched to the second part of Good Sunday (which happened on May 22 and May 29, 2011 with Kim Yu-na's Kiss and Cry but was quickly switched back due to low ratings) beginning May 6, 2012, airing after Kim Byung-man's Law of the Jungle 2 at 6:10 pm and airing against KBS2 Happy Sunday's 1 Night 2 Days Season 2 and MBC Sunday Night's I Am a Singer 2.[4]\n\nThe show has been popular in other parts of Asia as well, and gained online popularity among Hallyu fans, having been subtitled to a number of languages by volunteers, such as English, Spanish, French, Thai, Malay, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nOn November 19, 2014, the show's head director, Cho Hyo-jin, announced his departure from the show after working with the members for four years.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9475bbf71845799594dd46bd49eb6f8ad2983726","amp;dn":"Running+Man+EP+246+720p+SUBBED+-+%5BKSN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9475bbf71845799594dd46bd49eb6f8ad2983726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,117,187,247,24,69,121,149,148,221,70,189,73,235,111,138,210,152,55,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
