We dig deeper and we blow you higher. We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour and treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and WrongÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œfrom The Man Who Was Thursday\n\nIn the nightmarish and paradoxical world we live in, with ubiquitous secret services and terrorist plots galore, it is time to reread the surreal tale of espionage written a century ago by G. K. Chesterton. A book, in ChestertonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words, that Ã¢â‚¬Å“was intended to describe the world of wild doubt and despair which the pessimist were generally describing at that dateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nKingsley Amis wrote about it:\n\nI have read it so many times since that, if a sentence anywhere in it were put in front of me, I bet I could be pretty accurate about what was in the next one. And yet it remains the most thrilling book I have ever read. (...) The Man Who Was Thursday is not quite a political bad dream, nor a metaphysical thriller, nor a cosmic joke in the form of a spy novel, but it has something of all three.
