The new audio release offers listeners an excellent opportunity to connectâ€”or reconnectâ€”with a classic text whose thematic elementsâ€”nuclear terror, the complications of science, American imperialism, global capitalism and the role of religion in public lifeâ€”are remarkably relevant to our 21st-century landscape. The story line centers on a young writer's quest to research the history of the atomic bomb, which leads to a bizarre political soap opera and apocalyptic showdown on the shores of a seedy banana republic in the Caribbean. Tony Roberts brings tremendous energy to his reading, projecting a sardonic tone perfectly suited to Vonnegut. His portrayals of the principal male figures sometimes take the form of interchangeable over-the-top carnival barkers, but given the essence of the material, such a unnuanced approach can be understood and appreciated. The audiobook includes a 2005 interview in which Vonnegutâ€”who died April 11, 2007â€”discusses how his life shaped his literary craft","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed4f77adf1f1515386bfcea7f59a1d63850d4a1","amp;dn":"Cat%27s+Cradle+-+Kurt+Vonnegut+-+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed4f77adf1f1515386bfcea7f59a1d63850d4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,212,247,122,223,31,21,21,56,107,252,234,127,89,161,214,56,80,212,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
