The Goodies are a three man agency whose brief is to do \\'anything, anytime\\'. This gave the series carte blanche to do whatsoever it pleased, with a cartoon-like surrealism and a heavy reliance on slapstick. Ran for ten years on BBC TV before removing for one final series to the commercial channel London Weekend Television.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23dd7a545156da383b0493dc9c0dc425eae93db4","amp;dn":"The+Goodies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23dd7a545156da383b0493dc9c0dc425eae93db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,221,122,84,81,86,218,56,59,4,147,220,156,13,196,37,234,233,61,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
