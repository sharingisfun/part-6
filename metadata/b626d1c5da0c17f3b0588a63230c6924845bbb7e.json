It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane's almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Blue Train\n02.Moment's Notice\n03.Locomotion\n04.I'm Old Fashioned\n05.Lazy Bird\n06.Blue Train (Alternate Take)\n07.Lazy Bird (Alternate Take)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b626d1c5da0c17f3b0588a63230c6924845bbb7e","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Blue+Train+%5BExtra+Tracks%5D+%282003%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b626d1c5da0c17f3b0588a63230c6924845bbb7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,38,209,197,218,12,23,243,176,88,138,99,35,12,105,36,132,91,187,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
