But Lilly and company refuse to succumb, and in a stunning counteroffensive, the beleaguered townspeople save themselves by joining forces with a mysterious religious sect fresh from the wilderness.\n\nLed by an enigmatic preacher named Jeremiah, this rogue church group seems tailor made for Woodbury and LillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of a democratic, family-friendly future. The two factions meld into one, the town prospers, and everything seems hopeful for the first time since the plague broke out.\n \nBut things Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially in the world of the walking dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are often not what they seem. Jeremiah and his followers harbor a dark secret, the evidence of which very gradually begins to unravel.\n\nAlong with a popular TV show also based on KirkmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AMC comic books, The Walking Dead franchise is just getting better and better with BonansingaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest novel. In a stunning and horrifying finale, the world for Lilly and her close friends is turned upside down, and it is solely up to Lilly Caul to cleanse the town once and for all of its poisonous fate.\n\nThese novels continue to be a great companion for fans of the television series and graphic novels!\n\nContains\n\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Descent - Jay Bonansinga.azw3\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Descent - Jay Bonansinga.epub\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Descent - Jay Bonansinga.lrf\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Descent - Jay Bonansinga.mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf055d520ec796d95e84291ed5e6a712f8fbec01","amp;dn":"Robert+Kirkman%27s+The+Walking+Dead+Descent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf055d520ec796d95e84291ed5e6a712f8fbec01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,5,93,82,14,199,150,217,94,132,41,30,213,230,167,18,248,251,236,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
