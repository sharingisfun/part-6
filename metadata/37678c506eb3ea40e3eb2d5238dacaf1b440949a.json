No longer is the choice simply red or white, or wines from California, France, or Italy. The typical shopper today has access to wines from those regions plus South Africa, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia. If that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t confusing enough, Asian, Latin American, and Creole dishes might find their way onto the same table. Perfect Pairings, by well-known Master Sommelier and respected restaurant industry veteran Evan Goldstein, provides straightforward, practical advice for choosing the right bottle for each meal. The quintessential resource for matching wine and food, this book includes 58 companion recipes developed by celebrated chef Joyce Goldstein that showcase each type of wine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37678c506eb3ea40e3eb2d5238dacaf1b440949a","amp;dn":"Perfect+Pairings%3A+A+Master+Sommelier%27s+Practical+Advice+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37678c506eb3ea40e3eb2d5238dacaf1b440949a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,103,140,80,110,179,234,64,227,235,45,82,56,218,202,241,180,64,148,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
