Wollie is meeting plenty of eligible bachelors but not falling in love, not until she stumbles over a dead body en route to Rio Pescado--a state-run mental hospital--and is momentarily taken hostage by a charismatic &quot;doctor&quot; who is on the run from the Mob. Wollie fears that her beloved brother, a paranoid schizophrenic living at Rio Pescado, is involved in the murder, so rather than go to the authorities, she decides to solve the crime on her own. As she meets up with an array of small-time crooks and swaggering mobsters only slightly more sinister than the men she's been dating, Wollie realizes that &quot;getting dumped&quot; is the least of her problems. Finding true love, she discovers, sometimes means learning how to avoid getting killed . . .\r\n\r\nDating Dead Men will keep readers guessing until the final bullet is shot--and cheering for the irresistible Wollie as she makes her way out of confusion and into the welcoming embrace of Mr. Right","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2e3ca6a8c49cdfd532cb5be9050d762d17655c","amp;dn":"Harley+Jane+Kozak-Dating+Dead+Men++%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2e3ca6a8c49cdfd532cb5be9050d762d17655c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,46,60,166,168,196,156,223,213,50,203,91,233,5,13,118,45,23,101,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
