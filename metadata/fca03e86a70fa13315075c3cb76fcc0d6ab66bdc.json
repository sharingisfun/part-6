John McMurry's ORGANIC CHEMISTRY is consistently praised as the most clearly written book available for the course. In John McMurry's words: &quot;I wrote this book because I love writing. I get great pleasure and satisfaction from taking a complicated subject, turning it around until I see it clearly from a new angle, and then explaining it in simple words.&quot; Through his lucid writing and ability to show the beauty and logic of organic chemistry, McMurry makes learning enjoyable. The highest compliment that can be given to a chemistry book applies to McMurry: It works!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca03e86a70fa13315075c3cb76fcc0d6ab66bdc","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+%2F+8th+Edition+%28John+E.+McMurry%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca03e86a70fa13315075c3cb76fcc0d6ab66bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,160,62,134,167,15,161,51,21,7,92,60,183,111,204,13,106,182,107,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
