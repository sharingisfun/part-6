It was released on 1 November 2010 by Peaceville Records and is a concept album centered on the demon Lilith. Earlier the album was erroneously referred to as All Hallows Eve, probably because the announced release date was close to Hallowe'en.\n\nIt is Cradle of Filth's's only album to feature keyboardist Ashley Ellyllon, and is also the band's final album with Dave Pybus as their bass player.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Concept and musical style\n    2 Release\n    3 Reception\n    4 Track listing\n        4.1 Limited Fan Edition\n    5 Personnel\n        5.1 Cradle of Filth\n        5.2 Additional Personnel\n        5.3 Production\n    6 Charts\n    7 References\n\nConcept and musical style\n\nDarkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa is a concept album in the same vein as its predecessor Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder, this time centering on the demon Lilith, the first wife of the biblical Adam. Dani Filth revealed to Metal Hammer in September 2010 that it would be a &quot;feminine&quot; companion piece to Godspeed, &quot;which was a very masculine album, obviously due to its protagonist, Gilles De Rais.&quot; Unlike previous historically-based concept albums Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder and Cruelty and the Beast, Darkly, Darkly tells an original story. &quot;It's about the resurgence of Lilith into modern society as a deity,&quot; Filth said. &quot;There's a bit of Victoriana in there. Essentially, at heart, it's a nice gothic horror story.&quot; Reference to Greek mythology and the Knights Templar is also made, in what was referred to by the label as &quot;a dark tapestry of horror, madness and twisted sex&quot;. At an early stage of the album's development in August 2009, Filth hinted that the album's sound was &quot;creepily melodic, like Mercyful Fate or a dark Iron Maiden&quot;. The Metal Hammer interview also likened it to King Diamond.\n\nThe core album is the band's first to not feature any instrumental tracks. The special edition bonus track &quot;Adest Rosa Secreta Eros&quot; is arguably an instrumental, but features extensive narrative excerpts taken from Aleister Crowley's The Book of the Law.\nRelease\n\nOn 20 August 2010, a free mp3 of the track &quot;Lilith Immaculate&quot; was released by the band as reward for signing up for a mailing list following the album's development. On 29 September 2010 Cradle of Filth released the first official video of the album for the track &quot;Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)&quot;.\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t3/5 stars\nMetal Hammer (GER) \t5/7 stars\nRock Sound \t9/10 stars\nPopMatters \t8/10 stars\nSonic Seducer \t(favourable)\nMetal Storm \t(7.3/10)[14]\nRecord Collector \t3/5 stars\nLoud Online \t9/10 stars \nThrash Hits \t4/6 stars \n\nThe album received mainly good reviews. Thom Jurek at Allmusic said that it &quot;is tightly focused, employing COF's trademark orchestral and keyboard elements to fine effect, with wildly intense... blastbeats from Marthus Skaroupka, and screaming guitars... courtesy of Paul Allender and James McEllroy. The concentration on writing and arrangement is disciplined, with a strong set of dynamics, a terrific mix, and great production&quot;. Pete Withers at Rock Sound rated it 9 out of 10 and said &quot;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa displays a masterful control over the multi-faceted Cradle of Filth sound; brutal vocal gymnastics, skull-rattling double-kicks, symphonic flourishes, dramatic narrative and balls-out axe-slinging all make their presence known, but in a manner which routinely serves to bolster the coherency of the greater whole&quot;. Joel McIver of the British music magazine Record Collector in his positive review finds that the atmosphere of the album &quot;is one of refined sophistication rather than confrontation&quot;, showing the band not &quot;resting on their laurels&quot;, but &quot;taking some unexpected musical diversions&quot;.\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Dani Filth, all music composed by Cradle of Filth and Mark Newby-Robson.\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Dani Filth, all music composed by Cradle of Filth and Mark Newby-Robson.\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;The Cult of Venus Aversa&quot;   \t7:07\n2. \t&quot;One Foul Step from the Abyss&quot;   \t4:53\n3. \t&quot;The Nun with the Astral Habit&quot;   \t4:55\n4. \t&quot;Retreat of the Sacred Heart&quot;   \t3:56\n5. \t&quot;The Persecution Song&quot;   \t5:34\n6. \t&quot;Deceiving Eyes&quot;   \t6:43\n7. \t&quot;Lilith Immaculate&quot;   \t6:12\n8. \t&quot;The Spawn of Love and War&quot;   \t6:19\n9. \t&quot;Harlot on a Pedestal&quot;   \t5:09\n10. \t&quot;Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)&quot;   \t4:33\n11. \t&quot;Beyond Eleventh Hour&quot;   \t7:16\nTotal length:\n\t62:37 \t\nLimited Edition bonus disc \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Beast of Extermination&quot;   \t5:32\n2. \t&quot;Truth &amp; Agony&quot;   \t5:56\n3. \t&quot;Mistress from the Sucking Pit&quot;   \t7:00\n4. \t&quot;Behind the Jagged Mountains&quot;   \t5:44\n5.\n\nThis limited edition comes packaged in a deluxe hard box containing:\n\n    2CDs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the album plus a disc of bonus tracks and demos (including &quot;Adest Rosa Secreta Eros&quot;, an exclusive track not available on any other edition of the album)\n    DVD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the promo video for &quot;Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)&quot; plus a documentary on the making of the video\n    A 64 page hardback book containing band photos, musings and artwork\n    An exclusive t-shirt available only in this box\n    A limited edition lenticular 3D image of the album cover art\n    Five photographic prints\n    An official certificate of authenticity from the band\n\nLimited Fan Edition bonus disc \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Beast of Extermination&quot;   \t5:32\n2. \t&quot;Truth &amp; Agony&quot;   \t5:56\n3. \t&quot;Adest Rosa Secreta Eros&quot;   \t7:25\n4. \t&quot;Mistress from the Sucking Pit&quot;   \t7:00\n5. \t&quot;Behind the Jagged Mountains&quot;   \t5:44\n6. \t&quot;The Cult of Venus Aversa&quot; (demo version) \t6:48\n7. \t&quot;The Nun with the Astral Habit&quot; (demo version) \t4:58\n8. \t&quot;Deceiving Eyes&quot; (demo version) \t6:44\nPersonnel\nCradle of Filth\n\n    Dani Filth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, producer\n    Paul Allender Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars\n    James McIlroy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars\n    Dave Pybus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Ashley Ellyllon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Martin Marthus Ã…Â karoupka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\n    Mark Newby-Robson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ orchestration\n    Andy James Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional guitars\n    Lucy Atkins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Dora Kemp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals &amp; choir\n    Ralph Woodward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ choir conductor &amp; arranger\n    Ruth McCabe, Tim Cutts, Craig Miller, Philippa Mann, Anna Asbach-Cullen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ choir\nThis sounds good so will anyone seed or will it just show up for 5 min. then drop off, guess ill wait and see......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d3efb06c10e15012158e187a0d1729415964ef","amp;dn":"Cradle+Of+Filth+-+Darkly%2CDarkly%2CVenus+Aversa%28Limited+Edition%29+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d3efb06c10e15012158e187a0d1729415964ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,211,239,176,108,16,225,80,18,21,142,24,122,13,23,41,65,89,100,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
