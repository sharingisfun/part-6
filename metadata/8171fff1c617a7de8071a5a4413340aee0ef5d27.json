It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and one of the first African novels written in English to receive global critical acclaim. It is a staple book in schools throughout Africa and widely read and studied in English-speaking countries around the world. The title of the novel comes from William Butler Yeats' poem &quot;The Second Coming&quot;.[1]\nThe novel depicts the life of Okonkwo, a leader and local wrestling champion in UmuofiaÃ¢â‚¬â€one of a fictional group of nine villages in Nigeria, inhabited by the Igbo people (in the novel, &quot;Ibo&quot;). It describes his family and personal history, the customs and society of the Igbo, and the influence of British colonialism and Christian missionaries on the Igbo community during the late nineteenth century.\nThings Fall Apart was followed by a sequel, No Longer at Ease (1960), originally written as the second part of a larger work together with Things Fall Apart, and Arrow of God (1964), on a similar subject. Achebe states that his two later novels, A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987), while not featuring Okonkwo's descendants, are spiritual successors to the previous novels in chronicling African history.\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;365b435e575b5b5752184157475744185754545745765a5f40531855595b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8171fff1c617a7de8071a5a4413340aee0ef5d27","amp;dn":"Achebe%2C+Chinua+-+Things+Fall+Apart%5Bvickey1214%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8171fff1c617a7de8071a5a4413340aee0ef5d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,113,255,241,198,23,167,222,128,113,165,164,65,51,64,174,224,239,93,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
