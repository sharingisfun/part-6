I hope that's kosher.\r\n\r\nOne other thing, is doing it this way and thus exposing the existing torrent a useful service?\r\nI could use some feedback on this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af3a3c060d9be4c01672e1b3b258e6fd3b3f9ed","amp;dn":"Once.Upon.a.Time.S05E21.720p.HDTV.x264-AVS%5Brarbg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af3a3c060d9be4c01672e1b3b258e6fd3b3f9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,243,163,192,96,217,190,76,1,103,46,27,59,37,142,111,211,179,249,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
