Not only does Grant have a talent for catchy tunes, but his lyrics are very intelligent, often having a message of some sort as in the song about democracy in South Africa called Gimme Hope Joanna. The first disc contains the original versions of his massive chartbusters like I Don't Wanna Dance, Electric Avenue, Living On The Frontline and Do You Feel My Love, and goes even further back to his very first hits like Baby Come Back. They are all superb reggae tracks with a fine pop sensibility and propulsive beats. Disc Two contains breathtaking club mixes of songs like Frontline, Hello Africa, Walking On Sunshine and Do You Feel My Love, making this album absolutely essential for the Eddy Grant fan. The rhythmic textures here are very impressive and lend a fresh new perspective to the original songs. Grant was a unique talent in the reggae world, rootsy enough for the reggae enthusiast but accessible enough for the lover of mainstream music - that's why he had such a good chart run in the seventies and eighties. He was also a brilliant composer, lyricist and singer. I highly recommend this album to all reggae fans.\nAmazon Review By Pieter Uys\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Gimme Hope Jo'anna\n[02] I Don't Wanna Dance\n[03] Electric Avenue\n[04] Can't Get Enough Of You\n[05] Do You Feel My Love\n[06] Till I Can't Take Love No More\n[07] Killer On The Rampage\n[08] Baby Come Back\n[09] Walking On Sunshine\n[10] Living On The Frontline\n[11] Boys In The Street\n[12] Romancing The Stone\n[13] War Party\n[14] Hello Africa\n[15] Put A Hold On It\n[16] Welcome To La Tigre\n[17] Don't Back Down\n\nPlay Time - 01h:11m:51s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Living On The Front Line\n[02] Hello Africa\n[03] Preachin' Genocide\n[04] Exiled (From The Love I Know)\n[05] Nobody's Got Time\n[06] Walking On Sunshine\n[07] Do You Feel My Love\n[08] The Youth Tom Tom\n[09] African Kings\n\nPlay Time - 01h:08m:04s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:19m:55s\nTotal File Size....................... 335mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
