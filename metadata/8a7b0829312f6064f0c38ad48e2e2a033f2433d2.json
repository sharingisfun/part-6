Vassily Kalinnikovâ€™s symphonies hover on the edge of the repertoire, but they are very beautiful worksâ€“a touch stiff formally, perhaps, but melodically extremely attractive, and very, very Russian. They actually sound a bit similar, but all that means is that if you like one, youâ€™ll like the other just as much. Neither outstays its welcome; both fit on a single CD lasting a touch over 77 minutes.\r\nKees Bakels and the orchestra, as with the Rimsky-Korsakov recordings from these forces, make a wholly positive impression. The strings sing richly in the soaring melodies in the allegros and slow movements; rhythms snap with the requisite tang in the two scherzos. Bakels pays special attention to details of color and balance: listen to how sensitively the ticking harp in the First symphonyâ€™s slow movement underpins the musical discourse. Itâ€™s truly poetic. If you want these works in modern sound, this is the disc to get.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\nSymphony No.1 in G minor (1894-95)\r\n1. I. Allegro moderato [13'39]\r\n2. II.
