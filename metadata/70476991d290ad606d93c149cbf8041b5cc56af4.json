Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which at 13 was compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, and for his guitar solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted for his frequent use of wide vibratos.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWander This World is the third studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released in 1998, when he was 17. The album was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios and Oarfin Studios in Minneapolis and the Sound Kitchen in Nashville. This album produced Lang's first Grammy nomination.\n\nThe album contains a mix of genres; some tracks are blues, while others are Southern-style soul, funk, or rock with blues feeling. &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; and Luther Allison's &quot;Cherry Red Wine&quot; are twelve-bar blues, &quot;Walking Away&quot; and &quot;Second Guessing&quot; are similar to 1960s Memphis soul, and &quot;The Levee&quot; and &quot;Still Rainin'&quot; are more rock orientated.\n\nReviewer Alex Henderson commented on how mature the 17-year-old Lang sounded, saying the album often sounded like it could be the work of a 30 year old.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJonny Lang - vocals, lead guitar\nRichie Hayward - drums\nDavid Smith - bass\nJack Holder - rhythm guitars, keyboards\nSteve Cropper - guitars\nPaul Diethelm - dobro on &quot;Wander This World&quot;\nKevin Bowe - rhythm guitar on &quot;The Levee&quot;\nTommy Burroughs - acoustic guitar on &quot;Walking Away&quot;, background vocals on &quot;Right Back&quot;\nBruce McCabe - keyboards\nRicky Peterson - keyboards\nJimmy Davis - background vocals on &quot;Right Back&quot;\nEric Leeds - saxophone on &quot;I Am&quot;\nTom Tucker - engineer\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70476991d290ad606d93c149cbf8041b5cc56af4","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Wander+This+World+%5B1998%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70476991d290ad606d93c149cbf8041b5cc56af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,71,105,145,210,144,173,96,109,147,193,73,203,248,4,27,92,197,106,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
