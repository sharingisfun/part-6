It emulates nearly all aspects of the real hardware correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is by far the only emulator that supports link cable emulation with decent speed.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Fastest emulation, therefore saves your battery to the MAX.\r\nâ€¢ Very high game compatibility. Run nearly all games without a problem.\r\nâ€¢ Link cable emulation either on the same device, or across devices over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\r\nâ€¢ Gyroscope/tilt/solar sensor and rumble emulation through your Android's hardware sensors and vibrator!\r\nâ€¢ Enter multilined GameShark/ActionReplay/CodeBreaker cheat codes and enable/disable them on the fly while the game is running.\r\nâ€¢ High-level BIOS emulation. No BIOS file needed.\r\nâ€¢ IPS/UPS ROM patching\r\nâ€¢ OpenGL rendering backend, as well as normal rendering on devices without a GPU.\r\nâ€¢ Cool video filters through the support of GLSL shaders.\r\nâ€¢ Fast-forward to skip long stories, as well as slow down games to get past a level you cannot in normal speed.\r\nâ€¢ Save games at any time with screenshot\r\nâ€¢ On-screen keypad (multi-touch requires Android 2.0 or later), as well as shortcut buttons such as load/save.\r\nâ€¢ A very powerful screen layout editor, with which you can define the position and size for each of the on-screen controls, as well as for the game video.\r\nâ€¢ External controllers support, such as the MOGA controllers.\r\nâ€¢ Clean &amp; simple yet well-designed user interface. Seamlessly integrated with the latest Android.\r\nâ€¢ Create and switch to different screen-layout and key-mapping profiles.\r\nâ€¢ Create shortcuts to easily launch your favorite games from your desktop.\r\n\r\nWhat's New:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ [core] New alternative interpreter CPU emulation core. Not as fast as the DynaRec core (the default), but still very fast. Improves speed for a few games that depend heavily on self-modifying code.\r\nâ€¢ Fixed crash on Marshmallow for certain devices with external SD card.\r\nâ€¢ Fixed layout editor on devices that cannot auto rotate.\r\nâ€¢ Always show menu button on default screen layout.\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gba","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4ad77b00331b871d509e96d56fd21a3bf02c48","amp;dn":"Android+Gameboy+Advance+Emulator+%2B+1666+ROMs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4ad77b00331b871d509e96d56fd21a3bf02c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,74,215,123,0,51,27,135,29,80,158,150,213,111,210,26,59,240,44,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
