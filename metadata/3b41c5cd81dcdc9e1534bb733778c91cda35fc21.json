Portable and with folding stocks, both were widely issued to airborne troops and became the hallmark of Germany's infantry section and platoon leaders. A million were produced during the conflict Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and many found their ways into the hands of paramilitary and irregular forces from Israel to Vietnam after the war. Featuring specially commissioned full-color artwork and period and close-up photographs, this is the story of the origins, combat use, and lasting influence of two of World War II's most famous firearms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b41c5cd81dcdc9e1534bb733778c91cda35fc21","amp;dn":"MP+38+and+MP+40+Submachine+Guns+%28WPN+31%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b41c5cd81dcdc9e1534bb733778c91cda35fc21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,65,197,205,129,220,220,158,21,52,187,115,55,120,201,28,218,53,252,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
