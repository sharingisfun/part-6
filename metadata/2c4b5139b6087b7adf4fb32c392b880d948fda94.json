This first volume of six takes us from the time that England was first settled, more than 15,000 years ago, to the death in 1509 of the first Tudor monarch, Henry VII.\nIn it, Ackroyd takes us from Neolithic England, which we can only see in the most tantalising glimpses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a stirrup found in a grave, some seeds at the bottom of a bowl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to the long period of Roman rule; from the Dark Ages when England was invaded by a ceaseless tide of Angles, Saxons and Jutes, to the twin glories of medieval England Ã¢â‚¬â€œ its great churches and monasteries and its common law. With his extraordinary skill for evoking time and place, he tells the familiar story of king succeeding king in rich prose, with profound insight and some surprising details. The food we ate, the clothes we wore, the punishments we endured, even the jokes we told are all found here, too.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\n*Starred Review* The first volume of AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prospective six-tome history of England extends from Stonehenge to the extinction of the Plantagenet dynasty by Henry Tudor. The strongest impression Ackroyd acquired from his survey of land and time is that of the role that habit, custom, and contingency plays in shaping history. He repeatedly repudiates a view of English history as a conscious progression toward, for example, Parliament. Similar institutions associated with England, such as Christianity and common law, arise as incremental accretions in AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accounts. His treatment of 1066 is characteristic. He concedes the consequentiality of the Norman conquest while emphasizing the persistence of native modes of life, such as the vernacular language that eventually, albeit not for three centuries, with Chaucer, supplanted the invadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ French as the language of society and the governing elite. The battles for the crown supply most of AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative, but while the Hundred YearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ War and the Wars of the Roses rumble on, the peasants till the soil, quaff ale, and periodically raise pitchforks and torches. The hugely popular AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ease of erudition ought not to be missed. --Gilbert Taylor\n\nReviews\nPraise for Foundation:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ackroyd has drawn a large, loyal readership in his native land. Over some 50 books, he has seldom strayed far from the subject of the past and the traces it has left in the present.
