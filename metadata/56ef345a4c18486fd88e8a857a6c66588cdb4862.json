Despite statements to the contrary in the movie, the story is completely fictional. Patty Hearst, Suzanne Somers, Joan Rivers, Traci Lords and Brigid Berlin make cameo appearances in the film.\n\nMovies by Waters' creative influences, including Russ Meyer, Otto Preminger, William Castle, and Herschell Gordon Lewis, are seen playing on television sets throughout the film.\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThough the beginning of the movie says that everything in it is true, when questioned John Waters said he made it up, as a gag.\n\nThe films which Waters made in the eighties and early ninetes, such as Hairspray and Cry-Baby, were slightly less harsh-edged than his eadiest work. In Serial Mom, he harks back in terms of violence to those earliest projects, although in other ways he moves more directly towards the commercial mainstream. Serial Mom particularly recalls Multiple Maniacs, which was inspired by the Sharon Tate murder and featured Divine as a mass murderer who dailies en route to damnation with a perverted nun. No Divine this time, but rather Kathleen Turner as an apparently immaculate mother and housekeeper who, as the title suggests, has latent psychotic tendencies.\n\nAs it has in common with his earliest films a tendency towards grotesquely and blackly humorous murders, Serial Mom matches Water's more recent work in terms of being slick and stylish. Turner is good as a sort of twisted Hyacinth Bucket with teeth, and the usual catchy sound track of Water's films adds to the fun. Waters, in some ways a Russ Meyer sans mammary obsession, here largely succeeds in marrying the style of his 1980s and 90s films with the carnal excess of his 70s work if somewhat toned down.\n\nGreat (if dark) fun.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Serial Mom (1994)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Serial Mom (1994)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.19 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 33mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 832 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 33mn\nBit rate                         : 1 499 Kbps\nWidth                            : 708 pixels\nHeight                           : 390 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.614\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.226\nStream size                      : 1 000 MiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 33mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 214 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 287 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5420\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n12/29/2010 9:05:47 PM\nmbam-log-2010-12-29 (21-05-47).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 53 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
