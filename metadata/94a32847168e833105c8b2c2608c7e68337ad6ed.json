The Confession (2:50)\n\nEli and the Thirteenth Confession is a music album by New York-born singer, songwriter, and pianist Laura Nyro.\n\nIt was released in 1968 on the Columbia Records label and became one of the year's underground successes. One critic noted, &quot;the hottest sounds of that summer were Sgt. Pepper and the Laura Nyro record.&quot; The album was written entirely by Nyro, arranged by Charlie Calello and produced by both.\n\nThe album's themes are of passion, love, romance, death, and drugs, and the songs are delivered in Nyro's distinctive brash neo-operatic vocals. Musically, it is a multi-layered and opulent work, with features including a band, multi-tracked vocals, jazz instrumentation and strings. The album's loose genre is pop, but it also incorporates elements of jazz, opera, soul, gospel, and rock.\n\nIt is generally considered to be Nyro's most accessible and most famous work, although it is arguably not the most commercially successful or critically favoured (both honours go to the follow-up, New York Tendaberry). The album was her first chart entry, reaching #189 on the Billboard 200, when it was known as &quot;Pop Albums.&quot;\n\nThe album is second only to its predecessor, 1967's More Than A New Discovery, in producing hit songs for other artists. Three Dog Night took &quot;Eli's Comin'&quot; to US #10, while The Fifth Dimension went to US #3 with &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot; and US #13 with &quot;Sweet Blindness.&quot;\n\nEli and the Thirteenth Confession is also recognised as the first part in a &quot;holy trinity&quot; of Laura Nyro albums[citation needed], the others being New York Tendaberry (1969) and Christmas and the Beads of Sweat (1970).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94a32847168e833105c8b2c2608c7e68337ad6ed","amp;dn":"Laura+Nyro+-+Eli+And+The+Thirteenth+Confession+%5B1968%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94a32847168e833105c8b2c2608c7e68337ad6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,163,40,71,22,142,131,49,5,200,178,194,96,140,126,104,51,122,214,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
