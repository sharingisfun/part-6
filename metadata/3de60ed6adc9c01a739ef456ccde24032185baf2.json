The film features present day immigrant stories, rarely seen archival material, as well as interviews with such respected figures as Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Rigoberta MenchÃƒÂº, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Junot DÃƒÂ­az, Mexican historian Dr. Lorenzo Meyer, journalists Maria Hinojosa and Geraldo Rivera, Grammy award-winning singer Luis Enrique, and poet MartÃƒÂ­n Espada.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de60ed6adc9c01a739ef456ccde24032185baf2","amp;dn":"Harvest+of+Empire%3A+The+Untold+Story+of+Latinos+in+America+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de60ed6adc9c01a739ef456ccde24032185baf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,230,14,214,173,201,192,26,115,158,244,86,204,222,36,3,33,133,186,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
