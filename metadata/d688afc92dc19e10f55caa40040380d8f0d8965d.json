It wasn't until his rediscovery during the 1960s folk revival that his remarkable talent was fully appreciated. Hurt's rediscovery only lasted a few years--he died in 1966--but his legacy, preserved on several albums recorded for Vanguard during that period, is indeed daunting. Hurt's intricate fingerpicking style--evidenced here on popular pieces like &quot;Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor,&quot; &quot;Richland Women Blues,&quot; &quot;Salty Dog Blues,&quot; and &quot;Candy Man&quot;--went on to influence a generation of urban folk and blues artists. His music remains a sweet reminder of the pre-depression-era ragtime blues of which he was a humble and subtle master. --Billy Altman\n\n\nMississippi John Hurt\n\n\nAvalon Blues: The Complete 1928 OKEH Recordings\n\nThe Complete Studio Recordings:\n Today\n The Immortal John Hurt\n Last Sessions\n\nD.C.
