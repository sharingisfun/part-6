Riveting and heartbreaking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€GERALDINE BROOKS, author of *CalebÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crossing*\n\nShe still had time before work. She could go food shopping. She could fold the kidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ laundry and get the car washed and return some library books. Or Hannah could do something else. She could do something that she had never done--drive to a part of town where she had never been, pretend to be someone that she was not.\n\nHannah was tall and graceful, naturally pretty, spirited and impulsive, the upper-class young woman who picked, of all men, Lovell--the introverted climate scientist who thought he could change the world if he could just get everyone to listen to reason. After a magical honeymoon, they settled in the suburbs to raise their two children.\n\nBut over the years, Lovell and HannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversations have become charged with resentments and unspoken desires. She has become withdrawn. His work affords him a convenient distraction. And then, after one explosive argument, Hannah vanishes.\n\nFor the first time, Lovell is forced to examine the trajectory of his marriage through the lens of memory. As he tries to piece together what happened to his wife--and to their life together--readers follow Hannah on that single day when a hasty decision proves irrevocable.\n\nWith haunting intensity, a seamless balance of wit and heartbreak, and the emotional acuity that author Heidi Pitlor brings to every page, The Daylight Marriage mines the dark and delicate nature of a marriage.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In The Daylight Marriage, there are two mysteries--the whereabouts of a missing woman and the vagaries of the human heart. Heidi Pitlor explores both of these enigmas with equal mastery, merging a shocking crime story with an incisive portrait of a failed marriage. The result is a novel that is fast-moving, emotionally complex, and ultimately heartbreaking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Tom Perrotta, author of *Nine Inches*\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Pitlor brings forth the emotions that surge beneath the surface with the precision and power of a conductor . . . This powerful analysis of how dreams become nightmares will make readers want to hold their loved ones close.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist, starred review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efbe62c187a2f00e9e3350d95809efff4f4f957e","amp;dn":"The+Daylight+Marriage+-+Heidi+Pitlor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efbe62c187a2f00e9e3350d95809efff4f4f957e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,190,98,193,135,162,240,14,158,51,80,217,88,9,239,255,79,79,149,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
