The Superman-in-flight scenes are animations, in part due to the small production budget.\n\nSuperman was a &quot;tremendous financial success&quot; and played in &quot;first-run theatres that had never before booked a serial.&quot; \n\nThe serial was a popular success that made Kirk Alyn famous and launched Noel Neill's career.\n \nA sequel serial, Atom Man vs. Superman, also directed by Bennet, was released in 1950.\n\nCAST:-\nKirk Alyn..............

After his foster parents die, the Man of Steel heads to Metropolis under the bespectacled guise of Kent and joins the staff of the Daily Planet in order to be close to the news. Whenever emergencies happen, he responds in his true identity as Superman. This first serial revolves around the nefarious plot of a villain who calls herself the Spider Lady.\n\nPRODUCTION\nRepublic Pictures tried twice to produce a Superman serial. The first attempt was replaced by Mysterious Doctor Satan (1940), when licensing negotiations with Superman publisher National Comics (later called DC Comics) failed. A second attempt was advertised for a 1941 release; but this time, two obstacles doomed production. National Comics insisted on absolute control of the script and production; and, the rights to Superman were already committed to the Paramount cartoon series.[1] Sam Katzman acquired the live-action rights in 1947. He tried to sell them to Universal, but they no longer made serials by then. He also tried to sell to Republic; but, they claimed that &quot;a superpowerful flying hero would be impossible to adapt&quot; -- despite having already successfully done just that in 1940 with The Adventures of Captain Marvel. Also, Republic was no longer buying properties for adaptation by 1947. Columbia accepted.\n\nSam Katzman found Kirk Alyn after looking through photographs, but had a hard time selling the idea of casting Alyn to Whitney Ellsworth, National Comics' representative on the project. This was made even worse when Alyn came in for a screen test, sporting a goatee and moustache (as he was also shooting another project, a historical film). These initial reservations were eventually overcome, and Alyn got the part. Columbia's advertising claimed that it could not get an actor to fill the role, so it had &quot;hired Superman himself&quot;; and, Kirk Alyn was merely playing just Clark Kent.\n\nGeorge Plympton added a joke to script, substituting the Lone Ranger's &quot;Hi-Yo Silver!&quot; for the traditional &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;. This did not survive in the script long enough to actually be filmed. The Superman costume was grey and brown, instead of blue and red, because those colors photographed better on black and white film.\n\nSuperman's flight sequences were animated instead of live-action or model work. Harmon and Glut consider this to be the &quot;weakest point of the serial&quot;, explaining that the &quot;effects created by Republic for Captain Marvel were very convincing; even the more routine ones for the Superman TV series, always showing the same pose, were better.&quot;[1] While there were other effective special effects, in their opinion, they were undermined by the poorness of the flying sequences. The film crew did test an alternate method of filming the flying sequences: Kirk Alyn spent an entire day painfully suspended by visible wires in front of a rear projection of moving clouds. Displeased with the results, Katzman fired the entire flight sequence production staff and used the animated method instead\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 244 mins\nSubtitles: ENGLISH, SPANISH, FRENCH\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 244 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f197071fc9fd7d0575dfb9b2666ba6a98cd37a4e","amp;dn":"Superman+%281948%29+Xvid+-+Theatrical+Serial+-+All+15+Chapters+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f197071fc9fd7d0575dfb9b2666ba6a98cd37a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,151,7,31,201,253,125,5,117,223,185,178,102,107,166,169,140,211,122,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
