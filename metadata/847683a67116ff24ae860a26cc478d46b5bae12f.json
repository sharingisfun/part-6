Yet cleaning products are exempt from the full ingredient disclosure on product labels as required for food and personal care products and enter the marketplace with little or no testing for potential health risks.\n\nNaturally Clean explains the dangers of traditional cleaners and provides illuminating statistics that illustrate how the chemicals found in almost every home are known or likely to cause a host of serious health problems. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy-to-understand introduction discusses basic household chemistry, concepts of toxicity and types of toxic exposure, and the difference between natural, organic, and synthetic chemicals.\n\nA room-by-room guide provides tips for:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A healthier kitchen\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Keeping your bedrooms safe\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mold, mildew, and soap scum: spotless bathrooms\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Special precautions for cleaning childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rooms\n\nNaturally Clean also features a comprehensive product selection guide that analyzes over 300 natural and traditional cleaners: everything from laundry products through oven cleaners, disinfectants, spot removers, carpet cleaners, and bathroom cleaners. This handy, easy-to-use reference rates the household cleaning products found on the shelves of natural food and grocery stores, providing Seventh GenerationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pick of your healthiest and safest options. A resource guide tells readers where to find additional information, and an at-a-glance glossary helps understand key terms.\n\nRoyalties from the sale of Naturally Clean will benefit the Children's Health Environmental Coalition (www.checnet.org) in their efforts to educate parents about environmental toxins that can affect children's health.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847683a67116ff24ae860a26cc478d46b5bae12f","amp;dn":"Naturally+Clean%3A+The+Seventh+Generation+Guide+to+Safe+And+Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847683a67116ff24ae860a26cc478d46b5bae12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,118,131,166,113,22,255,36,174,134,10,38,204,71,141,70,181,186,225,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
