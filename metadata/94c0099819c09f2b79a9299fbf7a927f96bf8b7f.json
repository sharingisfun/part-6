You can spend hours trying to enhance it, or you can replace it in just a few simple steps. Chris Orwig shows you how in this Portrait Project. He'll show you how to make and refine a selection, mask out the sky, and insert a new, more dramatic skyÃ¢â‚¬â€all in Adobe Photoshop. In order to make your replacement look natural, Chris spends the second half of the course showing how to improve the detail, color, and tone of your new composite.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c0099819c09f2b79a9299fbf7a927f96bf8b7f","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Portrait+Project%3A+Changing+a+Sky+Background+with+Chris+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c0099819c09f2b79a9299fbf7a927f96bf8b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,192,9,152,25,192,159,43,121,169,41,159,191,122,146,127,150,191,139,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
