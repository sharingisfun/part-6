It is thought to have been the inspiration behind the swirling patterns of van Gogh's Starry Night, and ever since it has fascinated astronomers and star watchers.\r\n\r\nSo for this month's Sky at Night we have declared June 1st Whirlpool Galaxy Day. On this one day we will be aiming as many telescopes as possible at the galaxy. Images will be taken by optical and infra-red telescopes on top of volcanoes in Hawaii and La Palma, the radio signature will be captured at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, and in orbit the Swift space telescope will aim its ultraviolet and X-ray sensors at the galaxy.\r\n\r\nBy examining the galaxy at as many magnifications and wavelengths as possible the programme will build up a portrait of this galaxy - unlocking the secrets of the formation of the spiral arms and revealing how they have triggered a wave of intense star formation.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1200Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 277 MB\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d09b27a0d2003b234f677028e54ac123248214b","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Whirlpool+Galaxy+720p+HDTV+x265-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d09b27a0d2003b234f677028e54ac123248214b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,9,178,122,13,32,3,178,52,246,119,2,142,84,172,18,50,72,33,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
