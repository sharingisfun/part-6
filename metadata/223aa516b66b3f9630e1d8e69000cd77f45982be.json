Featuring 30 case studies on brands and wine regions around the world - all based on the same principles - it presents a successful, cutting-edge strategy for the marketing of wine. Rather than focusing on a small group of elitist appellations, the Grand Crus universe and a handful of star brands, the book addresses the real, day-to-day wine world. In light of globalization, it introduces state-of-the-art wine positioning techniques, with an emphasis on the identity, segmentation and positioning of wine appellations and wine brands. In its analysis of wine appellation models, the book examines local parameters like geology, history and wine growing techniques; compares facts, figures and actors; analyzes the signals that are being sent to the market and presents a range of key factors for success. Similarly, the wine brands models are analyzed on the basis of their respective brand identity and apparent marketing policy. In the bookâ€™s final part, it summarizes recent developments in wine marketing, including the growing importance of wine brands as new territories in the global vineyard, and the role of appellations as the essence of cultural diversity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223aa516b66b3f9630e1d8e69000cd77f45982be","amp;dn":"Wine+Positioning+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223aa516b66b3f9630e1d8e69000cd77f45982be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,58,165,22,182,107,63,150,48,225,216,230,144,0,205,119,244,89,130,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
