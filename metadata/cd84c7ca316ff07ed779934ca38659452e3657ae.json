The band went on hiatus for a while, guitarist Adam Haworth Stephens and drummer Tyson Vogel each released solo albums, and in 2010, Stephens nearly lost his life in a van accident while on tour in Wyoming. Returning to active duty in 2012, Two Gallants are a changed band on The Bloom and the Blight, or at the very least, they've given their studio approach a serious overhaul. On their first three albums, Two Gallants performed with a scrappy immediacy that was informed by both country and indie rock, like the quieter, bass-less children of Uncle Tupelo, but The Bloom and the Blight is the work of a band that has come to rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd84c7ca316ff07ed779934ca38659452e3657ae","amp;dn":"Two+Gallants+-+The+Bloom+and+the+Blight+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd84c7ca316ff07ed779934ca38659452e3657ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,132,199,202,49,111,240,126,215,121,147,76,163,134,89,69,46,54,87,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
