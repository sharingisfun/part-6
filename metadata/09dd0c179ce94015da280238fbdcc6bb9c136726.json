Run applications in Linux, Windows, and more   |\n       |  at the same time on the same PC with no rebooting. Evaluate  |\n       |  and test new operating systems, applications and patches in  |\n       |  an isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software        |\n       |  applications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable    |\n       |  manner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and    |\n       |  the SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to       |\n       |  debug applications on multiple platforms.                    |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  * More Reasons at a Glance                                   |\n       |  Seamlessly Integrated:                                       |\n       |  Unity mode integrates applications from within your Windows  |\n       |  &amp; Linux virtual machines and makes them appear like they     |\n       |  are running on your native desktop. User friendly features   |\n       |  such as the ability to cut and paste pictures, drag and      |\n       |  drop email attachments, and driver-less printing make it     |\n       |  easy to work in a virtual machine.                           |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  Snapshots and Clones: The Ultimate Time Saver                |\n       |  Snapshots preserve the state of a virtual machine so you     |\n       |  can return to it at any time. Snapshots are useful when you  |\n       |  need to revert your virtual machine to a prior, stable       |\n       |  system state. Workstation makes it easy to find and revert   |\n       |  to a previously saved snapshot.                              |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  Installing operating systems and applications can be time    |\n       |  consuming. With clones, you can make many copies of a        |\n       |  virtual machine from the baseline installation and           |\n       |  configuration. This makes it fast and simple to maintain     |\n       |  standardized computing environments for employees and        |\n       |  students, or to create a baseline configuration for          |\n       |  testing.                                                     |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  Run Multi-tiered Applications on a Single PC                 |\n       |  Manage multiple, network-connected virtual machines with     |\n       |  Teams.

Test   |\n       |  your applications in a virtual machine while recording and   |\n       |  then let the developer step through the recording with a     |\n       |  debugger attached. Never again will there be a non-          |\n       |  reproducible bug.                                            |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  INSTALL NOTES:                                               |\n       |                                                               |\n       |  Use the included keymaker to register ...                    |\n       |                                                             __|__ __\n       |_                      E n j o y . . .                      /    \\ `\n       |_|_____________________________________________________  __/  ____\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09dd0c179ce94015da280238fbdcc6bb9c136726","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+v10+0+4+Incl+Keymaker-EMBRACE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09dd0c179ce94015da280238fbdcc6bb9c136726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,221,12,23,156,233,64,21,218,40,2,56,251,220,198,187,156,19,103,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
