Johansson, P. Somasundaran (Elsevier, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nThe focus of Handbook for Cleaning/Decontamination of Surfaces lies on cleaning and decontamination of surfaces and solid matter, hard as well as soft. Bringing together in a 2-volume reference source: \r\n- current knowledge of the physico-chemical fundamentals underlying the cleaning process; \r\n- the different needs for cleaning and how these needs are met by various types of cleaning processes and cleaning agents, including novel approaches; \r\n- how to test that cleaning has taken place and to what extent; \r\n- the effects of cleaning on the environment; \r\n- future trends in cleaning and decontamination, for example the idea of changing surfaces, to hinder the absorbance of dirt and thus make cleaning easier. \r\nA brief introduction is given to the legal demands concerning the environment and a historical background, in terms of development of detergents, from soaps to the modern sophisticated formulations. Bactericides, their use and the environmental demands on them are covered. Thorough discussions of mechanisms for cleaning are given in several chapters, both general basic concepts and special cases like particle cleaning and cleaning using microemulsion concepts.\r\n\r\n* General understanding of how cleaning works, function of ingredients and formulations \r\n* Overview of environmental issues and demands from the society in the area \r\n* Gives basic formulas for cleaning preparations in most areas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eee5f4221764bf56f9c77ab5565a3e69f40a70e","amp;dn":"Handbook+for+Cleaning_Decontamination+of+Surfaces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eee5f4221764bf56f9c77ab5565a3e69f40a70e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,238,95,66,33,118,75,245,111,156,119,171,85,101,163,230,159,64,167,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
