The bold new sound of ragtime music arrived on our shores from America and paved the way for wave after wave of new dances that would take the dance floor by storm.\r\nLen gets to grips with quirky animal dances before exploring how a young couple called the Castles found fame as the first dancing screen icons. Lucy discovers how, whilst many people lapped up the new American imports, one woman saved that most English tradition, morris dancing, from extinction.\r\nThe First World War marked a pivotal moment - after the armistice everyone wanted to dance and Britain was swept up in the greatest dance boom the country had ever known. Palais de Danse opened across the country and for the first time dancing became a big business opportunity, with the dancing public holding sway over what was in or out of fashion on the dance floor.\r\nLen and Lucy explore how we danced in interwar Britain and how women's new-found freedoms were epitomised by the iconic and reckless dancing girl, the flapper. They visit that most famous dance floor, the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, to examine how dancing professionals sought to take back control with standardisation of music and dancing.\r\nFinally, under the tutelage of Darren Royston, historical dance teacher at RADA, Lucy and Len put together one final performance of the most iconic dance from the era, the Charleston, in full period costume in front of a crowd at the famous Cafe de Paris in London.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.25 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04pztc3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10669f308cb171c43a0772868139671def5436fd","amp;dn":"BBC+Dancing+Cheek+to+Cheek+3of3+The+Shock+of+the+New+720p+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10669f308cb171c43a0772868139671def5436fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,102,159,48,140,177,113,196,58,7,114,134,129,57,103,29,239,84,54,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
