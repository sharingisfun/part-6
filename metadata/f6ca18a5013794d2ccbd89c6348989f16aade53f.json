Perhaps the greatest of these is Professor James Moriarty. Fiercely intelligent and a relentless schemer, Professor Moriarty is the perfect foil to the inimitable Sherlock Holmes, whose crime-solving acumen could only be as brilliant as Moriartyâ€™s cunning. \r\nWhile â€œthe Napoleon of crimeâ€ appeared in only two of Conan Doyleâ€™s original stories, Moriartyâ€™s enigma is finally revealed in this diverse anthology of thirty-seven new Moriarty stories, reimagined and retold by leading crime writers such as Martin Edwards, JÃ¼rgen Ehlers, Barbara Nadel, L. C. Tyler, Michael Gregorio, Alison Joseph and Peter Guttridge. In these intelligent, compelling storiesâ€”some frightening and others humorousâ€”Moriarty is brought back vividly to new life, not simply as an incarnation of pure evil but also as a fallible human being with personality, motivations, and subtle shades of humanity. \r\nFilling the gaps of the Conan Doyle canon, The Mammoth Book of the Adventures of Professor Moriarty is a must-read for any fan of the Sherlock Holmesâ€™s legacy. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ca18a5013794d2ccbd89c6348989f16aade53f","amp;dn":"The+Mammoth+Book+of+the+Adventures+of+Professor+Moriarty+-+Maxim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ca18a5013794d2ccbd89c6348989f16aade53f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,202,24,165,1,55,148,210,204,189,137,198,52,137,137,241,106,173,229,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
