HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprised when fellow Sidewinder Nick OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Flaherty stays with him in New Orleans. Nor is he surprised when Nick travels home with him to help him get back on his feetÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, years on the same Marine Force Recon team bonded the men in ways that only bleeding for a brother can. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very surprised, though, when Nick humors his moment of curiosity and kisses him.\n\nNick knows all of KellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quirks and caprices, so the kiss was a low-risk move on his part . . . or so he thought. But what shouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a simple moment unleashes a flood of confusing emotions and urges that neither man is prepared to address.\n\nNow, Kelly and Nick must figure out what they mean to each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€friends and brothers in arms, or something even deeper?Ã¢â‚¬â€before the past can come back to ruin their tenuous future.\n\n[img]https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1392033679l/20764021.jpg[/img]\n\nWhen Nick O'Flaherty arrives at the scene of a double homicide to find he has a witness to the crime, he thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his lucky day. But when he realizes his witness is suffering from amnesia and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even remember his own name, Nick wishes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d gone with his gut and put in for vacation time.\n\nThen NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend and former Recon teammate, Kelly Abbott, joins him in Boston, and Nick finds his hands a little too full as the case and his personal life collide. The witness heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Å“JDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is being tailed by Julian Cross, a retired CIA hitman. To complicate matters further, JD forms an attachment to Nick that Nick struggles not to respond to as they search for the key to JDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity.\n\nTrying to determine whether JD is friend or foe as they investigate the crime puts them on the trail of a much older mystery. When multiple attempts are made on their lives, Nick is forced to turn to old enemies and new allies to solve a centuries-old crime before he and Kelly get added to the history books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa8b35bc089df2a61e0cf0bbcd0ed65dccd324d","amp;dn":"Shock+Awe+Cross+Crown+Sidewinder+Series+%28Abigail+Roux%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa8b35bc089df2a61e0cf0bbcd0ed65dccd324d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,168,179,91,192,137,223,42,97,224,207,11,188,208,237,101,220,205,50,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
