Arctic - Life in the Deep Freeze\nThe Arctic is the harshest environment on Earth: little food grows, it's dark for months on end, and temperatures stay well below freezing for much of the year. Yet four million people manage to survive here. Human Planet tells remarkable stories of extraordinary people who make their homes in nature's deep freeze.\n\nIn springtime, Amos and Karl-Frederik set out across the sea ice with their dogs to catch a real-life sea monster: a Greenland shark! Inuit mussel-gatherers venture underneath the sea ice at low tide for a perilous race against time as they gather their food.\n\nAnd the children of Churchill, Manitoba, set out on the most dangerous trick or treating Halloween in the world: they risk coming face-to-face with deadly polar bears on the streets of their town. Who'll get the tastiest snack?\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid available from MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1519750687f192bf2d31ee22f62feecf3f22c4d8","amp;dn":"BBC+Human+Planet+3of8+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1519750687f192bf2d31ee22f62feecf3f22c4d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,25,117,6,135,241,146,191,45,49,238,34,246,47,238,207,63,34,196,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
