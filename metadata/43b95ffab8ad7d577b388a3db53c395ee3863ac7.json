I personally vote X-Com TFTD as the best game ever made. You have to get over the fact that it&amp;#039;s really old, but it&amp;#039;s certainly worth playing in the 21st century, too.\n\nIn my country, it&amp;#039;s legal to download this game if you own it. Last thing I checked, you can buy it with Steam as well.\n\nThanks a lot to starwindz for releasing this Total Pack!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b95ffab8ad7d577b388a3db53c395ee3863ac7","amp;dn":"X-Com%3A+UFO+%26+TFTD+Total+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b95ffab8ad7d577b388a3db53c395ee3863ac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,185,95,250,184,173,125,87,123,56,138,61,181,60,57,94,227,134,58,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
