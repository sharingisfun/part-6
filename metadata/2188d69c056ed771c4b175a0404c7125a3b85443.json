Do you get angry at yourself for falling back into old patterns?\nOn this enlightening CD, Louise L. Hay discusses the difficulties you may encounter when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going through a period of &quot;change and transition.&quot; She assures you that anything new that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re learning can take time to get accustomed to, and that when you fall back into old patterns, you must &quot;build yourself up&quot; instead of &quot;beat yourself up.&quot; Louise closes the lecture with a beautiful and empowering meditation.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nLouise L.
