Can an atheist or agnostic follow the BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachings without believing in reincarnation or organized religion?\n\nThis is one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confession.\n\nIn his classic Buddhism Without Beliefs, Stephen Batchelor offered a profound, secular approach to the teachings of the Buddha that struck an emotional chord with Western readers. Now, with the same brilliance and boldness of thought, he paints a groundbreaking portrait of the historical BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬â€told from the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique perspective as a former Buddhist monk and modern seeker. Drawing from the original Pali Canon, the seminal collection of Buddhist discourses compiled after the BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death by his followers, Batchelor shows us the Buddha as a flesh-and-blood man who looked at life in a radically new way. Batchelor also reveals the everyday challenges and doubts of his own devotional journeyÃ¢â‚¬â€from meeting the Dalai Lama in India, to training as a Zen monk in Korea, to finding his path as a lay teacher of Buddhism living in France. Both controversial and deeply personal, Stephen BatchelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refreshingly doctrine-free, life-informed account is essential reading for anyone interested in Buddhism.&quot;\n\nReview sample from Western Buddhism Review - &quot;This Ã¢â‚¬ËœconfessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is quite a revelation. First, it suggests that BatchelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, like his writing style and his Buddhism, is profoundly individualistic: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just his take on things. Second, his attitude to Buddhism is completely pragmatic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he treats it as Ã¢â‚¬ËœtrueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ only insofar as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœit worksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and is useful. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœmemoirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ part of his Confession is thus an account of how he became an individualist pragmatic kind of Buddhist, and the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdeclaration of faithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ part of his Confession is an attempt to read this kind of Buddhism back into the life and teaching of the Buddha.&quot;\n\nThe full review is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thebuddhistcentre.com/westernbuddhistreview/review-confessions-buddhist-atheist-stephen-batchelor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thebuddhistcentre.com/westernbuddhistreview/review-confessions-buddhist-atheist-stephen-batchelor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe torrent contains the front cover (above) and both the PDF and EPUB copies of the book.
