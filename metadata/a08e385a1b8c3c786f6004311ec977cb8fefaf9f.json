Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 6,500 kbps in a High Quality 4.73 GB 720p H264 AVCHD MP4 release with 48khz 384 kbps Dolby Digital AC3 5.1 channel surround sound audio. show runtime is 2 Hours 35 minutes 25 seconds.\n \nThis is my 174th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show music fans. \n\nThis release will fit on 1 DVD +R DL disc or a 8 GB USB flash drive. This release is in H264 AVCHD MKV format with Dolby Digital AC3 5.1 channel surround sound audio and is playable with Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, and any BluRay players or other devices capable of playing 720p HD .mkv video files.\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nOnce installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:\n\nMedia Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. \n\nVLC player doesnt play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to 2 DVD -R  discs or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP620 3D BluRay player does.\n\nTo get VLC player to play MKV files:\n\nYou can speed up the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback by disabling loop filter for H.264 decoding. To do this go to Tools - Preferences and Input / Codecs and in the drop-down box for Skip H.264 in-loop deblocking filter change it to All. Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.\n\nAlso if you have a multicore CPU (or one with Intel Hyper-Threading), you can lower the FFMPEG thread count. To do this go to Tools - Preferences (Show settings: All), then Input / Codecs - Video codecs - FFmpeg, then locate Threads, and set it to 4 (or to 2, or to 1). (put a check into the Hardware decoding box) Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.\n\nEnjoy Rolling Stones One More Shot Live music fans and thanks for downloading my Rolling Stones One More Shot Live 2012-12-15 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.\n\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on ThePirateBay.se and KickAss Torrents\n\n\nStoneCold420 \nSmackDownHotel\nDecember 15, 2012\n\n\nFor 2012 SDH releases from 2012-03-29 onward please check here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&lt;/a&gt;  \n\nSCSA420 and EchoesHub member WoodStock sends out a special shoutout to the International Echoes Hub live music trading internet community.
