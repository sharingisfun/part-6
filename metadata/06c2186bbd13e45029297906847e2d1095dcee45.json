Now part of the Voyager Classics collection.\n\nThe Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up.\n\nBut more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.\n\n---\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nNarrated by: Stephen Hoye\nLength: 9 hrs and 14 mins \nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c2186bbd13e45029297906847e2d1095dcee45","amp;dn":"Ray+Bradbury+-+The+Martian+Chronicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c2186bbd13e45029297906847e2d1095dcee45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,194,24,107,189,19,228,80,41,41,121,6,132,126,45,16,149,220,238,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
