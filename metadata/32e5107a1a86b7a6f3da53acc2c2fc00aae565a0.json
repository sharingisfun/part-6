(note: you can turn subs on or off)\n\nENCODING SETTINGS:\nCRF 19, Ref=8, bframes=8, me=umh, Subme=10, Me_range=32, Trellis=2, b_pyramid=2, b_adapt=2, direct=3, weightb=1, weightp=2, rc_lookahead=100, mixed_ref=1\n\nPlease seed when you are done so I can move on to seeding the next season. A good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRF encoding maintains a constant quality across episodes by adjusting the required file size (bit-rate) to maintain the desired quality. Some scenes/episodes need a higher bit-rate than others. CRF...never underestimate or waste how many bits are used. The high profile x264 settings provide greater compression, while maintaining the crf-19. i.e. CRF-19 at lower x264 settings would have the same quality, but would result in larger files.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~No: 350mb, x-vid, mp3 files here.\n~Always: Untouched ac3 audio, full resolution video, high-profile x264 settings, Larger files (only) when needed.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e5107a1a86b7a6f3da53acc2c2fc00aae565a0","amp;dn":"The.X-Files.Season.3.x264.dolby.AC3.subs-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e5107a1a86b7a6f3da53acc2c2fc00aae565a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,229,16,122,26,134,183,166,243,218,83,172,194,194,252,0,170,229,101,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
