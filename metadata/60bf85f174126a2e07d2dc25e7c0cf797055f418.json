Then there is the influence of the minimalist Krautrock of mid-1970s Germany. And finally, there are the American elements of old-style funk and Velvet Underground simplicity. What binds together this United nations of sound on Emperor Tomato Ketchup is clever production - a unique multilayered sound that incorporates various textures (including strings, vocal harmonies, and electronica) with crystal-clear perfection.\n\nNME called the band a &quot;motley crew of English secondhand record dweebs, French political, er lecturers, and instrumental boffins.&quot; But the album's broad experimental sound is an indisputably enjoyable adventure. The album opens with its strongest track &quot;Metronomic Underground,&quot; in which Sadier repeats the meaningless line &quot;Crazy, sturdy, a torpedo,&quot; for most of the eight-minute track while the music underneath her vocals builds Lip from a simple funk groove to a loud and feverish guitarlsynth ending. &quot;Tomorrow Is Already Here&quot; is reminiscent of Nico-era Velvet underground with broad spaces between the guitars and organ.\n\nIn many ways, Emperor Tomato Ketchup was an ambitious effort at making forgotten sounds and ideologies contemporary again. And in their own eccentric fashion, Stereolab pull it off to a tee.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01 - Stereolab - Metronomic Underground.flac\n02 - Stereolab - Cybele's Reverie.flac\n03 - Stereolab - Percolator.flac\n04 - Stereolab - Les Yper-Sound.flac\n05 - Stereolab - Spark Plug.flac\n06 - Stereolab - Olv 26.flac\n07 - Stereolab - The Noise Of Carpet.flac\n08 - Stereolab - Tomorrow Is Already Here.flac\n09 - Stereolab - Emperor Tomato Ketchup.flac\n10 - Stereolab - Monstre Sacre.flac\n11 - Stereolab - Motoroller Scalatron.flac\n12 - Stereolab - Slow Fast Hazel.flac\n13 - Stereolab - Anonymous Collective.flac\n\nÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ripping Log IncludedÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60bf85f174126a2e07d2dc25e7c0cf797055f418","amp;dn":"Stereolab+-+Emperor+Tomato+Ketchup+%5B1996%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60bf85f174126a2e07d2dc25e7c0cf797055f418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,191,133,241,116,18,106,46,7,210,220,37,231,192,207,121,112,85,244,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
