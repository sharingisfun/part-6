The authors, two leading French authorities, review their subject in its global settingÃ¢â‚¬â€from the sculpture of ancient and classical lands to that of the great European centers, from the works of Asia and Africa to those of pre-Columbian America and the modern world. Sculptural movements covered range from primitive trends to the breakthroughs of the Renaissance, from neo-classicism and romanticism to cubism, futurism and abstraction. Giants such as Michelangelo, Donatello and Rodin head the cavalcade of sculptors. More than 200 illustrations, many in full color, accompany the text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d888013618e276a42e2ac5294ed306976679134","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Sculpture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d888013618e276a42e2ac5294ed306976679134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,136,128,19,97,142,39,106,66,226,172,82,148,237,48,105,118,103,145,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
