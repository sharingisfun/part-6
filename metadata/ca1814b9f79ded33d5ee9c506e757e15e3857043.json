Miller formed a blues band, the Marksmen Combo, at age 12 with friend Boz Scaggs; the two teamed up again at the University of Wisconsin in a group called the Ardells, later the Fabulous Night Trains. Miller moved to Chicago in 1964 to get involved in the local blues scene, teaming with Barry Goldberg for two years.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Take The Money And Run\n02.Abracadabra\n03.Rockin' Me\n04.Swingtown\n05.The Joker\n06.Livin' In The USA\n07.Space Intro\n08.Fly Like An Eagle\n09.Threshold\n10.Jet Airliner\n11.Space Cowboy\n12.Jungle Love\n13.Serenade\n14.Cry Cry Cry\n15.Shubada Du Ma Ma\n16.Wide River\n17.Wild Mountain Honey\n18.The Stake\n19.My Dark Hour\n20.Who Do You Love\n21.I Want To Make The World Turn Around\n22.Dance Dance Dance\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1814b9f79ded33d5ee9c506e757e15e3857043","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+-+Complete+Greatest+Hits+%282003%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1814b9f79ded33d5ee9c506e757e15e3857043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,24,20,185,247,157,237,51,213,238,156,80,110,117,126,21,227,133,112,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
