This new edition contains an overview of the fundamental concepts and practices of security management while offering important insights into the CPP exam.\n\nUntil recently the security profession was regarded as a &quot;necessary evil.&quot; This book is a comprehensive guide to a profession that is now considered critical to our well-being in the wake of 9/11. It presents a practical approach drawn from decades of combined experience shared by the authors, prepares the reader for the CPP exam, and walks them through the certification process.\n\nThis edition gives revised and updated treatment of every subject in the CPP exam, encourages and outlines a three-part program for you to follow, and includes sample questions at the end of each area of study. Although these are not questions that appear on the actual exam, they convey the principles and concepts that the exam emphasizes and are valuable in determining if you have mastered the information. The book also includes a security survey that covers all facets of external and internal security, as well as fire prevention. The Complete Guide for CPP Examination Preparation, Second Edition allows you to move steadily forward along your path to achieving one of the most highly regarded certifications in the security industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029a8077c649f8542ed03337fb7dfeabf06f7d0f","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+for+CPP+Examination+Preparation%2C+2nd+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029a8077c649f8542ed03337fb7dfeabf06f7d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,154,128,119,198,73,248,84,46,208,51,55,251,125,254,171,240,111,125,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
