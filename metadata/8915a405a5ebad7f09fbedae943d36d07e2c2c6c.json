With a lineage dating back to the cream of hard rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, The Who and Deep Purple and songwriting greats such as The Kinks, The Beatles and The Faces Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound is a timeless marriage of unforgettable melodies and sheer rock power. Their long-awaited return with Ã¢â‚¬ËœWonder DaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ should ensure that Thunder are elevated to their rightful place in the pantheon of truly great British bands.\n\n\nIn parts a rumination and reflection on the dreams and desires of young men growing up in the 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s that inspired the band members to form their first band in their early teens, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWonder DaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is also a potent mix of blues, soul and rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll that is as contemporary as it is steeped in the finest music of the last few decades.\n\n\nFrom the epic Zeppelin-esque title track, through the no-holds-barred pop prowess of potential hit singles Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Thing I WantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœResurrection DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack WaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to the big-screen ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrokenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Thunder have delivered one of the finest rock albums of recent years.\nWhile the galloping drive of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe ProphetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comes on like an unholy union of Iron Maiden and Whitesnake, the sensual Ã¢â‚¬ËœSerpentineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ drips with an archaic Deep South blues vibe before turning into a Royal Blood meets The Raconteurs style stomp. Ã¢â‚¬ËœChasing ShadowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has all the swagger of primetime Aerosmith while the affecting, mandolin-driven folk tinges of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe RainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounds ethereally ageless.\n\nThroughout the album Danny BowesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocals showcase just why he is one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation; a true foil to guitarist Luke MorleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerhouse riffs, scintillating melodies and delicate acoustic strumming.\n\n\nThough making a good recovery from the tonsil cancer that excluded him from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent live appearances, rhythm guitarist Ben Matthews has been sadly absent from the sessions so Morley has taken charge of all the guitars and keyboards on the album, with the ever-present Harry James on drums and long-term bassist Chris Childs on bass providing the striking rhythmic back-bone to the band.\n\n\nRecorded at the legendary Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, with Luke Morley reprising his role as producer, the album was recorded by Nick Brine (Oasis, The Darkness, Ash), and mixed by the renowned Mike Fraser, whose CV includes such names as Aerosmith, AC/DC and Metallica and who worked on several of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key early records including their celebrated debut, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBack Street SymphonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\nThunder hit the road in March with dates in Leeds, Birmingham and London, with Reef and Tax The Heat as support.\n\n\n\nimage\n\nLine-Up:\nDanny Bowes - lead vocals\nLuke Morley - guitar, vocals\nGary 'Harry' James - drums, percussion\n- guitar, keyboards\nChris Childs - bass guitar\n\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
