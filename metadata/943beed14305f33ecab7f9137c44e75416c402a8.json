This phenomenal little label from Memphis, TN ended up producing, almost metaphysically, most of the greatest soul, indeed pop, records of the era in the opinion of many a critic. On top of the famous tracks by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Booker T. and The M.G.s, Albert King, etc. there were a whole slew of unrecognized outstanding artists like Mable John, Carla Thomas, The Barkays, and William Bell who probably went unnoticed simply because they were lost in the mass of talent surrounding them. Out of the 240+ tracks here, there are only a couple that arent worth hearing. Needless to say, this is by far my favorite record/box set ever (and I own a lot of them!) Enjoy! \n \n9 Discs, remastered and complete.
