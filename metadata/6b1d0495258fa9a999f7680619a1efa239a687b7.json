You get:\n\n - the first two singles, Tally Ho and Getting Older, and their b-sides\n - the first two EPs, Boodle Boodle Boodle and Great Sounds Great...\n - selected tracks from the first three LPs, Vehicle, Modern Rock, and Unknown Country\n - some early live tracks\n - some out-takes (one from the second EP, four from the second LP)\n - a very early song, Odditty, collected on the Odditties compilation\n\nThe singles and EPs are the classic (subjective), early 80's Clean. A fairly long hiatus stalled the coming of the LPs, released over the course of the 90's. Odditty was covered by Pavement on the &quot;God Save the Clean&quot; tribute album (the track is also now available on Matador's 2008 re-issue of Brighten the Corners, the Nicene Creed Edition).\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1d0495258fa9a999f7680619a1efa239a687b7","amp;dn":"The+Clean+-+Anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1d0495258fa9a999f7680619a1efa239a687b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,29,4,149,37,143,169,169,153,247,104,6,25,161,239,162,57,166,135,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
