Harrison is listed at number 21 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.[6]\n\nAlthough most of The Beatles' songs were written by Lennon and McCartney, Beatle albums generally included one or two of Harrison's own songs, from With The Beatles onwards.[7] His later compositions with The Beatles include &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. By the time of the band's break-up, Harrison had accumulated a backlog of material, which he then released as the acclaimed and successful triple album All Things Must Pass in 1970, from which came two singles: a double A-side single, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; backed with &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, and &quot;What Is Life&quot;. In addition to his solo work, Harrison co-wrote two hits for Ringo Starr, another former Beatle, as well as songs for the Traveling WilburysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the supergroup he formed in 1988 with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison.\n\nHarrison embraced Indian culture and Hinduism in the mid 1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of sitar music and of the Hare Krishna movement. With Ravi Shankar he organised a major charity concert with the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.\n\nBesides being a musician, he was also a record producer and co-founder of the production company HandMade Films. In his work as a film producer, he collaborated with people as diverse as the members of Monty Python and Madonna.[8]\n\nHe was married twice, to model Pattie Boyd from 1966 to 1974, and for 23 years to record company secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias, with whom he had one son, Dhani Harrison. He was a close friend of Eric Clapton. He is the only Beatle to have published an autobiography, with I Me Mine in 1980. Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet It Roll 2009\n\n\n\nLet It Roll: Songs by George Harrison[4] (or Let It Roll: The Music of George Harrison[5]) is the third compilation of George Harrison's music, and the first to span his entire solo career after The Beatles era. The collection was announced on 14 April 2009, the same day Harrison received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was released 16 June 2009, on both[5] Compact Disc and in digital format.[4]\n\nThe album features songs originally released on EMI and Harrison's Dark Horse Records label. All included tracks are presented in digitally remastered form and the collection includes a booklet featuring previously unseen[5] and rare photos.[4]\n\nThe album includes all of Harrison's songs that reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, including &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)&quot;, and &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot;.\n\nThe track list was selected by George Harrison's widow, Olivia Harrison, with some assistance from close friends and family.\n\niTunes exclusively offers the digital album with a previously unreleased bonus track, Harrison's earliest demo version of &quot;Isn't It a Pity.&quot;\n\nReception to the inclusion of live versions of Beatles-era songs &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; were mixed. Some welcomed the songs as essential parts of Harrison's songwriting, yet noticed the quality of the live versions paled in comparison to the original studio recordings. Others compared the inclusion of Beatles material to the ill-received 1976 The Best of George Harrison compilation, of which more than half of the tracks were songs by the Beatles, downplaying the importance of his solo career. Some other critics wondered why Beatles songs were included, yet songs from Harrison's other supergroup Traveling Wilburys (such as &quot;Handle with Care&quot;) were overlooked.\n\nThe album debuted at #4 in the UK (with first week sales of 28,045 copies), becoming Harrison's highest chart position as a solo artist in over 35 years (since 1973's Living in the Material World). In the US, the album debuted at #24, and as of September 17, 2009, has sold over 68,000 copies. Total sales are currently estimated at 250,000 copies worldwide.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (live)\n6.\t&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Any Road&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;This Is Love&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Marwa Blues&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;What Is Life&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Rising Sun&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;When We Was Fab&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Something&quot; (live)\n15.\t&quot;Blow Away&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Cheer Down&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; (live)\n18.\t&quot;I Don't Want to Do It&quot;  \n19.\t&quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; (version one)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8f327ebc83c42950421ab7a81c151a1e478a0c1","amp;dn":"George+Harrison+-+Let+it+Roll+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8f327ebc83c42950421ab7a81c151a1e478a0c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,243,39,235,200,60,66,149,4,33,171,122,129,193,81,161,228,120,160,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
