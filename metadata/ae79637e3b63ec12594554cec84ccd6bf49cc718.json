M. Barrett. The latter was given special permission from President Theodore Roosevelt to interview Geronimo while he was a prisoner of war at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. What Barrett recorded is a blunt, firsthand account of the twenty-five years Geronimo spent fighting the U.S. government.\n\nIn Geronimo, the famous Native American discusses the history of the Apache peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€where they came from, their early life, and their tribal customs and manners. Geronimo expresses his personal views on how the white men who settled in the West negatively affected his tribe, from wrongs done to his people and removal from their homeland to GeronimoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imprisonment and forced surrender.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae79637e3b63ec12594554cec84ccd6bf49cc718","amp;dn":"Geronimo%3A+The+True+Story+of+America%27s+Ferocious+Warrior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae79637e3b63ec12594554cec84ccd6bf49cc718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,121,99,126,59,99,236,18,89,69,84,206,200,76,205,107,244,156,199,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
