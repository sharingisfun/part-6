Dagostino, Joseph B. Wujek | ISBN: 0135000041 | 2009 | PDF | 960 pages | 23,9 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe book provides comprehensive, easy-to-understand introductory coverage of mechanical and electrical systems in buildings. Elementary engineering concepts and step-by-step design principles are introduced in a straightforward manner and supported by over 320 illustrations and 500 photographs. \nIt includes new chapters on emerging sustainability (green) technologies and building science. It presents material that can provide the future architect, architectural engineer, and architectural engineering technician with a basic working-level knowledge of principles and practices. \nThis book is written specifically for those interested in building heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing and piping (water supply and sanitary drainage), storm drainage, illumination, electrical power distribution, building telecommunications, acoustics and acoustical control, vertical/horizontal transportation and conveying, fire protection and suppression, and building renewable energy and energy conservation systems.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/df81/1a132905b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/df81/1a132905b.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa22797a3850a62a7f90df81edc11755a49a94a2","amp;dn":"Mechanical+and+Electrical+Systems+in+Architecture%2C+Engineering+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa22797a3850a62a7f90df81edc11755a49a94a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,34,121,122,56,80,166,42,127,144,223,129,237,193,23,85,164,154,148,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
