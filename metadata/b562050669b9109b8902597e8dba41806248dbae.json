And so he signs up for what he can afford: a mind swap, in which his consciousness is swapped into the body of an alien life-form.Unfortunately, Marvin finds himself in the body of an interstellar criminal - a body that he has to vacate, fast. But that criminal consciousness has stolen Marvin's earthly body. Now Marvin has to find a body on the black market just to stay alive!Travel with Marvin from world to world, each one crazier than the last, as he keeps finding far-from-ideal bodies in awful situations.\n\n\nRead by Tom Weiner\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: Variable\nUnabridged\n\nDate: 2010\nProvider: Blackstone Audio, Inc.\nAudible Enhanced Audio (Ripped with inAudible)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b562050669b9109b8902597e8dba41806248dbae","amp;dn":"Robert+Sheckley+-+Mindswap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b562050669b9109b8902597e8dba41806248dbae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,98,5,6,105,185,16,155,137,2,89,126,141,186,65,128,98,72,219,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
