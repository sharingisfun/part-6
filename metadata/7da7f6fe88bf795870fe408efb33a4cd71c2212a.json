A world where you are free to take the very shots you want without limits or constraints, a world where, at last, your panoramas look like what you want them to!\nWelcome to the Autopano Pro revolution. \n\nAutopano Pro\nFeatures\n1. Automatic picture retrieval\n\nRight-click on a folder : Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« detect panorama Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nAutopano Pro automatically retrieves from a folder the pictures that form part of a panorama and disregards those images that are not needed. No longer any need trawl through your pictures to prepare the panorama!\nAnd the detectivity of Autopano Pro&amp;#039;s engine is really awesome, far better than the human eye. That is why it can solve cases that you would hardly be able to define manually. There is no problem even if the pictures have very different focal lengths or exposures. Even if one picture is clear and the other out of focus, Autopano Pro is able to match them up.\n2. Color correction\n\nIt&amp;#039;s revolutionary! Autopano Pro is the only software of panoramic photography that irons out color and exposure differences and produces invisible seams between adjacent pictures. The user benefit is enormous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the tool allows you absolute freedom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ automatic exposure, automatic white balance, no problem!\nWhat is more, the technology can increase the total panorama dynamic range - with two JPEG images, this by far exceeds a RAW dynamic range. \n. Smartblend ghost-remover\n\nWhile you are taking photographs for a panorama, the scene can change between two takes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ people and vehicles move etc.\nIn the past, tedious photoshop retouching was necessary to make up for these differences. But now, with Smartblend technology, you don&amp;#039;t have to worry, the overlap between two pictures is analyzed to find the best possible transition area.\n4. Fisheye lens\n\nIf you use a fisheye lens, you don&amp;#039;t have to take as many shots to obtain a full 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° by 180Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° panorama. This is a real advantage if you want to produce virtual visits, for example.\nOur solutions can deal with all fisheye types ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ full-frame, circular fisheye on reflex camera, or digital camera fisheye accessories. Results are obtained in the same way, and just as simply as with a standard lens.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da7f6fe88bf795870fe408efb33a4cd71c2212a","amp;dn":"Autopano.Pro.v1.4.2.with+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da7f6fe88bf795870fe408efb33a4cd71c2212a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,167,246,254,136,191,121,88,112,254,64,142,251,51,164,205,113,194,33,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
