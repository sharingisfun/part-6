The opacity of on-screen controls can also be adjusted from the Config Menu.\r\nTwo new features to make play easier and more convenient!\r\nAndroid edition also includes an option to turn enemy encounters off on the world and area maps (will not skip event battles) and a Max Stats command to become all-powerful in the blink of an eye.\r\nMajor game controls\r\nMovement: Virtual joypad (Select between analogue and digital modes)\r\nMenu navigation: Fixed digital buttons\r\nConfirm: A button\r\nCancel: B button\r\nOpen menu: Y button\r\nAs this application is very large, it will take some time to download.\r\nThis application takes up around 2GB of memory. Over 4GB of free space is required to download it, so make sure that ample spare memory is available before attempting to do so.\r\n\r\n[Read before playing]\r\nDepending on the terrain and timing of the action, the buggy, submarines, airships, and other modes of transportation may cease to move when the player embarks or disembarks. Currently, the only fix is to restart the game from a data file saved before the bug occurred. We recommend saving frequently and/or utilizing multiple save files. This bug occurs most often when players embark or disembark while extremely close to the terrain, as well as during time-sensitive activities for events.\r\nPlease note that the game will not save automatically when escaping from a battle on the world map, even if the Auto Save function is set to the ON setting.\r\n\r\n[Applicable devices]\r\nCheck the URL below to see which devices are optimal for gameplay.
