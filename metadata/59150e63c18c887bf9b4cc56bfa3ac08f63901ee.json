Sohn's classic book, Mountain Country Cooking, was a James Beard Award nominee in 1997. In Appalachian Home Cooking, Sohn expands and improves upon his earlier work by using his extensive knowledge of cooking to uncover the romantic secrets of Appalachian food, both within and beyond the kitchen. Shedding new light on Appalachia's food, history, and culture, Sohn offers over eighty classic recipes, as well as photographs, poetry, mail-order sources, information on Appalachian food festivals, a glossary of Appalachian and cooking terms, menus for holidays and seasons, and lists of the top Appalachian foods. Appalachian Home Cooking celebrates mountain food at its best.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59150e63c18c887bf9b4cc56bfa3ac08f63901ee","amp;dn":"Appalachian+Home+Cooking%3A+History%2C+Culture%2C+and+Recipes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59150e63c18c887bf9b4cc56bfa3ac08f63901ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,21,14,99,193,140,136,123,249,180,204,86,191,163,172,8,246,57,1,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
