The band's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums, percussion), and Tony Fredianelli (guitar, vocals). Leo Kremer, a recent Berkeley graduate, had been filling in for original bassist Arion Salazar, but he will not take part in any recordings with the band.\n\nAfter the massive success of their eponymous debut album in 1997, the band released one more album, 1999's Blue, before guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released under circumstances that still elicit controversy. More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. It is reported on the band's Facebook page that he is able to return whenever he wishes; that there is an &quot;open door policy&quot; for him.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf Titled \n\n\n\nThird Eye Blind is the eponymous band's fourteen-track debut album. The album, released on April 8, 1997, includes the top 5 hits &quot;Semi-Charmed Life,&quot; and &quot;Jumper, as well as the top 10 hit &quot;How's It Going to Be.&quot; It has since gone on to sell well over six million copies.[1]\n\nThe first US issue of Third Eye Blind, approximately 500,000 copies, featured a gold-tinted cover photograph with a dark red band logo. The photo was then changed to red with a yellow logo (seen above) at the band's request. UK and other Continental European nations continued offering the gold edition, and Japan had a cyan, negative photo cover.[2]\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Losing a Whole Year&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n2.\t&quot;Narcolepsy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \n3.\t&quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot; (Jenkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29 \n4.\t&quot;Jumper&quot; (Jenkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n5.\t&quot;Graduate&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10 \n6.\t&quot;How's It Going to Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14 \n7.\t&quot;Thanks a Lot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n8.\t&quot;Burning Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00 \n9.\t&quot;Good for You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \n10.\t&quot;London&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07 \n11.\t&quot;I Want You&quot; (Jenkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29 \n12.\t&quot;The Background&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57 \n13.\t&quot;Motorcycle Drive By&quot; (Jenkins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23 \n14.\t&quot;God of Wine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue \n\n\nBlue is the second album by Third Eye Blind, written and recorded in 1999 and released on November 23, 1999. It is a moodier, darker album than the band's first, though the second single was the radio-friendly &quot;Never Let You Go&quot;. The album debuted at #40 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling about 75,000 copies in its first week of release.[1] Blue has been certified platinum by the RIAA, selling about 1.25 million copies in the U.S.[1][2]\n\nDuring the band's tour shortly after the release of Blue, Kevin Cadogan was &quot;released&quot; from the band (allegedly following a vote by the band's other members). Tony Fredianelli, who had some limited experience with the band previously, joined the band shortly thereafter. Cadogan subsequently sued Third Eye Blind for breach of contract, with a settlement of an undisclosed amount permanently ending the relationship\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Anything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59 \n2.\t&quot;Wounded&quot; (Jenkins, Kevin Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51 \n3.\t&quot;10 Days Late&quot; (Jenkins, Arion Salazar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05 \n4.\t&quot;Never Let You Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 \n5.\t&quot;Deep Inside of You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10 \n6.\t&quot;1000 Julys&quot; (Jenkins, Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n7.\t&quot;An Ode to Maybe&quot; (Jenkins, Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36 \n8.\t&quot;The Red Summer Sun&quot; (Jenkins, Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25 \n9.\t&quot;Camouflage&quot; (Jenkins, Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n10.\t&quot;Farther&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01 \n11.\t&quot;Slow Motion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07 \n12.\t&quot;Darkness&quot; (Jenkins, Cadogan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47 \n13.\t&quot;Darwin&quot; (Jenkins, Salazar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:32\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194461bb3793c9d9bb4ba8453414bcafa5952a5a","amp;dn":"Third+Eye+Blind+%282+albums%29+-+Self+Titled+%26+Blue+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194461bb3793c9d9bb4ba8453414bcafa5952a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,68,97,187,55,147,201,217,187,75,168,69,52,20,188,175,165,149,42,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
