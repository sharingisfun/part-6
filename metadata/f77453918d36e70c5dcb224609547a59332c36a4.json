Cameron HawleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel, Executive Suite, was good reading, and Ernest Lehman has fashioned it into screen form as a dramatically interesting motion picture humanizing big business and its upper echelon personalities.\n\nEight scene-stealers vie for the star billing and each is fine, with some standing out over what amounts to standout performances by all concerned in the drama. Certainly Fredric MarchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characterization of the controller will be remembered among the really sock delineations. So will William HoldenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portrayal of the idealistic, but practical, young executive.\nAlso effective as the other stars are Louis Calhern, cynical stockbroker who tries to turn misfortune to personal gain; Barbara Stanwyck, neurotic heiress; Walter Pidgeon, an executive never able to rise above a number two position; Paul Douglas, the hearty sales executive; June Allyson, HoldenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife and Shelley Winters, DouglasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secretary and after-hour amour.\nThe drama is built on the efforts of the several vice-presidents to take over the top position, with most of the conflict in the film version centers on March, as he tries to seize power.\n\nAll star cast.\nRiveting drama set in the world of big business where five executives battle for the post of President of a prosperous furniture company when the previous boss suddenly dies.\n\nRobert Wise's Executive Suite, based on Cameron Hawley's early 1950s novel of corporate politics and power-plays, has scarcely dated at all across six decades -- a survivor of corporate America, Hawley knew whereof he wrote, and screenwriter Ernest Lehman understood drama in a manner that few of his peers could match. The players are uniformly excellent, with Paul Douglas perhaps outclassed just a slight bit by the others on matters of subtlety; but between all of the performances from the top down -- even June Allyson in one of her best wifely portrayals -- the movie is completely engrossing on a dramatic level, with the story drawing the viewer in ever more intensely. The levels of suspense get ratcheted up in a manner of which even Hitchcock might have approved, from the Friday afternoon death of an &quot;unidentified&quot; man to the close-quarter personal and philosophical clashes that ensue in the boardroom -- but not without some telling vignettes along the way, including a restaurant scene involving Louis Calhern at the Stork Club that anticipates Lehman's work in The Sweet Smell Of Success three years later.\n \nTHIS ONE HAS TWO AUDIO TRACKS NO TWO IS THE ONE WITH THE COMMENTARY.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 905mb\nDuration.... 01:44:24\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 961kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 244kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77453918d36e70c5dcb224609547a59332c36a4","amp;dn":"Executive+Suite+1954+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77453918d36e70c5dcb224609547a59332c36a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,116,83,145,141,54,231,12,93,203,34,70,9,84,122,89,51,44,54,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
