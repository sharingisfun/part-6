Harrison became interested in the Hare Krishna movement in the mid-1960s, and over time became an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles and to their Western audience. Following the band's break-up in 1970, he enjoyed a successful solo career, and in 1988 co-founded the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, with Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Harrison number 11 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n\nAlthough John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote most of the songs, Beatles albums generally included at least one Harrison composition. His later songs with the Beatles include &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. By 1970, Harrison had accumulated a backlog of compositions, which he recorded and released as the triple album All Things Must Pass, from which two hit singles originated: a double A-side single, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;/&quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, and &quot;What Is Life&quot;. Later, he wrote two hit singles for former Beatle Ringo Starr, as well as songs for the Traveling Wilburys. With Ravi Shankar, Harrison organized the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, widely regarded as the first significant benefit concert. Among his many accomplishments, Harrison also worked as a session musician and as a record and film producer, co-founding the production company HandMade Films in 1978.\n\nHarrison married twice, first to model Pattie Boyd from 1966 to 1977, and from 1978 until his death to record company secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias, with whom he had one son, Dhani Harrison. He was a close friend of Eric Clapton, and is the only Beatle to have published an autobiographyÃ¢â‚¬â€I, Me, Mine (1980). Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. \n\n\nEarly Takes Vol. 1 2012\n\n\nEarly Takes: Volume 1 is a compilation album of tracks recorded by George Harrison, released on 1 May 2012. The tracks were featured in and originally released as part of the deluxe version of Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary film George Harrison: Living in the Material World.\n\n\nEarly Takes was released on 1 May 2012 by UMe on CD, LP and as a download.[9] In October 2011, the album had been issued as part of a deluxe edition Blu-ray, DVD and CD release of the documentary in the United Kingdom.[10]\n\nThe album debuted at number 66 in the UK[11] and number 20 on the US Billboard 200,[12] with sales of 18,000 copies, giving Harrison his highest placement on the Billboard 200 since his posthumous studio album Brainwashed debuted at number 18 in 2002. In other US charts the album also reached number 3 (Top Soundtracks), number 7 (Top Rock Albums) and number 17 (Top Digital Albums).[13] It also debuted at number 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart.[14]\n\nDavid Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote that the album deserved a &quot;brass-band welcome&quot; and concluded: &quot;This set's subtitle suggests there are more rarities to come; based on the quality here, I propose a fullÃ¢â‚¬â€œblown Anthology.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;My Sweet Lord (Demo)&quot; \n\n2.\t&quot;Run of the Mill (Demo)&quot; \n\n3.\t&quot;I'd Have You Anytime (Early Take)&quot; \n\n4.\t&quot;Mama You've Been on My Mind (Demo)&quot; \n\n5.\t&quot;Let It Be Me (Demo)&quot; \n\n6.\t&quot;Woman Don't You Cry for Me (Early Take)&quot; \n\n7.\t&quot;Awaiting on You All (Early Take)&quot; \n\n8.\t&quot;Behind That Locked Door (Demo)&quot; \n\n9.\t&quot;All Things Must Pass (Demo)&quot; \n\n10.\t&quot;The Light That Has Lighted the World (Demo)&quot; \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2117e792f55114f123d0d72aeba938b792431171","amp;dn":"George+Harrison+-+Early+Takes+Vol.+1+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2117e792f55114f123d0d72aeba938b792431171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,23,231,146,245,81,20,241,35,208,215,42,235,169,56,183,146,67,17,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
