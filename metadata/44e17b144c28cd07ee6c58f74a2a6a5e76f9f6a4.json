Once you enter the underworld you have to deal with all the consequences - you are not the only one out there looking for decent loot. Hide in the shadows of the dark, savage city. Sneak into old ruins, haunted cathedrals and mansions of the rich. Incapacitate your enemies quietly or in an open fight. This unique sneak-em-up game provides you with a range of means to achieve your goal. Remember though - secrecy is your best friend.\n\nTHIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ GOLD is a first-person perspective stealth game. It was the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ different surfaces cause varying noise (for example carpets are quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud). You can use sound to your advantage - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, THIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ GOLD can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\nMoto Racer 1, 2\nLegends of Grimrock\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e17b144c28cd07ee6c58f74a2a6a5e76f9f6a4","amp;dn":"Thief+Gold+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e17b144c28cd07ee6c58f74a2a6a5e76f9f6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,225,123,20,76,40,205,7,238,108,88,247,74,42,106,94,118,249,246,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
