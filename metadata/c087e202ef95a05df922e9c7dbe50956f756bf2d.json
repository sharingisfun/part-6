From capture to output, PhotoKit Sharpener 2.0 intelligently produces the optimum sharpness on any image, from any source, reproduced on any output device. But PhotoKit Sharpener 2.0 also provides the creative controls to address the requirements of individual images and the individual tastes of users.\n\nPhotoKit Sharpener new features highlights:\n - The new dialog window in PhotoKit SHARPENER 2.01 now includes a preview button that allows seeing a preview of the selected sharpening effect. The preview will only be accurate when the preview window is zoomed into 100%.\n - The cursor inside of the preview window shows the area of the image that will be zoomed in when you click the mouse.\n - New to PhotoKit SHARPENER 2.0 (but previously available in PhotoKit Color 2) is the ability to have effects with multiple layers and layer groups returned as a single pixel layer. This feature can help keep file sizes down although it it does eliminate the flexibility of individual layer adjustments after an effect has been applied.\n - The Create Layer Mask options allow all PhotoKit SHARPENER 2.01 effects to be brushed in or out depending on the Hide or Show effect options.\n - The Show Batch Options allow stacking multiple effects to be run one after the other. So if you have a common capture, creative and output sharpening series you use, you can add those effects to a batch list. The batch list can be saved and loaded.\n\nInfo: \n- Install\n- Copy Crack to the install dir.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/63267870417635611380.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/63267870417635611380.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c087e202ef95a05df922e9c7dbe50956f756bf2d","amp;dn":"PhotoKit+Sharpener+2.0.7+%28x32%2Fx64%29+%5BENG%5D+%5BCrack%5D+%5BPhotoshop+Plug","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c087e202ef95a05df922e9c7dbe50956f756bf2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,135,226,2,239,149,160,93,249,34,233,199,219,229,9,86,247,86,191,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
