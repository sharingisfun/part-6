This book will show you how to write robust multithreaded applications in C++ while avoiding many common pitfalls.\n\n\nAbout the Technology\nMultiple processors with multiple cores are the norm these days. The C++11 version of the C++ language offers beefed-up support for multithreaded applications, and requires that you master the principles, techniques, and new language features of concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nAbout the Book\nWithout assuming you have a background in the subject, CC++ Concurrency in Action gradually enables you to write robust and elegant multithreaded applications in C++11. You'll explore the threading memory model, the new multithreading support library, and basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. Along the way, you'll learn how to navigate the trickier bits of programming for concurrency.\nWritten for C++ programmers who are new to concurrency and others who may have written multithreaded code using other languages, APIs, or platforms.\n\nWhat's Inside\n\nWritten for the new C++11 Standard\nProgramming for multiple cores and processors\nSmall examples for learning, big examples for practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a773294e7d86363ba8825620ce5b88cfd89f3f8","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+Concurrency+in+Action%3A+Practical+Multithreading","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a773294e7d86363ba8825620ce5b88cfd89f3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,119,50,148,231,216,99,99,186,136,37,98,12,229,184,140,253,137,243,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
