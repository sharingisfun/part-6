But the fight was fixed and notes upon the dark chapter in boxing history, when the mafia controlled who fought who and who would win. La Motta, a 3-1 favourite was ordered to throw the fight, and later before a congressional hearing would admit so, naming names. And while la Motta never regained the title, one thing has remained with him throughout his life. The fact, that Robinson never knocked him out, &quot;You never got me down.&quot;\n\nOne of the greatest films ever made, Scorseses &quot;Raging Bull&quot; tells the story of the rise and fall of Jake la Motta. Completely uncompromising and emotionally painful to watch, Scorsese was fascinated by the self-destructive nature of la Motta and depicts him as a fighter, forced to sell his soul in order to become a champion and his fall as a human being, then losing everything, even his own humanity, clinging to the one fact, that he never &quot;lost&quot; a fight, brilliantly exemplified thru the final scene, where la Motta sits in front of a mirror, quoting Shakespeare and Brando from &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;I could have been a contender.&quot;\n\nEverything in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; notes upon personal best, especially Robert de Niro, who went thru a personal hell, transforming himself, first to a buff middleweight boxer, then gaining 90 lbs to portrait the fallen la Motta.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL DATA:\n\nFile Size: 8144 MB\nRuntime: 02h 09m 04s\nVideo Codec: X264\nAverage Quantizer: 21.639\nContainer: Matroska (.mkv)\nVideo Bitrate: 6515 Kbps\nResolution: 1916 x 1040\nFPS (Frames/sec): 23.976\nQF (Frame quality): 0.136\n\nAudio Codec: DTS 768 kbps 5.1 chnls (English, Italian)\n                      Aac 256 kbps 5.1 chnls (French, German, Spanish)\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2351/bull1n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2351/bull1n.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/4403/bull2q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/4403/bull2q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/img87/6782/bull3o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/img87/6782/bull3o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/1804/bull4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/1804/bull4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4363/bull5j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4363/bull5j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/3769/bull6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/3769/bull6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4810/bull7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4810/bull7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/3100/bull8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/3100/bull8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/8199/bull9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/8199/bull9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/342/bull10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/342/bull10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/9955/bull11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/9955/bull11.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83052bd77d3798696754f337fe853dd297ab752c","amp;dn":"Raging+Bull+%28BDrip+1080p+ENG-ITA-FRA-GER-SPA%29+Multisub+x264+blur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83052bd77d3798696754f337fe853dd297ab752c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,5,43,215,125,55,152,105,103,84,243,55,254,133,61,210,151,171,117,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
