Cannellini. Fava. Calypso. Edamame. Adzuki. It's true: beans have the coolest names ever. But besides that, they are also one of nature's most perfect foods. Packed with protein, nutrients, and flavor, you might even call them a vegan's #1 best friend (don't worry, we won't tell the trail mix, veggies, or French fries!).\n\nKathy Hester lives in Durham, NC with her 2 cats who would rather not live together, a cute dog with a belly rub addiction, her very own picky eater, a kitchen garden, and more slow cookers than one person should own. She writes a vegan slow cooker blog (www.healthyslowcooking.com)and writes a vegan column for Key Ingredient on their blog every Wednesday (http://www.keyingredient.com/blog/bloggers/kathy-hester). When she's not blogging or developing new recipes she teaches classes and writes articles about eating healthier, menu planning and cooking for picky eaters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac252af0422eb15d9e4b2d9fa2e3444ef8f8a13d","amp;dn":"The+Great+Vegan+Bean+Book-Kathy+Hester.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac252af0422eb15d9e4b2d9fa2e3444ef8f8a13d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,37,42,240,66,46,177,93,158,75,45,159,162,227,68,78,248,248,161,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
