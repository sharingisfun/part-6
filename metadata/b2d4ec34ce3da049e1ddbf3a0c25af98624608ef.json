Yet interpreting the findings, understanding the limitations of the models and recognizing the assumptions that underpin them present considerable challenges for all but those with a background in specialized quantitative financial modeling.\n\nThe use of these quantitative risk models was blamed as being one of the major causes of the financial crisis that began in 2007. This report shows how risk models are constructed and why they play such an important role in financial markets. It provides a holistic approach to Risk Model Validation that will enable you, when faced with a specific risk model, to work out a step-by-step guide to asking the right questions in order to judge the validity of the model.\n\nMathematical modelling, implementation, data gathering, processes, reporting and the way senior management Ã¢â‚¬Å“digestsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ all this information will all be covered.\n\nAn essential part of a decision-makerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armoury, Risk Model Validation provides an intensive guide to asking the key questions when integrating the outputs of quantitative modeling into everyday business decisions.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\n\n1 Basics of Quantitative Risk Models\n\nThinking About Risk\n\nElements of Quantitative Risk Models\n\nAn Historical Example\n\nUsage of Statistics in Quantitative Risk Models\n\nSetup of Quantitative Risk Models\n\n2 How Can a Risk Model Fail?\n\nDesign\n\nImplementation\n\nData\n\nProcesses\n\nUse\n\n3 Validation Issues\n\nWhat is Validation?\n\nWhen to Introduce Validation\n\nWho Carries Out the Validation?\n\nHow to Validate Quantitative Risk Models\n\n4 The Basel Accords and Risk Model Validation\n\nThe Pillars of the Basel Framework\n\nRisk Models and their Validation Under Pillar 1\n\nRisk Models and their Validation Under Pillar 2\n\nStress Testing\n\nGuidance on Validation in Regulatory Documents\n\nFinal Comments\n\n5 Tools for Validation of Model Results\n\nStatistical Methods\n\nBenchmarking\n\nScenario Analysis\n\n6 Other Validation Tools\n\nSoftware Testing\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nStatistical Methods for Validation Of Data\n\nThe Use Test\n\n7 Conclusion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Risk Model Frameworks\n\nThe Modelling and Implementation Framework\n\nThe Validation Framework\n\nUsage of Risk Models\n\nReferences\n\nIndex\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nChristian Meyer is working as Quantitative Analyst in the Portfolio Modeling Team for Market and Credit Risk in the Risk Controlling Unit of DZ BANK AG in Frankfurt where he is responsible for the development of portfolio models for credit risk in the banking book and incremental risk in the trading book.
