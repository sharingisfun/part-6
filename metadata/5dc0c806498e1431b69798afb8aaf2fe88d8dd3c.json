Animation. The name\nis somewhat alliterative and is inspired by Yosemite National Park. He is\ncommonly depicted as an extremely grouchy gunslinging prospector, outlaw,\npirate or cowboy with a hair-trigger temper and an intense hatred of rabbits,\nparticularly Bugs Bunny. Along with Elmer Fudd, he is the de facto archenemy of\nBugs Bunny. In cartoons with non-Western themes, he uses various aliases,\nincluding 'Chilkoot Sam' (named for the Chilkoot Trail; Sam pronounces it\n'Chilli-koot') in 14 Carrot Rabbit (although in the same cartoon, when he tries\nto gain Bugs Bunny's trust, he cleverly invents alias 'Square-deal Sam'),\n'Riff Raff Sam' in Sahara Hare, 'Sam Schulz' in Big House Bunny, 'Seagoin' Sam'\nin Buccaneer Bunny, 'Shanghai Sam' in Mutiny on the Bunny, and 'Sam Von Schamm\nthe Hessian' in Bunker Hill Bunny and many others. During the Golden Age of\nAmerican animation, Yosemite Sam appeared in 33 shorts.\n\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED!!!!\n\n\nMORE TO COME!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dc0c806498e1431b69798afb8aaf2fe88d8dd3c","amp;dn":"Yosemite+Sam+Pack+%281943-2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dc0c806498e1431b69798afb8aaf2fe88d8dd3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,192,200,6,73,142,20,49,182,151,152,175,184,170,242,254,136,216,221,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
