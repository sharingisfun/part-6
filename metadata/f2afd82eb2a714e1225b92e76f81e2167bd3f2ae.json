I am not a big metalhead that I once was just a decade ago back in high school. I really don't care for today's brand of hard rock. A lot of it I find contrived and pure drivel. Most hard rock bands won't last long as AC/DC has, nor will they have a lasting impact that the legendary Aussie band has over rock 'n roll music. I found a used copy of the remastered &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; today. I loved songs like &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Moneytalks&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; back in high school and I still do to this day, so I had to buy this album. &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; may not be &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (another AC/DC album I need to get) or &quot;Back in Black&quot; but it sure as heck a fun album to listen to. I almost forgot how much I loved &quot;Are You Ready&quot; with its sing along chorus from rhythmn guitarist Malcom Young and bassist Cliff Williams. An absolutely infectious hard rock song that just sticks into the listener's head permenantly. &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is without a doubt one of the best songs that showcases Angus Young's undeniable guitar talents and a reminder to young and upcoming guitarists why he is still one of the best hard rock guitarists around. Like &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, &quot;MoneyTalks&quot; is incredibly catchy with its sing-along chorus. I love that song to pieces. That song ranks right up there with &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; as one of the overall best AC/DC tracks around. AC/DC gets a lot of flack for sounding the same on each record but I see the band staying true to their bluesy hard rock sound and consistently putting out great rock and roll albums. So what if each album sounds alike? AC/DC has been around for two, three decades now and has managed to remain relevant and maintain a successful career to this very day. I seriously doubt that in 20-30 years we are going to remember bands like Linkin Park and Cold. AC/DC forever! \n\nby Erica Anderson\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Thunderstruck.wma                                 \n02 - Fire Your Guns.wma                                \n03 - Moneytalks.wma                                    \n04 - The Razors Edge.wma                               \n05 - Mistress For Christmas.wma                        \n06 - Rock Your Heart Out.wma                           \n07 - Are You Ready.wma                                 \n08 - Got You By The Balls.wma                          \n09 - Shot Of Love.wma                                  \n10 - Let's Make It.wma                                 \n11 - Goodbye And Good Riddance To Bad Luck.wma         \n12 - If You Dare.wma   \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2afd82eb2a714e1225b92e76f81e2167bd3f2ae","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+The+Razor%5C%27s+Edge+%281990%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2afd82eb2a714e1225b92e76f81e2167bd3f2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,175,216,46,178,167,20,225,34,91,146,231,111,129,226,22,123,211,242,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
