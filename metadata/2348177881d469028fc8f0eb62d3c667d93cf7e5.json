Based on his own story and script, Djibril Diop MambÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ty made Touki Bouki with a budget of $30,000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½obtained in part from the Senegalese government. Though influenced by French New Wave, Touki Bouki displays a style all its own. Its camerawork and soundtrack have a frenetic rhythm uncharacteristic of most African filmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½known for their often deliberately slow-paced, linearly evolving narratives. Through jump cuts, colliding montage, dissonant sonic accompaniment, and the juxtaposition of premodern, pastoral and modern sounds and visual elements, Touki Bouki conveys and grapples with the hybridization of Senegal. A pair of lovers, Mory and Anta, fantasize about fleeing Dakar for a mythic and romanticized France. The film follows them as they try to scavenge and hustle the funds for their escape. They both make it to the steamliner that would transport them to Paris, but before it disembarks, Mory is drawn back to Dakar and cannot succumb to the seduction of the West. Touki Bouki won the Special Jury Award at the Moscow film Festival and the International Critics Award at Cannes.\n\nCAST\nMagaye Niang - Mareme Niang - Aminata Fall - Ousseynou Diop - Josephine Baker - Christoph Colomb - Ndou Labia - Mustapha Ture\n\nSUBTITLES\nenglish\nportuguese\n\nFile Name .........................................: Touki Bouki.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,309,517,824 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:25:35\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1838 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.250 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2348177881d469028fc8f0eb62d3c667d93cf7e5","amp;dn":"Touki+Bouki+aka+Journey+of+the+Hyena+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2348177881d469028fc8f0eb62d3c667d93cf7e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,72,23,120,129,212,105,2,143,200,240,235,98,211,198,103,217,60,247,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
