I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs The New York Knicks:\n\nReggie Miller single-handedly crushed the hearts of Knick fans multiple times. But it was the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals that solidified Miller as Public Enemy #1 in New York City. With moments to go in Game 1, and facing a seemingly insurmountable deficit of 105-99, Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to give his Indiana Pacers an astonishing victory. This career-defining performance, combined with his give-and-take with Knicks fan Spike Lee, made Miller and the Knicks a highlight of the 1995 NBA playoffs. Peabody Award-winning director Dan Klores will explore how Miller proudly built his legend as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe GardenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest VillainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4a62bc080c54266cde3c7b6a9f8f26b306e45d","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+Winning+Time%3A+Reggie+Miller+vs+New+York+Knicks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df4a62bc080c54266cde3c7b6a9f8f26b306e45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,74,98,188,8,12,84,38,108,222,60,123,106,159,143,38,179,6,228,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
