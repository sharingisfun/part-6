It is widely accepted as the best single authoritative book on electronic circuit design. In addition to new or enhanced coverage of many topics, the third edition includes 90 oscilloscope screenshots illustrating the behavior of working circuits, dozens of graphs giving highly useful measured data of the sort that is often buried or omitted in datasheets but which you need when designing circuits, and 80 tables (listing some 1650 active components), enabling intelligent choice of circuit components by listing essential characteristics (both specified and measured) of available parts. The new Art of Electronics retains the feeling of informality and easy access that helped make the earlier editions so successful and popular. It is an indispensable reference and the gold standard for anyone, student or researcher, professional or amateur, who works with electronic circuits.\r\n\r\n   - Over 450,000 copies sold of first and second editions\r\n   - The leading practical guide to circuit design\r\n   - Fully up to date and packed with valuable advice\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n\r\n1.

He was one of the pioneers of the search for intelligent life beyond the Earth, and one of the leaders behind SETI. Other research interests include observational astrophysics, x-ray and particle microscopy, and optical interferometry. He is the author of some 200 scientific articles and reports, has consulted widely for industry and government, and is the designer of numerous electronic and photographic instruments.\r\n\r\nWinfield Hill, Rowland Institute of Science, Harvard University, Massachusetts\r\n\r\nWinfield Hill has held positions at numerous organisations, including Harvard University's Electronic Design Center and Sea Data Corporation. Currently he is the Director of Electronics Engineering at the Rowland Institute for Science where he has designed some 250 electronic instruments. Recent interests include high-voltage RF (to 15kV) and precision high-current electronics (to 6000A).\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nHardcover: 1219 pages\r\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 3 edition (April 9, 2015)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0521809266\r\nISBN-13: 978-0521809269\r\n \nhttp://artofelectronics.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b156a04eb3a124e17972502564cc8d099112e9dc","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Electronics+%283rd+Edition%29%2C+by+Horowitz+%26amp%3B+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b156a04eb3a124e17972502564cc8d099112e9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,86,160,78,179,161,36,225,121,114,80,37,100,204,141,9,145,18,233,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
