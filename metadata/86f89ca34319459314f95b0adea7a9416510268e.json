Written in November-December 1931, the story was first published in April 1936; this was the only fiction of Lovecraft's published during his lifetime that did not appear in a periodical.\n\nThe story describes a young man's discovery of a strange hybrid race, half-human and half an unknown creature that resembles a cross between a fish and a frog, that dwell in Innsmouth - a coastal town that had seen better days, and the waters offshore. The townspeople worship Dagon, a Philistine deity incorporated into the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\n(Taken from Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Over_Innsmouth)\n\nThis is an Original Production for BBC Radio 4Extra\n\nRead by Richard Coyle.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f89ca34319459314f95b0adea7a9416510268e","amp;dn":"H.P.+Lovecraft+-+The+Shadow+Over+Innsmouth++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f89ca34319459314f95b0adea7a9416510268e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,248,156,163,67,25,69,147,20,249,91,10,222,167,169,65,101,16,38,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
