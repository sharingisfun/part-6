There's no money in being an honest trader these days. Smuggling contraband is a risky business, but the rewards are great - especially for those lucky or connected enough to join the exclusive Smugglers Guild.\n\nThe second story, &quot;Thirst For Vengeance&quot;, recalls the pirate raiders that killed your parents and kidnapped your sister when you were a child. As a graduate of the space academy with a ship of your own, the time has finally come to seek your revenge.\n\nIn the final story, &quot;SolomonÃ‚Â´s Treasure&quot;, your father dedicated his life to finding the hidden treasure of Solomon McTavish, legendary pirate, and died without success. Perhaps you can do better - but you are not the only one seeking this vast fortune.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccb85b48fe018fd2a4607af8fa5a26cb4830402","amp;dn":"Smugglers+V+%28Latest+With+1.4B+Patch+%2B++Guild+DLC%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccb85b48fe018fd2a4607af8fa5a26cb4830402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,203,133,180,143,224,24,253,42,70,7,175,143,165,162,108,180,131,4,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
