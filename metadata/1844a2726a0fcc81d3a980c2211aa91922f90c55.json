But there has been a distinct lack of resources to help them until now. The Porn Trap is the first book to take a comprehensive look at porn addiction and other devastating consequences of porn use, addressing the full range of problems that impact everyone from recreational &quot;dabblers&quot; to compulsive addicts, and the people who care about them.\nIn this groundbreaking book, sex and relationship therapists Wendy and Larry Maltz take on this important subject with wisdom, authority, and compassion. They shed new light on the power of pornographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½revealing why it's so easy to develop a serious problem with porn and often hard to break free from its clutches. Without judgment or blame, the Maltzes outline the destructive effects of porn use, and offer a commonsense, practical approach for healing supported by innovative exercises, checklists, and suggestions.\nThe Porn Trap will help you to:\nIdentify and evaluate the impact of porn\nDecide whether it's time to quit using porn\nLearn how to stop using porn and deal with cravings\nRebuild self-esteem and restore personal integrity\nHeal a relationship harmed by porn use, and\nDevelop a thriving and satisfying sexual life without porn\nThroughout the book are powerful real-life stories from everyday people from all walks of life who have struggled with porn and gotten out from under its influence. Their experiences show that no matter how bad things may seem, it is possible to change and eventually triumph over this increasingly common problem.\nWith The Porn Trap, Wendy and Larry Maltz provide a unique blend of help, hope, and healing for all who want to move away from porn, improve their lives, and create genuine intimacy with a partner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1844a2726a0fcc81d3a980c2211aa91922f90c55","amp;dn":"The+Porn+Trap%3A+The+Essential+Guide+to+Overcoming+Problems+Caused","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1844a2726a0fcc81d3a980c2211aa91922f90c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,68,162,114,106,15,204,129,211,169,128,194,33,26,169,25,34,249,12,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
