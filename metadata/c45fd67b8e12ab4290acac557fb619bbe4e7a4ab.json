The album received generally positive critical reviews.[13] Rolling Stone called the album &quot;the summer's most brilliantly demented party record&quot;[14] and Blender hailed the music as &quot;convincingly ferocious&quot;.[15]  Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot;, which reached #10 in the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart and #2 in the UK Singles Chart; &quot;Gay Bar&quot;, which reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart; and &quot;Dance Commander&quot;, which reached #40 in the UK Singles Chart.  Fire went gold in the United Kingdom on September 5, 2003. Later that year, the album was re-released with a bonus DVD containing the music videos for all three singles from the album.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Dance Commander\n[02] Electric Demons In Love\n[03] Naked Pictures (Of Your Mother)\n[04] Danger!
