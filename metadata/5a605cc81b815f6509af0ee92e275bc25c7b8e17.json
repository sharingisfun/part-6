He enjoys his day job as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department . . . but he lives for his nighttime hobby of hunting other killers. Dexter is therefore not pleased to discover that someone is shadowing him, observing him, and copying his methods. Dexter is not one to tolerate displeasure . . . in fact, he has a knack for extricating himself from trouble in his own pleasurable way.\n\nLike the previous five best-selling novels in the Dexter series, Double Dexter showcases the witty, macabre originality that has propelled Jeff Lindsay to international success. Double Dexter is raucously entertaining . . . full of smart suspense and dark laughs.\n\nRead by Jeff Lindsay\n\n--------------------------------\nVisit us for more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a605cc81b815f6509af0ee92e275bc25c7b8e17","amp;dn":"Double+Dexter+by+Jeff+Lindsay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a605cc81b815f6509af0ee92e275bc25c7b8e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,96,92,200,27,129,95,101,9,175,14,233,46,39,91,194,92,123,142,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
