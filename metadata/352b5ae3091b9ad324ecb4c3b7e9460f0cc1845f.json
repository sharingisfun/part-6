He is best known as the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which started life in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a &quot;trilogy&quot; of five books that sold over 15 million copies in his lifetime, a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature film. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.\n\nHe also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), Last Chance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who. A posthumous collection of his work, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.\n\nAdams became known as an advocate for animals and the environment, and a lover of fast cars, cameras, and the Apple Macintosh. He was a staunch atheist, famously imagining a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, &quot;This is an interesting world I find myself inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an interesting hole I find myself inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&quot; The biologist Richard Dawkins dedicated his book, The God Delusion (2006), to Adams, writing on his death that, &quot;[s]cience has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender.\n\nIncluded in this torrent is:\nThe HitchhikerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to the Galaxy full audiobook collection (mp3)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLife, the Universe and Everything (1982) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSo Long, and Thanks For All the Fish (1984)  \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMostly Harmless (1992) \nDirk Gently Detective novels (mp3)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988) \nOther books co-wrote or inspired by AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLast Chance to See (1990, with Mark Carwardine)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDouglas Adams's Starship Titanic (1997), written by Terry Jones (who insists he wrote the whole thing while in the nude), based on an idea by Adams \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Salmon of Doubt (2002), unfinished novel manuscript (11 chapters), short stories, essays, and interviews (read by Simon Jones) \nThe HitchhikerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide feature film:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) (2005) \nAlso, the three-disc collection of titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Douglas Adams at the BBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ narrated by Simon Jones.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352b5ae3091b9ad324ecb4c3b7e9460f0cc1845f","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Douglas+Adams+Torrent+%28Hitchhikers+Guide%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352b5ae3091b9ad324ecb4c3b7e9460f0cc1845f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,43,90,227,9,27,154,211,36,236,180,195,183,233,70,15,12,193,132,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
