The girl with the dragon tattoo:\n\nOnce you start The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, there's no turning back. This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.\n\n\n2. The girl who played with fire:\n\nPart blistering espionage thriller, part riveting police procedural, and part piercing exposÃƒÂ© on social injustice, The Girl Who Played with Fire is a masterful, endlessly satisfying novel. \n\nMikael Blomkvist, crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend, the troubled genius hacker Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of SalanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocence, plunges into an investigation. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past. \n\n3. The girl who kicked the hornet's nest:\n\nLisbeth SalanderÃ¢â‚¬â€the heart of LarssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two previous novelsÃ¢â‚¬â€lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revengeÃ¢â‚¬â€against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.\nOnce upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf30d34f028deb71f27c40e21f4ff636ba52c20","amp;dn":"+The+Girl+with+the+Dragon+Tattoo+Trilogy+%28in+English%29+Stieg+Lars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf30d34f028deb71f27c40e21f4ff636ba52c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,243,13,52,240,40,222,183,31,39,196,14,33,244,255,99,107,165,44,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
