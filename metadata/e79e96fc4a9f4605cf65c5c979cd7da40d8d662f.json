Soul Provider \nwas released in 1989 and became a huge hit, selling four million, \nwinning a Grammy and spawning three hit singles. \n\nTime, Love &amp; Tenderness continued the trend, outclassing its \npredecessor to sell six million copies. In spite of detractors who \ncriticized his derivative style he continued to sell well into 1993.\n\nAll That Matters, which failed to make much impact at all on the charts. \nUndaunted he turned his attention to classical crossover and released My \nSecret Passion, an album of opera and arias which was well received \ncritically and commercially.\n\nthe power ballads for which he would become famous. Soul Provider was \nreleased in 1989 and became a huge hit, selling four million, winning \na Grammy and spawning three hit singles. Time, Love &amp; Tenderness \ncontinued the trend, outclassing its predecessor to sell six million \ncopies. \n_______________________\n\n 1.
