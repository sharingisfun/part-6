Tom Parker captures the personalities of the travelers through individual vocalization and provides smooth, expressive narration. The listener is soon caught up in the adventures of these vivid characters as they struggle to survive. Although this is a rousing adventure, some listeners may experience difficulty visualizing the alien settings. M.A.M.
