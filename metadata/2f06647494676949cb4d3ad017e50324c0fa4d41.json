Unlike Marlowe, Spenser maintains a committed relationship with one woman (Susan Silverman). Although he is an ex-boxer (who likes to remind readers that he once fought the former heavyweight champ Jersey Joe Walcott) and lifts weights to stay in shape, he also is quite well educated, cooks, and lives by a code of honor he and Susan discuss occasionallyÃ¢â‚¬â€though as infrequently as he can manage.\n\nThe Godwulf Manuscript (Spenser, #1) by Robert B.
