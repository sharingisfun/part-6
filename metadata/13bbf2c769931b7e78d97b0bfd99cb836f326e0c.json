The gameplay focuses on storytelling through point nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ click gameplay mixed with interactive comics, and is completed by a professional audio track.\n\nThe five episode season begins with: Episode 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Where the Dead Lie\n\nFeatures\n--------\nMultiple branching storylines driven by the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choices\nInterrogate or be interrogated\nMultiple playable characters\nRun homicide investigations or run from homicide investigations\nBalance between politics, justice and the law\n\n1.
