It is the second book of the Second Foundation trilogy, which was written after Asimov's death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate.\r\n\r\nHari Seldon's life's work is about to come to an end. The science of psychohistory he has developed can be refined no more and the plans for the Foundation - which will steer humanity through the dark centuries ahead - are complete. Then political factions in Trantor accuse him of treason.\r\n\r\nThe novel is the second part of The Second Foundation Trilogy and takes place almost entirely in the same time frame as &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; which is the first part of the novel Foundation. In addition to telling a more expanded version of Hari Seldon's confrontation with the Commission of Public Safety it also interweaves R. Daneel Olivaw's struggle against a sect of robots who oppose his plans for humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Roy Avers\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5d66505295690f5d3c4b4b93f2fa6eec9ffe58","amp;dn":"Greg+Bear+-+Foundation+and+Chaos+%28Second+Foundation+Trilogy+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5d66505295690f5d3c4b4b93f2fa6eec9ffe58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,93,102,80,82,149,105,15,93,60,75,75,147,242,250,110,236,159,254,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
