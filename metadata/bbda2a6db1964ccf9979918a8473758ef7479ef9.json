The result wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what MÃƒÂ¸rckÃ¢â‚¬â€or readersÃ¢â‚¬â€expected, but by the opening of Adler-OlsenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocking, fast-paced follow-up, MÃƒÂ¸rck is satisfied with the notion of picking up long-cold leads. So heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naturally intrigued when a closed case lands on his desk: A brother and sister were brutally murdered two decades earlier, and one of the suspectsÃ¢â‚¬â€part of a group of privileged boarding-school studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€confessed and was convicted.\n\nBut once MÃƒÂ¸rck reopens the files, it becomes clear that all is not what it seems. Looking into the supposedly solved case leads him to Kimmie, a woman living on the streets, stealing to survive. Kimmie has mastered evading the police, but now they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only ones looking for her. Because Kimmie has secrets that certain influential individuals would kill to keep buried . . . as well as one of her own that could turn everything on its head.\n\nEvery bit as pulse-pounding as the book that launched the series, The Absent One delivers further proof that Jussi Adler-Olsen is one of the world's premier thriller writers.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbda2a6db1964ccf9979918a8473758ef7479ef9","amp;dn":"Disgrace+%28The+Absent+One%29+by+Jussi+Adler-Olsen+%28Department+Q+02%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbda2a6db1964ccf9979918a8473758ef7479ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,218,42,109,177,150,76,207,153,121,145,138,132,115,117,142,247,71,158,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
