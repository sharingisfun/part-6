This time around\nthere will be even more action as each hour-long episode focuses on the\nrenovation of one vehicle. Discovery Real Time is also stepping things up a\nnotch and shooting the series in HD for the very first time!\n \n Still armed with 5,000 cash, the used car dealing duo will be searching the\ncountry for the best bargains to be had. Whilst Mike checks out local ads and\ninternet auctions negotiating top deals, Edd will be in the workshop\ntransforming the vehicles with crafty second-hand parts.
