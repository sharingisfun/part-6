Moore said that &quot;if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked ... But these days I don't want Watchmen back. Certainly, I don't want it back under those kinds of terms.&quot; DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded, &quot;DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves.&quot;\n\nFollowing months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel limited series under the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; banner: Rorschach, Minutemen, Dr. Manhattan, Comedian, Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, and Ozymandias. Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Every issue will feature a two-page installment of the backup series &quot;Curse of the Crimson Corsair&quot; that has been inspired by the Tales of the Black Freighter story-within-a-story from the original Watchmen, written by Len Wein and featuring art by original Watchmen colorist John Higgins. The project was planned to conclude with a Before Watchmen: Epilogue one-shot, but it was never written. Gibbons stated, &quot;The original series of Watchmen is the complete story that Alan Moore and I wanted to tell. However, I appreciate DC's reasons for this initiative and the wish of the artists and writers involved to pay tribute to our work. May these new additions have the success they desire.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58fa1c830df5a78f7c15638cbf23c8c4b523721d","amp;dn":"Before+Watchmen+%5B%25100+Complete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58fa1c830df5a78f7c15638cbf23c8c4b523721d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,250,28,131,13,245,167,143,124,21,99,140,191,35,200,196,181,35,114,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
