I love it so much, that after my 1st copy got ruined (waterlogged), I ordered it again from Borders, and there were two new copies left they could get.  So yes, I bought TWO MORE new copies of this book, just because I like it so much.\n\nPerfect balance, some easy beginner stuff, but most of it is really intricate and advanced.  Nice and thin too, doesn't bog you down with far too many diagrams... and the price is right, too $5.95 a copy.\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b35b3d3e5abc8005786eefc812cddb327ed7cf","amp;dn":"Origami+Step-by-Step+by+Robert+Harbin.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b35b3d3e5abc8005786eefc812cddb327ed7cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,179,91,61,62,90,188,128,5,120,110,239,200,18,205,219,50,126,215,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
