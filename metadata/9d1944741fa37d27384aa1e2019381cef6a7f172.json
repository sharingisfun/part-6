He certainly does. Updating Chicago blues forms with hilarious, tough lyrics--in fact, all but stealing the meter of Chuck Berry's &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot; for &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;--on one side, dropping some of his most devastating solo acoustic science (&quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,&quot; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;) on the other, the first of Dylan's two 1965 long-players broke it right down with style, substance, and elegance. &lt;p&gt; Note: This is an mp4 encode of the new &quot;reissue&quot; version of Bringing It All Back Home: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically. &lt;/p&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1944741fa37d27384aa1e2019381cef6a7f172","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Bringing+It+All+Back+Home+%28Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1944741fa37d27384aa1e2019381cef6a7f172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,25,68,116,31,163,125,39,56,74,161,226,1,147,129,206,246,167,241,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
