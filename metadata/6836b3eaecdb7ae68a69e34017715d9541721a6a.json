Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being \nDave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.\n\n\nIn Utero is the third and final studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993\non DGC Records. Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous \nalbum, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to \nrecord In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The \nmusic was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated \nmedical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's \nnewfound fame.\n\n   1.
