The timing of this upload coincides with the end of another operation by the Israeli army against the Palestinians in Gaza. The operation, called Pillar of Defense, was conducted in the period 14-21 Nov. 2012, and resulted in the killing of over 160 Palestinians, 91 of which were civilians, more than 30 children, and over 1200 injured. \n\nIt may seem odd and inappropriate to discuss the plight of the Palestinians when the theme of the upload is about sins of colonialism in the Americas. But a closer look shows that we are dealing with the same type of crimes. In the Americas, the Western colonialist systematically exterminated the native people and replaced them with European immigrants, a crime that resulted in the death of more than 100 million native people over a period of 400 years.\n\nThe same crime is being committed to the Palestinians starting with the British Mandate in 1922, and the subsequent establishment of the State of Israel. The goal is to drive the native Palestinians and replace them with immigrant Jews. Not counting how many were killed over a period of 90 years, We have now 5 million Palestinian refugees who were displaced from their homes, living under occupation or in refugee camps in below poverty conditions, and with the Israeli army having a free hand to arrest or kill them, and destroy their homes, farms, and trees. \n\nWe have 21 titles in this upload:\n\n-  Benson - Early Civilizations in the Americas Almanac, Vol. 1 (2005)\n\n-  Benson - Early Civilizations in the Americas Almanac, Vol. 2 (2005)\n\n-  Benson - Early Civilizations in the Americas Almanac; Biographies and Primary Sources (2005)\n\n-  Brown - Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee; an Indian History of the American West (1970)\n\n-  Carlise &amp; Golson (Eds.) - Native American from Prehistory to First Contact (2007)\n\n-  Chasteen - Americanos; Latin AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Struggle for Independence (2008)\n\n-  Delay - War of a Thousand Deserts (2008)\n\n-  Deloria &amp; Salisbury (Eds.) - A Companion to American Indian History (2002)\n\n-  Garroutte - Real Indians; Identity and the Survival of Native America (2003)\n\n-  Gray - Colonial America; a History in Documents (2003)\n\n-  Ingstad - The Apache Indians; In Search of the Missing Tribe (1945)\n\n-  Langston - The Native American World (2003)\n\n-  Lewis - The Mammoth Book of the West; the Making of the American West (2001)\n\n-  Marshall - A History of the Colonies Planted by the English on the Content of North America (1824)\n\n-  Miller - Forgotten Tribes; Unrecognized Indians and the Federal Acknowledgment Process (2004)\n\n-  Moore - Savage Frontier, Vol. III, 1840-1841; Rangers, Riflemen and Indian Wars in Texas (2007)\n\n-  Newcomb - The Indians of Texas from Prehistoric to Modern Times (2002)\n\n-  Oertel - Bleeding Borders (2009)\n\n-  Parker - Brother's Keeper; the United States, Race, and Empire in the British Caribbean, 1937Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1962 (2008)\n\n-  Powers - The Killing of Crazy Horse (2010)\n\n-  Strong - Captive Selves, Captivating Others; the Politics and Poetics of Colonial American Captivity Narratives (1999)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef644f59202839e67e568167abd13335f1993479","amp;dn":"Sins+of+Colonialism+-+Collection+7+%28..+in+the+Americas2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef644f59202839e67e568167abd13335f1993479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,100,79,89,32,40,57,230,126,86,129,103,171,209,51,53,241,153,52,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
