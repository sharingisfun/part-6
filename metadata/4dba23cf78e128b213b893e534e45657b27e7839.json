It was recorded at Roundhay Park, Leeds on July 25, 1982. The album was released exclusively as a digital download through Google Music on October 16, 2012. The concert was the band's final show of their European Tour 1982 and was also the band's last live performance with band co-founder and pianist Ian Stewart. \n\nThe song list on this collection is nearly identical to that of Hampton Coliseum (Live 1981), another Rolling Stones live album released earlier in 2012 which documents a show from the 1981 U. S. leg of the same tour. This recording includes the song &quot;Angie,&quot; which does not appear on the Hampton Coliseum recording, but misses two songs which appear on the Hampton album: &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Under My Thumb&quot;   \t3:41\n02. \t&quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;   \t4:13\n03. \t&quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot;   \t4:14\n04. \t&quot;Shattered&quot;   \t5:00\n05. \t&quot;Neighbours&quot;   \t4:10\n06. \t&quot;Black Limousine&quot; (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood) \t3:41\n07. \t&quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)&quot; 9:05\n08. \t&quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; (Eddie Cochran, Ned Fairchild) \t1:46\n09. \t&quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;  3:47\n10. \t&quot;Let Me Go&quot;   \t4:25\n11. \t&quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; (Norman Meade, Jimmy Norman) \t3:43\n12. \t&quot;Beast of Burden&quot;   \t8:55\n13. \t&quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;   \t11:04\n14. \t&quot;Band Intros&quot;   \t1:14\n15. \t&quot;Little T&amp;A&quot;   \t3:31\n16. \t&quot;Angie&quot;   \t4:41\n17. \t&quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;   \t9:05\n18. \t&quot;She's So Cold&quot;   \t4:05\n19. \t&quot;Hang Fire&quot;   \t2:47\n20. \t&quot;Miss You&quot;   \t8:30\n21. \t&quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;   \t3:27\n22. \t&quot;Brown Sugar&quot;   \t3:45\n23. \t&quot;Start Me Up&quot;   \t5:28\n24. \t&quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;   \t6:52\n25. \t&quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;   \t7:17\n                                                  Total length:\n\t                                          2:03:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dba23cf78e128b213b893e534e45657b27e7839","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Live+At+Leeds+1982+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dba23cf78e128b213b893e534e45657b27e7839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,186,35,207,120,225,40,178,19,184,147,229,52,228,86,87,178,126,120,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
