This comprehensive resource is the most authoritative guide available to a sustainable lifestyle and living off of the land.\nCarla Emery started writing The Encyclopedia of Country Living in 1969 during the back-to-the-land movement of that time. She continued to add content and refine the information over the years, and the book went from a self-published mimeographed document to a book of 928 pages.\nThis 40th Anniversary Edition reflects the most up-to-date resource information and the most personal version of the book that became Carla Emery's life work. It is the original manual of basic country skills that have proved essential and necessary for people living in the country, the city, and everywhere in between.\nCarla Emery's The Encyclopedia of Country Living contains 1,000,000 words, 2,000+ recipes, and 1,500+ mail-order sources (for everything she tells you how to do, she also tells you where to get the supplies to do it). This book is so basic, so thorough, so reliable, that it deserves a place in every home.\n\nTable of Contents\n1 Oddments\n2 Introduction to Plants\n3 Grasses, Grains &amp; Canes\n4 Garden Vegetables\n5 Herbs &amp; Flavorings\n6 Tree, Vine, Bush &amp; Bramble\n7 Food Preservation\n8 Introduction to Animals\n9 Poultry\n10 Goats, Cows &amp; Home Dairying\n11 Bee, Rabbit, Sheep &amp; Pig\n12 Appendix\n\nAbout the Author\nCarla Emery lived on a farm in Idaho for more than thirty years as a wife, mother of seven, home-schooler, goat-keeper, garden-grower, writer, and country-living instructor. She wrote and self-published the first editions of The Encyclopedia of Country Living during the early 1970s and also ran her &quot;School of Country Living.&quot; Carla sold nearly 90,000 copies of her self-published editions, traveling the country to promote it and appearing on such shows as The Mike Douglas Show, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Phil Donahue Show, and Good Morning America, where she demonstrated country-living skills such as goat-milking, bread-making, and butter-churning. When Sasquatch Books published the 9th Edition of Encyclopedia in 1994, Carla continued to travel the country promoting and selling the book, and teaching the timeless skills of country living. Carla cultivated a large and loyal following across the country. Carla passed away in 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016b9c80bfda6bb3377fb6ec1318dd3a22afeed3","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Country+Living+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016b9c80bfda6bb3377fb6ec1318dd3a22afeed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,107,156,128,191,218,107,179,55,127,182,236,19,24,221,58,34,175,238,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
