However, events take a turn when one of their bunch who long ago outgrew his old gang and took on adult responsibilities is suddenly in their midst again. Reconnecting is not easy. But soon, Eric, Windows, Hutch and Zoe realize that Linus will not live long enough to experience what's been on their minds for ages: The long-awaited theatrical release of Star Wars - Episode I, which is still several months away. Linus once again suggests to his friends what he's been scheming since fifth grade: Breaking into Skywalker Ranch, this time to steal a print of the movie. Crazy, right? But it might be the only way for Linus to see the movie before he dies. So as insane as it sounds, they take Hutch's van and embark on a mission to drive across half the country to the Ranch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f332ffb43fccca181522ee18dc21f695e4caf6","amp;dn":"Fan+Boys+-+CuBe8021","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f332ffb43fccca181522ee18dc21f695e4caf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,243,50,255,180,63,204,202,24,21,34,238,24,220,33,246,149,228,202,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
