Korn began their existence as the Bakersfield, California-based metal band LAPD, which included guitarists James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer and Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy Snuts&quot; Arvizu, and drummer David Silveria. After issuing an LP, in 1993 the members of LAPD crossed paths with Jonathan Davis, a mortuary science student moonlighting as the lead vocalist for the local group Sexart. They soon asked Davis to join the band, and upon his arrival the quintet rechristened itself Korn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tmp3 320 CBR\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\t88697 57728 2\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.It's On\n02.Right Now\n03.Here To Stay\n04.Ball Tongue\n05.Good God\n06.Falling Away From Me\n07.Pretty\n08.Somebody Someone\n09.Helmet In The Bush\n10.Sean Olsen\n11.Thoughtless\n12.Predictable\n13.Word Up!\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Blind\n02.Got The Life\n03.Alive\n04.A.D.I.D.A.S.\n05.Dead Bodies Everywhere\n06.Bottled Up Inside\n07.Trash\n08.Shoots And Ladders\n09.Wicked (Ice Cube Cover)\n10.My Gift To You (Live @ Woodstock '99)\n11.One More Time\n12.Y'all Want A Single\n13.All In The Family\n\nDisc 3\n\n01.Twist\n02.Chi\n03.Did My Time\n04.Freak On A Leash\n05.Another Brick In The Wall (Parts 1 , 2, 3)\n06.Alone I Break\n07.Make Me Bad\n08.Clown\n09.No Place To Hide\n10.Dirty (Live)\n11.Faget\n12.Play Me (Feat.
