The series was produced by Trickfilmstudio and The Pygos Group for Swiss television, and centres on a family of anthropomorphic penguins who live at the South Pole. The main character is the family's son and title character, Pingu. The fifth and sixth series were filmed by British companies HIT Entertainment and Hot Animation.\n\nThe show originally ran for four series (each series made up of multiple seasons) from 28 May 1986 to 9 April 2000 on SF DRS. In 2001, there were 2 Pingu episodes made (one of them being &quot;Pingu &amp; the Doll&quot;) that did not air during the original run. The episodes were run later, in 2000, as part of a Pingu marathon. HIT Entertainment's request for more episodes convinced Pygos to bring back the show in 1998, with two more series. Of note, season 1 (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990) and season 2 (1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994) were run consecutively but took 4 years for each season to complete, while season 3 (1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996) and season 4 (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2000) took 2 and 3 years to complete Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the show was not cancelled in between. To this day, Pingu maintains a cult following, and enjoys occasional re-runs on CBeebies in the United Kingdom. It aired on the BBC from 1995 until 2006.\n\nStoryline:\n\n\nThe program is set in Antarctica and centres around penguin families who live and work in igloos. The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby the Seal.\n\nOne reason for Pingu's international success is its lack of real spoken language: nearly all dialogue is in an invented &quot;penguin language&quot; consisting of babbling, muttering and sporadic loud honking noises. This was initially retroscripted by Carlo Bonomi, who created all the sound effects for the series. This feature allows people of different linguistic backgrounds to be able to follow the story.\n\nCharacters:\n\n\nPingu's family\n\nPingu is the main character of the series, a typically playful, curious little boy penguin. He is strong-willed and prone to occasional tantrums; when he gets excited or angry or wants attention, he makes a loud squawking noise.\n\nPinga is Pingu's younger sister, who first appears in the episode &quot;The New Arrival&quot;. She resembles an emperor penguin chick, as do other very young penguins throughout the show.\n\nMother and Father are Pingu and Pinga's parents; their actual names are not revealed. Father is a postman who smokes a pipe in the early episodes, but quits later. He has a motorized sledge to deliver the mail, sometimes with help from Pingu. Mother is a housewife who spends most of her time cooking and cleaning. Mother sometimes gets help from Pingu and Pinga, and she always gives them a cuddle when they have learned a lesson.\n\nGrandfather is Pingu and Pinga's paternal grandfather, who first appeared in the episode &quot;Music Lessons&quot;. He is an expert accordionist, as he demonstrates to Pingu in that episode, and is also a former professional weight lifter.\n\nPingu's friends\n\nRobby is a grey seal. His name resembles the German word for seal, Robbe. In the first four seasons, he is bluish-grey, but light grey in the last two. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Pingu Goes Fishing&quot;.\n\nPingo is a somewhat foolhardy penguin. He has a long beak that is essentially flat at the bottom but slightly rounded on the top and a head that is wider and taller. He often persuades Pingu to do wild and silly things with him.\n\nPingg is Pingu's other penguin friend. He also has a long beak, but a shorter head than Pingo.\n\nPongi is a penguin who wears glasses and has a short round beak. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;.\n\nPengy is a penguin very similar to Adelie Penguins, first appears in &quot;Pingu and the School Excursion&quot;, in episode &quot;Time of School&quot;, Pingu resembles Pengy\n\nPenge is a green penguin, appears in Pingu At the Wedding Party, he speaks with an accent that seems to be typical of his race.\n\nPunki is a penguin who first appeared in the episode &quot;Pingu Delivers The Mail&quot;. He has a tuft on his head and wears striped trousers. Punki only appears in a handful of episodes.\n\nBajoo is Pingu's other non-penguin friend. HiT Entertainment reveals him as a &quot;strange newcomer&quot; to the Antarctic in the appearance of an abominable snowman. He debuted in 2005, and appeared in the final episode, &quot;Pingu &amp; the Abominable Snowman&quot;. He also appeared in the 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11 music video and &quot;The Pingu Show&quot;.\n\nPingi is Pingu's girlfriend and Pinga's best friend. She has thick, white eyelashes and a somewhat mushed beak. She first appeared in the episode &quot;Pingu's Admirer&quot;. Pinga is sometimes envious of her because of Pingu paying more attention to her.\n\nOther\n\nThe Schoolmaster is Pingu's teacher. He lives in a nearby school and rings the bell when it is time for school to begin or end. He first appeared in the episode &quot;School Time&quot;.\n\nThe Doctor is the neighborhood's doctor. He lives in a nearby igloo clinic and frequently treats Pingu's injuries, as well as aid in the birth of Pinga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb152edcd78fecf24a6db87b1a4e050ce79346e3","amp;dn":"Pingu.S01-S06.Complete.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb152edcd78fecf24a6db87b1a4e050ce79346e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,21,46,220,215,143,236,242,74,109,184,123,26,78,5,12,231,147,70,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
