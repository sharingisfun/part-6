Read this short, 150-page book that is adapted from Expert Oracle Database Architecture to gain a solid and accurate understanding of how locking and concurrency are dealt with by Oracle Database. Also learn how the Oracle Database architecture accommodates user transactions, and how you can write code to mesh with how Oracle Database is designed to operate.\n\nGood transaction design is an important facet of highly-concurrent applications that are run by hundreds, even thousands of users who are all executing transactions at the same time. Transaction design in turn relies upon a good understanding of how the underlying database platform manages of the locking of resources so as to prevent access conflicts and data loss that might otherwise result from concurrent access to data in the database.\n\nOracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed covers in detail the various lock types, and also different locking schemes such as pessimistic and optimistic locking. Then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about transaction isolation and multiversion concurrency, and how the various lock types support Oracle DatabaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transactional features. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn some good tips for transaction design, as well as some bad practices and habits to avoid. Coverage is also given to redo and undo, and their role in concurrency. This is an important book that anyone developing highly-concurrent applications will want to have handy on their shelf.\n\nProduct Description\n\nAbout the Author\nstrongThomas Kyte/strong is vice president of the Core Technologies Group at Oracle Corporation and has been with the company since version 7.0.9 was released in 1993. Kyte, however, has been working with Oracle since version 5.1.5c. At Oracle, Kyte works with the Oracle database, and more specifically, he helps clients who are using the Oracle database and works directly with them specifying and building their systems or rebuilding and tuning them. Prior to working at Oracle, Kyte was a systems integrator who built large-scale, heterogeneous databases and applications for military and government clients.pTom Kyte is the same &quot;Ask Tom&quot; whose column appears in emOracle Magazine/em, where he answers questions about the Oracle database and tools that developers and database administrators struggle with every day.\n\nPublisher: Apress; 2014 edition (14 November 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1484207610\nISBN-13: 978-1484207611\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nAnother great book 23 November 2014\nBy heitor W LourenÃƒÂ§o Jr -\nAs always, another great boof by Thomas. Very deep and easy to understand. I recommend to all who want to know more on locks, latches, mutexes. It's recommended to developers but DBAs do profit a lot from reading it too. I've been a DBA for almost 30 years and worked with Oracle for about 20 since version 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab735e88fcc712ae2a228bdf93191725d2b58fa3","amp;dn":"Oracle+Database+Transactions+and+Locking+Revealed%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab735e88fcc712ae2a228bdf93191725d2b58fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,115,94,136,252,199,18,174,42,34,139,223,147,25,23,37,210,181,143,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
