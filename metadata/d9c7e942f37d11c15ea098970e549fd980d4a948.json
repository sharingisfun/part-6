Dr. Abraham L. Kierszenbaum presents an integrated approach that correlates normal histology with cellular and molecular biology, pathology, and clinical medicine throughout the text. A unique pictorial approach-through illustrative diagrams, photomicrographs, and pathology photographs-paired with bolded words, key clinical terms in red, and clinical boxes and &quot;Essential Concepts&quot; boxes that summarize important facts give you everything you need to prepare for your course exams as well as the USMLE Step 1.\n\nEasily find and cross-reference information through a detailed table of contents that highlights clinical examples in red.\n\nReview material quickly using pedagogical features, such as Essential Concept boxes, bolded words, and key clinical terms marked in red, that emphasize key details and reinforce your learning.\n\nIntegrate cell biology and histology with pathology thanks to vivid descriptive illustrations that compare micrographs with diagrams and pathological images.\n\nApply the latest developments in pathology through updated text and new illustrations that emphasize appropriate correlations.\n\nExpand your understanding of clinical applications with additional clinical case boxes that focus on applying cell and molecular biology to clinical conditions.\n\nEffectively review concepts and reinforce your learning using new Concept Map flow charts that provide a framework to illustrate the integration of cell-tissue-structure-function within a clinical-pathology context.\n\nBuild a stronger base of clinical knowledge through the integration of cell biology, histology, and pathology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c7e942f37d11c15ea098970e549fd980d4a948","amp;dn":"Histology+and+Cell+Biology%2C+3E+%28Pathology%29+%5BEpub%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c7e942f37d11c15ea098970e549fd980d4a948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,199,233,66,243,125,17,193,94,160,152,151,14,84,159,217,128,212,169,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
