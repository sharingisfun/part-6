MAY 08 2014\n\nSo, this showed up on Vimeo last night and will likely be pulled soon (so I uploaded it here!), but here's the deal. In 2012, actor Topher Grace showed an edit he'd done of episodes I-III of Star Wars to a bunch of friends, trimming the 7 hours of prequels down into 85 action-packed minutes of pure story. This edit is longer (2:47) and is &quot;based on the structure conceived by actor Topher Grace&quot;, which you can read about here.\n\nGrace's version of the film(s) centers on Anakin's training and friendship with Obi-Wan, and his relationship with Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Gone are Trade Federation blockades, the Gungan city, the whole PadmÃƒÂ© handmaiden storyline, the explanation of midichlorians, the galactic senate and the boring politics, Anakin's origins (a backstory which never really needed to be seen in the first place), the droid army's attack on Naboo, and Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) appears only briefly for only one line of dialogue, used as a set-up to introduce us to the Queen.\n\nEncoding Stuff:\n\nEncoded using Handbrake\n\nH.264/MP4\n\n636x268 16:9 DVD Quality\n\n48kHz stereo audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f052282d6267e54fa653b21de931395bfac1bb5","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Turn+to+the+Dark+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f052282d6267e54fa653b21de931395bfac1bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,5,34,130,214,38,126,84,250,101,59,33,222,147,19,149,191,172,27,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
