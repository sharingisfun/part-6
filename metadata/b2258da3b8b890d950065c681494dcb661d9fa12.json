The recording and Alexander&amp;#039;s performance are flawless. A veteran Shakespearean actor, Alexander has a voice that is rich and versatile in portraying each of the speakers in this dialogue. His accent also has an air of authority. He makes one suppose that the ancient Greek philosophers went to Oxford. This work is really delightful to hear as one follows the course of Socrates&amp;#039; arguments and the questions thrown at him by the Athenians. The packaging is sturdy, and the enclosed outline is most helpful. Music at the beginning and end of each side does not distract from the performance. A wonderful introduction to Plato.\n\naudio\naudiobook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2258da3b8b890d950065c681494dcb661d9fa12","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Plato+-+The+Republic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2258da3b8b890d950065c681494dcb661d9fa12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,37,141,163,184,184,144,217,80,6,92,104,20,148,220,182,97,217,250,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
