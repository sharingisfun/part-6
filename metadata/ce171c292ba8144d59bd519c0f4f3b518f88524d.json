This book is an introduction to all those involved in the specification, design, manufacture, installation, operation or maintenance of these systems. The book explains: control theory and how to evaluate, select, position and sequence the appropriate type of control; the electrical knowledge needed to understand controls and the use of electrical circuit drawings; the various types of valves and dampers, and their selection, installation and operation; terminology and attributes of sensors, the selection of moisture sensors, pressure, flow, and auxiliary devices; and, self-powered and system-powered controls. It also explains: electric controls, control diagrams and control logic; the components of pneumatic systems and control applications diagrams; wiring conventions, application-specific electronic controllers and how to use them in HVAC applications; the use of written specifications, schedules, and drawings to clearly identify what is to be installed, how it is to be installed, and how it is expected to operate; Direct Digital Controls (DDC) components, their inputs and outputs, and the programming of DDC routines; and, DDC Networks and Protocols; DDC Specification, Installation and Commissioning. After completing this course, you will understand: control theory and how to evaluate, select, position and sequence the appropriate type of control; the electrical knowledge needed to understand controls and the use of electrical circuit drawings; the various types of valves and dampers, and their selection, installation and operation; terminology and attributes of sensors, the selection of moisture sensors, pressure, flow, and auxiliary devices; and, self-powered and system-powered controls Electric controls, control diagrams and control logic.
