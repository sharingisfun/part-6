Hideyoshi Toyotomi is now leader of a united Japan. He resurrects the Genma and a new hero named Soki rises to the challenge. The game is told through various CGI cutscenes spanning 2 DVDs and 17 Stages. Besides Soki, multiple characters can be played (5 in total), all with their different style of fighting. Soki uses swords, Jubei uses blades, and Ohatsu uses projectiles. The gameplay is faster paced and more of a real-time RPG feel. You can now lock on enemies instead of button mashing like the original games. Cooperative puzzles have been added to the series. In addition, a 360-degree camera is now available.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Five new playable characters. \n\n* Two playable characters on screen at one time. \n\n* Switch between characters any time. \n\n* Cool co-op mode. \n\n* Open ended environments with ability to go back and search for additional items. \n\n* &quot;Test of Valor&quot; to obtain new items not found within game environment.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter for both games, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab56d78cee6c9e4fcb81985f9b62e5587493212","amp;dn":"Onimusha+-+Dawn+of+Dreams+%5BNtsc%5D+%5B2-Disc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab56d78cee6c9e4fcb81985f9b62e5587493212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,181,109,120,206,230,201,228,252,184,25,133,249,182,46,85,135,73,50,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
