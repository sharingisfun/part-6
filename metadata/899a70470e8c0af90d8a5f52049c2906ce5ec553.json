In more than 50% of the DNA exonerations nationwide, unvalidated or improper forensic science contributed to the underlying wrongful conviction.\n\nThese problems include forensic techniques that have not been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation (such as hair microscopy, bite mark comparisons, firearm tool mark analysis and shoe print comparisons); testing that is improperly conducted or analysis that is not accurate (regardless of whether the forensic technique involved is validated); and forensic misconduct (such as fabricated test results and misleading testimony).\n\nForensic Fraud is written by a forensic scientist for the forensic science community, rather than by legal scholars or practitioners, as has been the trend.\n\nResponds directly to the dramatic increase in forensic fraud related laboratory scandals and closures that have plagued the forensic science community\nOffers realistic recommendations and reforms\nIdeally suited for forensic science professionals, legal practitioners, laboratory supervisors, forensic science students and academicians\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 296 pages\nPublisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (May 31, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0124080731\nISBN-13: 978-0124080737\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899a70470e8c0af90d8a5f52049c2906ce5ec553","amp;dn":"Forensic+Fraud%3A+Evaluating+Law+Enforcement+and+Forensic+Science+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899a70470e8c0af90d8a5f52049c2906ce5ec553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,154,112,71,14,140,10,249,13,138,95,82,4,156,41,6,206,94,197,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
