Even though it was an experimental concept album -- toying with unusual time signatures -- it's a comfortable, comforting record, best remembered for the hit song &quot;Take Five,&quot; but also packed with other melodic delights such as &quot;Three To Get Ready&quot; and &quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk,&quot; all of which show the brilliant interplay of Brubeck and saxophonist-composer Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello.  ~ Joe Sixpack\n\nDave Brubeck Quartet - Time Out (50th Anniversary) CD 1 of 2 \n01  Blue Rondo a La Turk \n02  Strange Meadow Lark \n03  Take Five \n04  Three to Get Ready \n05  Kathy's Waltz \n06  Everybody's Jumpin' \n07  Pick Up Sticks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10a72f89dfe350b11abc649328c1d0c0793d8eb8","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+Quartet+-+Time+Out+%2850th+Anniversary%29+CD+1+of+2+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10a72f89dfe350b11abc649328c1d0c0793d8eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,167,47,137,223,227,80,177,26,188,100,147,40,193,208,192,121,61,142,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
