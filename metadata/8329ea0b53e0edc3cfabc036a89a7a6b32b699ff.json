By the mid-'90s, the group's mass popularity had subsided due to professional setbacks and perceived changes in taste. But they continued to tour regularly well into the 21st century.\n\nCinderella was founded in Philadelphia, PA, in 1983 by singer/songwriter/guitarist/keyboardist Tom Keifer (born January 26, 1961) and bassist Eric Brittingham (born May 8, 1960), who quickly added lead guitarist Jeff LaBar (born March 18, 1963). Guitarist Michael Kelly Smith and drummer Tony Destra were also early members of the band, but they left in 1985 to form Britny Fox. Cinderella then added drummer Jody Cortez and continued as a four-piece. Insisting on playing original material, they performed in clubs and bars in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and in 1985 Jon Bon Jovi caught one of their shows. He was sufficiently impressed to alert his record company, Mercury, which signed the band. Their debut album, Night Songs, was released in June 1986. Shortly after its completion, Cortez left the band and was replaced by Fred Coury (born October 20, 1964). The LP was not an immediate success, but it gained momentum gradually while the band toured extensively as an opening act to promote it. It broke into the Billboard chart in July, and the track &quot;Shake Me,&quot; although it failed to chart as a single, got enough radio attention to turn up on Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart in August. On October 1, the album was certified gold. That month, Mercury released a second single, &quot;Nobody's Fool,&quot; accompanied by a music video that earned play on MTV; it broke into the charts in November and peaked at number 13 in February 1987. Its success further stimulated sales of the album, which was certified platinum in December 1986 and broke into the Top Ten by the end of the year; it peaked at number 3 in February 1987, and that same month was certified double platinum. In April, Mercury released a third single, &quot;Somebody Save Me,&quot; which peaked at number 66 in May. (The album was certified triple platinum in May 1991.)\n\nimage\nCinderella At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Stripped (Live)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. The More Things Change\n02. Push Push\n03.

Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnfinished BusinessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was also the name of their 1998 tour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and yes, most of us are already familiar with the live recordings made over the course of that tour, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we? This was first released over ten years ago as Ã¢â‚¬ËœLive At The Key ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s re-appeared a few times since; the songs recorded live at the Key Club in Hollywood, CA back in October 1998 have now resurfaced yet again. Enhanced with the two bonus tracks from CinderellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heyday of 1991, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new live compilation Ã¢â‚¬ËœStrippedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the same old song and dance nevertheless.\n\nThat said, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one certainty about classy live albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not necessarily only these included in Ã¢â‚¬Å“50 Best Live Albums EverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that is that you still enjoy the raw, authentic live cuts of the songs you know so well; even those youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been listening to for ages. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough musical flavours here to satisfy a demanding ear Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be it the Funky drum solo extended into an all-instrumental Bluesy jam in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFallinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Apart At The SeamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or the Country-infused, melodic six string outro of Ã¢â‚¬ËœComing HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough nostalgia-driven charming moments in the acoustic Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeartbreak StationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or the soaring Ã¢â‚¬ËœDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know What You Got (Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gone)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to make you start to rummage through your pockets for the obligatory lighter (even though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a late night home listening). Plus, each of the four bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums are represented here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even Ã¢â‚¬ËœStill ClimbingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with Ã¢â‚¬ËœHot &amp; BotheredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ appearing in the set. And alongside CinderellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœShake MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœGypsy RoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, there are rare goodies here as well, just take a listen to the 1991 bonus tracks being Ã¢â‚¬ËœSick For The CureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMake Your Own WayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nApart from it being more or less the same 1999 live album re-release, Ã¢â‚¬ËœStrippedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ still remains a testimony to CinderellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to charm both the crowd at the Key Club and all the listeners further on. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something we all may have heard before, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always worth having our memory refreshed by a dose of guitar laden, Blues-infused Hard Rock. And with bands as classy and talented as Cinderella, whose abilities to steal the show and leave the audience enchanted have been known for decades, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also certain that you will enjoy their listening experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and in this particular case, also the relapse of your seemingly overcome Cinderella addiction.\n\nHere's one for the &quot;Old school&quot;\n!\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Glam Metal / Hard Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 172.82 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n16 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8329ea0b53e0edc3cfabc036a89a7a6b32b699ff","amp;dn":"Cinderella+-+Stripped+%28Live%29+%282014%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8329ea0b53e0edc3cfabc036a89a7a6b32b699ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,41,234,11,83,224,237,195,207,171,192,54,168,154,122,107,50,182,153,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
