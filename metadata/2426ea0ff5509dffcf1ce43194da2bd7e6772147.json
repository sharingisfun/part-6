In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.\n\nThe series is set in the fictional South-Midlands town of Denton, and is marked by a gritty tone. It is believed that Denton is in Oxfordshire, with many references to Reading, Oxford, and in particular, Swindon, especially in the earlier episodes, as the M4 and A417 are often seen, and the map of Swindon was seen in the control room, although a map of Reading was used occasionally. The programme is produced by ITV in Leeds, and most of the outdoor locations are shot in West Yorkshire. Several scenes are filmed in and around the city and district of Wakefield and neighbouring small towns of Pontefract and Castleford, West Yorkshire.[3] The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor.\n\nSeason 8\n\nS8, Ep1 - Jan. 14, 2001 - Benefit of the Doubt: Part 1\nWorking with a problematic new partner, Frost investigates a homicide and a disappearance and has to prove that he is not the man harassing women in Denton.\n \nS8, Ep2 - Jan. 15, 2001 - Benefit of the Doubt: Part 2\nFrosts turns his energies to solving the murder of a doctor found with medical waste and stand by his problematic new partner despite pressure from Mullet.\n\nThis torrent includes the .xml and .jpg files for the WDTV Live SMP media library feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2426ea0ff5509dffcf1ce43194da2bd7e6772147","amp;dn":"A+Touch+of+Frost+-+Season+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2426ea0ff5509dffcf1ce43194da2bd7e6772147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,38,234,15,245,80,157,255,207,28,228,49,148,218,43,215,230,119,33,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
