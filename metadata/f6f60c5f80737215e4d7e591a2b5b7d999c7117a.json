Deemed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unfitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for civilians to see, the films were stashed away and forgotten.\n\nAs the French evacuated Paris in June 1940, amateur filmmakers documented the exodus as thousands lined the roads with their families and most precious possessions. As the British sifted through the rubble, people grabbed cameras to capture what it meant to stand up to Hitler throughout the Blitz. And as the Nazi army slogged through the mud and snow of Soviet Russia on the way to Moscow, soldiers used 8mm cameras to film the hardships of the war as they experienced it. This was not the stock, newsreel or propaganda footage from World War II that authorities approved and audiences became accustomed to seeing. This was provocative and sometimes disturbing footage taken by those who witnessed the war first-hand. This was the footage deemed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unfitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for civilians to see. At the end of the war, this and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTop SecretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ footage of the warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s destruction was stashed away and forgotten.\n\nThanks to the efforts of a few, private collectors and archivists, these forgotten films have been rediscovered, restored and made available by National Geographic Channel in an extraordinary six-part series: Apocalypse: The Second World War, to start from Wednesday September 2 at 8.30pm in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of World War II. In addition to stunning footage, the series presents WWII in an innovative and provocative way, giving audiences an unprecedented sense of the reality of war not conveyed by black and white footage.\n\nMade up entirely of original 35mm, 16mm and 8mm films, Apocalypse: The Second World War includes rare footage of the Polish officersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ massacre at Katyn, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, the inhumane treatment of French soldiers taken prisoner by the Nazis and the sacrifice of Soviet soldiers at Stalingrad. By bringing this incredible footage together, Apocalypse: The Second World War provides viewers with a ground-breaking portrait of WWII that depicts not only its complexity, but the perspectives of both its victims and its victors.\n\nEPISODES 6:\n\nINFERNO \n\nBombing of Germany; the Holocaust; V Day; the atomic bomb.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 47mn 0s 624ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nSubtitles         : None\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 247 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 368 (1.696) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 123 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f60c5f80737215e4d7e591a2b5b7d999c7117a","amp;dn":"Apocalypse-The+Second+World+War.%282008%29.6of6.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f60c5f80737215e4d7e591a2b5b7d999c7117a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,246,12,95,128,115,114,21,228,215,229,145,162,181,183,217,153,199,17,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
