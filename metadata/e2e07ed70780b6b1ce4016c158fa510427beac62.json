In the New Testament, we read a Gospel story in which Jesus turned water into excellent wine for the enjoyment of the wedding guests at Cana.\n\nEmphasizing the controversies resulting from the contradictions in the Bible, the Rev. William M. Thayer started his book 'Communion Wine and the Bible Temperance' with the following on page 3:\n\n&quot;That difficulties should attach to the Bible view of temperance is not strange. Difficulties attach to the Bible view of almost every important subject, so that biblical scholars and eminent divines are divided in opinion. Hence, the church visible is divided into denominations, based on different interpretations of the Scriptures. Hence, too, slavery, polygamy, and other evils, have been defended from the Bible by distinguished theologians. Is it strange, then, that biblical scholars and divine differ, to some extent, in their interpretation of the Scriptures on the Wine Question?&quot;\n\n\nIn contrast, in Islam there is no doubt or ambiguity about the teachings regarding consumption of liquors; it is considered a major sin and it is strongly prohibited. In the Qur'an Sura #5, Verses #90-92, we read:\n\n&quot;O Believers, intoxicants, gambling, idolatrous practices, and divining with arrows are repugnant acts (Satan's doing); shun them so that you may prosper. \nWith intoxicants and gambling, Satan seeks only to incite enmity and hatred among you, and to stop you remembering God and prayer; will you not give them up? \nObey God, obey the Messenger, and always be on your guard: if you pay no heed, bear in mind that the sole duty of Our Messenger is to deliver the message clearly.&quot;\n\nThe Traditions of Prophet Muhammad also strongly condemn the consumption of liquors. In one Tradition, the Prophet issued a stern warning to the one who drinks liquors that he will be punished in the hereafter by drinking from the mud of khibaal (the sweat of the people of Hell, or the juice of the people of Hell.)\n\nIn another Tradition, the Prophet said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhoever dies and has the habit of drinking liquors, he will meet Allah as one who worships idols.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nIn yet another Tradition, the Prophet, not only condemns the ones who drink liquors, but also condemns the ones: who participate in the manufacture of liquors, who distribute it, who sell it, who buy it, who transport it, who pour it in glasses and give it to the drinkers, and all who benefit financially from the liquors business.\n\n\nThis upload contains 24 titles.
