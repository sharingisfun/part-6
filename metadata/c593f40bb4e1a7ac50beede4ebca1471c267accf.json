Thanks guys! EAC and/or Audiochecker Logs included as needed. If anybody has Doug E Fresh's first album &quot;Oh, My God!&quot; please do make available in lossless, apparently it has never been released on CD, and I'm assuming digital altogether, so perhaps a decent vinyl rip is neccessary. Thanks. Kit \n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\n\nDouglas E. Davis (born September 17, 1966), better known by the stage name Doug E. Fresh, is an American rapper, record producer, and beat boxer, also known as the Human Beat Box. The pioneer of 20th-century American beatboxing, Fresh is able to accurately imitate drum machines and various special effects using only his mouth, lips, gums, throat, and a microphone. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Worlds Greatest Entertainer 1988\n\n\nThe World's Greatest Entertainer is the second album released by Doug E. Fresh. It was released in 1988 on Reality Records, a short-lived subsidiary of the legendary Fantasy Records, and was produced by Doug E. Fresh, Eric &quot;Vietnam&quot; Sadler, Ollie Cotton and Carl Ryder. The album gained a fair amount of success, peaking at #88 on the Billboard 200 and #7 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and featured the single &quot;Keep Risin' to the Top,&quot; which peaked at #4 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Guess?

Fresh. It was released April 27, 1992, on Bust It Records, a sub-label of Capitol Records set up by MC Hammer, and was produced by Doug E. Fresh. Compared to his previous two albums, both of which are considered hip-hop classics, DoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ What I Gotta Do was neither a critical nor a commercial success, peaking at only #47 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The single &quot;Bustin Out (On Funk)&quot; made it to #28 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. It samples the 1979 Rick James single &quot;BustinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Out.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;D.O.A.&quot;- 1:07\n2.\t&quot;BustinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Out (On Funk)&quot;- 4:01\n3.\t&quot;The Get Fresh Crew&quot;- 4:50\n4.\t&quot;Back in the Dayz&quot;- 4:48\n5.\t&quot;If I Was Your Man&quot;- 4:34\n6.\t&quot;Come in from the Rain&quot;- 5:28\n7.\t&quot;I Need My Woman Tonight&quot;- 5:00\n8.\t&quot;Check It Out&quot;- 3:43\n9.\t&quot;The History&quot;- 2:47\n10.\t&quot;Imagine Me Just Pumpin' It Up&quot;- 4:01\n11.\t&quot;You Make Me Wanna Shout&quot;- 4:42\n12.\t&quot;The Money Grip&quot;- 3:39\n13.\t&quot;There's Nothing Better&quot;- 4:26\n14.\t&quot;I Love Myself&quot;- 5:17\n15.\t&quot;&quot;No&quot;- 4:49\n16.\t&quot;Vida Mia&quot;- 2:26\n17.\t&quot;Peace to New York&quot;- 3:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay 1995\n\n\n\nPlay is the fourth album released by Doug E.
