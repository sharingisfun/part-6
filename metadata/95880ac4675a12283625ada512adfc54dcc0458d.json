Behind the walls of these celebrated strongholds are stories of intrigue, drama, romance, rebellion, and murder. Dan Jones recounts some of the many classic tales from 1000 years of British history, featuring a stellar cast of kings, queens, rogues, rebels, victims and villains.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Dover Castle \r\nDan begins by heading to the south-east of England to visit Dover Castle. He reveals that Henry II ordered its construction not only as a statement of royal power, but also out of guilt for the murder of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1170. Dan discovers how a vast network of tunnels was used to defend the castle, including underground barracks built during the Napoleonic Wars and a nuclear bunker created during the Cold War.\r\n\r\n2)  Tower of London \r\nDan Jones explores the turbulent history of the Tower of London, which is one of Britain's most famous buildings and has been a military fortress, a palace, a royal mint, a prison, a zoo and a place of execution. He reveals how one king's obsession with money led to the Tower becoming the focus of the worst Jewish massacre the country had ever seen and explains how a mob of disgruntled peasants managed to break through its defences as they sought bloody revenge for taxes they could no longer put up with\r\n\r\n3)  Warwick \r\nDan explores the history of Warwick Castle, which started as a motte and bailey fort established by William the Conqueror in 1068 and was transformed into a stone fortress two centuries later by the Beauchamp family. He examines the role Guy Beauchamp played in the kidnapping and murder of one of Edward II's closest allies and descends into the castle's claustrophobic dungeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Secrets-of-Great-British-Castles-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3148 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 42mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 937 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nThere are 6 episodes in this Series; I am waiting for the repeat of Part 6\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/secrets-of-great-british-castles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95880ac4675a12283625ada512adfc54dcc0458d","amp;dn":"Ch5+Secrets+Of+Great+British+Castles+Series+1+3of5+Warwick+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95880ac4675a12283625ada512adfc54dcc0458d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,136,10,196,103,90,18,40,54,37,173,165,18,173,252,84,220,192,69,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
