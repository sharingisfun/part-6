It demonstrates the role of functional programming in a wide spectrum of applications including databases and systems. Coverage also includes advanced features in the .NET library, the imperative features of F# and topics such as text processing, sequences, computation expressions and asynchronous computation. With a broad spectrum of examples and exercises, the book is perfect for courses in functional programming and for self-study. Enhancing its use as a text is an accompanying website with downloadable programs, lecture slides, a mini-projects and links to further F# sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82129610c51471853b40aacdfab49ed3e4d52b32","amp;dn":"Functional+Programming+Using+F%23+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82129610c51471853b40aacdfab49ed3e4d52b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,18,150,16,197,20,113,133,59,64,170,205,250,180,158,211,228,213,43,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
