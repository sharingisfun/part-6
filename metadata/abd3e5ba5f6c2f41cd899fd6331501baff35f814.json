Jesus knows that his parents, Joseph and Mary, keep secrets about his birth and treatment that makes you different from other boys. His parents, however, believe it is too early to tell the truth of his miraculous birth and its purpose. With the death of the King, they decide to return to his native Nazareth, not knowing that the heir to the throne, the new king is like his father and is determined to kill Jesus, while he discovers the truth about your life.\r\n\r\nVideo codec: MPEG-2\r\nCodec Audio: AC3 5.1\r\nAudio Language: English / Portuguese\r\nSubtitle: English / Portuguese\r\nVideo Quality: DVD-R\r\nExtension File: ISO\r\nResolution: 853 x 480\r\nFile size: 4.10 GB\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1002563/\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLEASE\r\n\r\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd3e5ba5f6c2f41cd899fd6331501baff35f814","amp;dn":"The+Young+Messiah+2016+DVD+R4+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd3e5ba5f6c2f41cd899fd6331501baff35f814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,211,229,186,95,108,47,65,205,137,159,214,51,21,1,186,255,53,248,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
