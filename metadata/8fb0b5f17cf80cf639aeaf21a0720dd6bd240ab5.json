The Greek myths are the founding narratives of Western civilization: to understand them is to know the origins of philosophy, literature, art, science, law, and more. Indeed, as Luc Ferry shows in this masterful book, they remain a great store of wisdom, as relevant to our lives today as ever before. No mere legends or clichÃƒÂ©s (&quot;Herculean task,&quot; &quot;Pandora's box,&quot; &quot;Achilles heel,&quot; etc.), these classic stories offer profound and manifold lessons, providing the first sustained attempt to answer fundamental human questions concerning &quot;the good life,&quot; the burden of mortality, and how to find one's place in the world. Vividly retelling the great tales of mythology and illuminating fresh new ways of understanding them, The Wisdom of the Myths will enlighten readers of all ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb0b5f17cf80cf639aeaf21a0720dd6bd240ab5","amp;dn":"The+Wisdom+of+the+Myths%3A+How+Greek+Mythology+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb0b5f17cf80cf639aeaf21a0720dd6bd240ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,176,181,241,124,248,12,246,57,174,175,33,160,114,13,214,189,36,10,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
