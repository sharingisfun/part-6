He goes through move by move, analyzing good (and sometimes poor) play, and contrasting moves made with other potential choices. Occasionally he will summarize comments made in regards to a particular strategy or situation and codify them into a type of rule or general law. That's it for the book!\n\nNonetheless, in doing so he is able to get inside the thinking of the top pros in a wide variety of positions, going into all phases of play from opening to doubling to bearing off. Generally well illustrated, the book is best used by replaying the games and questioning yourself as to how you might play a roll, then comparing with what took place and why. You will find your understanding of deeper backgammon strategy and play deepening with each rereading. Just to get you thinking 'beyond the race' makes this book a valuable addition to your gaming library. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Backgammon-Serious-Players-Bill-Robertie/product-reviews/158042077X/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;colid=&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Backgammon-Serious-Players-Bill-Robertie/product-reviews/158042077X/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;colid=&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980b777c223e39cd092602ec53ed87c0a02ae6f4","amp;dn":"Backgammon+for+Serious+Players+-+Bill+robertie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980b777c223e39cd092602ec53ed87c0a02ae6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,11,119,124,34,62,57,205,9,38,2,236,83,237,135,192,160,42,230,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
