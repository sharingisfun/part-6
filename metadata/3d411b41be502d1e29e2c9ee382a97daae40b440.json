Upon finding her grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journal in the attic, Nia is attacked by a barrage of feline assailants. It seems that her grandmother has become a crazy cat lady since last time she visited, so you will need to defend Nia by building a protective fort out of furniture to keep the cats at bay, while deciphering the mysterious tales hidden within the journal. \n\nBuild your own custom pillow fort out of household items to protect you from an onslaught of feline assailants as they tumble and claw their way through. Just be careful that your carefully constructed walls donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tumble down with them.\n\nEach item costs you some of your limited window of time before the next onslaught so choose wisely. As you unlock more time you can build more elaborate forts to deal with the increasingly challenging cat-assault","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d411b41be502d1e29e2c9ee382a97daae40b440","amp;dn":"Fort+Meow+v1.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d411b41be502d1e29e2c9ee382a97daae40b440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,65,27,65,190,80,45,30,41,226,201,238,56,42,151,218,174,64,180,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
