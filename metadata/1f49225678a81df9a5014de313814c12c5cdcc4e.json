Through a detailed and innovative re-assessment of the work of three architects who sought to represent a utopian content in their work, and a consideration of the thoughts of a range of leading writers, Coleman offers the reader a unique perspective of idealism in architectural design.\n\nWith unparalleled depth and focus of vision on the work of Le Corbusier, Louis I Kahn and Aldo van Eyck, this book persuasively challenges predominant assumptions in current architectural discourse, forging a new approach to the invention of welcoming built environments and transcending the limitations of both the postmodern and hyper-modern stance and orthodox modernist architecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f49225678a81df9a5014de313814c12c5cdcc4e","amp;dn":"Utopias+and+architecture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f49225678a81df9a5014de313814c12c5cdcc4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,73,34,86,120,168,29,249,165,1,77,227,19,129,76,18,197,205,204,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
