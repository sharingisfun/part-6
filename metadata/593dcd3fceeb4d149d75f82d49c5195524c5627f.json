You will learn how to install VMware Workstation in any circumstance, and how to create virtual machines and keep different configurations for each virtual machine, which helps in setting up extensive test environments. You will also learn how to share these virtual machines with users of other virtualization products as well as the cloud. In VMware Workstation: No Experience Necessary you will start learning about different virtualization solutions. In this introduction you will learn how VMware Workstation differs from other workstation virtualization platforms such as Oracle Virtual Box, and from data centre virtualization solutions such as VMware vSphere. \n\nNext, you will learn how to install VMware Workstation on either a Windows or a Linux host and how to create virtual machines on these host platforms. After installing virtual machines, you will learn about advanced virtual machine features, including advanced networking and storage setups, which allow you to mirror a data centre setup as closely as possible. An important part of the setup of such an environment is working with snapshots and clones, which is discussed in detail. \n\nYou will also learn how to use virtual machines that are created on other host computers. The final part of the book teaches you how to share virtual machines with others. You will learn how to upload virtual machines to VMware vSphere, and how to share virtual machines with users of VMware Player. \n\nWhat you will learn from this book:\n\nInstall VMware Workstation on Windows or Linux \nCreate Virtual Machines \nConfigure networking in virtual environments \nSet up a DMZ-test environment on one single machine \nAccess Virtual Machines running on other computers \nMultiply virtual machines by using clones \nEasily revert to a previous Virtual Machine state by using snapshot technology \nUpload Virtual machines to the cloud and vSphere \nShare virtual machines with VMware Player users \n\nApproach:\n\nThis book is a practical, step-by-step guide to creating and managing virtual machines using VMware Workstation. \n\nWho this book is written for:\n\nVMware Workstation: No Experience Necessary is for developers as well as system administrators who want to efficiently set up a test environment .You should have basic networking knowledge, and prior experience with Virtual Machines and VMware Player would be beneficial. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593dcd3fceeb4d149d75f82d49c5195524c5627f","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+No+Experience+Necessary+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593dcd3fceeb4d149d75f82d49c5195524c5627f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,61,205,63,206,235,77,20,157,117,248,45,73,197,25,85,36,197,98,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
