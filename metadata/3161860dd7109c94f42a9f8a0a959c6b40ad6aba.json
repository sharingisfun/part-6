The algorithmic knowledge and skills lost in high-level programming provides the justification demonstrated in this guide for using Assembly code. Working applications with detailed comments and descriptions of their operating principles, along with material that can be considered hackish, are included. The tools and techniques of code analysis and modification are covered, making this a useful tool for programmers eager to become better acquainted with hacker methods. Not a guide on Assembly language, this represents a symbiosis between the Assembly language and the Windows operating system.\n\nAbout the Author \n\nVlad Pirogov is an expert in the development of performance-effective applications for Windows who has designed and implemented software with Assembly. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3161860dd7109c94f42a9f8a0a959c6b40ad6aba","amp;dn":"The++Assembly++Programming++Master++Book+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3161860dd7109c94f42a9f8a0a959c6b40ad6aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,97,134,13,215,16,156,148,244,42,159,138,10,149,156,107,64,173,106,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
