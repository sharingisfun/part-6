Line them up on the counter, and there you have it: thousands of years of human history in six drinks.\n\nTom Standage opens a window onto the past in this tour of six beverages that remain essentials today. En route he makes fascinating forays into the byways of western culture: Why were ancient Egyptians buried with beer? Why was wine considered a Ã¢â‚¬Å“classierÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ drink than beer by the Romans? How did rum grog help the British navy defeat Napoleon? What is the relationship between coffee and revolution? And how did Coca-Cola become the number one poster-product for globalization decades before the term was even coined?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abcdd17cd4b7a074b20e74d276f2dccea485215","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+World+in+Six+Glasses+-+Tom+Standage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abcdd17cd4b7a074b20e74d276f2dccea485215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,188,221,23,205,75,122,7,75,32,231,77,39,111,45,204,234,72,82,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
