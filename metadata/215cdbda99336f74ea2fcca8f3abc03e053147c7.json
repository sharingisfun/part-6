Thomas\nCambridge University Press | June 2014 | ISBN-10: 0521133580 | PDF | 408 pages | 28.4 mb\n\nTrees are familiar components of many landscapes and have been vital in determining the ecology of our planet as well as the development of human cultures and communities. Yet how much do we really understand about how they work? This updated and revised edition provides a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of tree biology and ecology and presents the state-of-the-art discoveries in this area. The wonders and mysteries of trees are explored throughout the book and questions such as why leaves turn spectacular colours in the autumn, how water reaches the top of the tallest trees, or why the study of genetics has caused so many name changes in trees are all brilliantly answered. Written with a non-technical approach, this book will be a valuable source of reference for students and those with a less formal interest in this fascinating group of plants.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface ix\n1 An overview 1\n2 Leaves: the food producers 13\n3 The trunk and branches: more than a connecting drainpipe 51\n4 Roots: the hidden tree 102\n5 Towards the next generation: flowers, fruits and seeds 154\n6 The growing tree 204\n7 The shape of trees 245\n8 The next generation: new trees from old 284\n9 Age, health, damage and death: living in a hostile world 315\n10 Trees and us 376\nFurther reading 387\nIndex 389","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215cdbda99336f74ea2fcca8f3abc03e053147c7","amp;dn":"Trees+-+Their+Natural+History+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215cdbda99336f74ea2fcca8f3abc03e053147c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,92,219,218,153,51,111,116,234,47,204,168,243,171,192,62,5,49,71,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
