The game was later ported to the Dreamcast console and the Game Boy Color. It is the sequel to 1997 hit Grand Theft Auto. The PC and Dreamcast versions of GTA2 are both rated M by the ESRB. The language and violence were toned down for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color versions which received a T rating.[1] Rockstar now offers the PC version as registerware for free download at their website.[2] GTA2 was preceded by the original Grand Theft Auto and ultimately succeeded by Grand Theft Auto III. The game was made available on Steam on January 4, 2008.\n\nMinumum Specification:\nPentium 200 or above\nWindows 95/98/XP and newer\n65 MB of hard disk space\n32 MB of RAM\n4x CD ROM\nDirectX 6.1\nMultiplayer: LAN (IPX &amp; TCP/IP) 4 players plus Internet (via DirectPlay)\nDirect3D Compatible Graphics Card (REQUIRED)\nKeyboard\nSound Card (3D Sound Card Optional)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05f4aa738e801572e74a8773589dbcb03b058886","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+II+%28GTA+2%29+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05f4aa738e801572e74a8773589dbcb03b058886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,244,170,115,142,128,21,114,231,74,135,115,88,157,188,176,59,5,136,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
