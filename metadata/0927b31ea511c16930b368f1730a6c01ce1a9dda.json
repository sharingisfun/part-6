Other than pining after the girl of his dreams, Jenny Swanson (Amber Lancaster), receiving daily beatings from the meanest jock in school, Max Owens (Jayson Blair), and evading the stalker-ish advances of Lily Miran (Kara Taitz), there really isn\\'t much excitement in RJ\\'s life. That is, until his anatomical gift is accidentally exposed to the entire school. In a single moment, RJ goes from anonymous to infamous, and for the first time in his life, he feels a tiny sliver of confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n\n\n____________________________________________\n# | Title | Directed by | Original air date |\n__|_______|_____________|___________________|\n\n\n  |       |                  |              |\n1 | Pilot | David Katzenberg | June 6, 2010 |\n\nRJ Berger, the socially awkward teen has to play in a basketball game when several of the team members gets ejected from the game.

Meanwhile, Miles tries to act cool in front of several girls at once, saying he taught RJ everything he knows about acting. Opening night comes, with RJ and Jenny getting nervous about the big kiss between them. They plan everything out between them and RJ gets even more nervous since he\\'s afraid he may get a boner when he does. Miles duct tapes RJ\\'s penis to his leg to help curb this and help RJ go through with the scene, inadvertantly giving RJ a limp in the process. The scene comes and RJ gets a boner as Jenny leans into him, ripping the duct tape and casting a large shadow on the background in the shape of a tent with the audience laughing at RJ and Jenny in disgust.

As almost every girl in the school rejects them after asking, RJ decides that the one he should go with is Lily, who has been by him since childhood. RJ asks Lily to go with him and she gleefully accepts, planning on finally having sex with RJ. A short time afterwards, RJ notices Max breaking up with Jenny for an unknown reason and potentially sees an opportunity to finally get Jenny to notice him. Miles however, asks Robin to go with him to the dance and she sarcastically accepts, leaving Miles to believe she was sincere. Jenny tells RJ that she and Max are done and wants to go to the dance with RJ. RJ becomes confused as who he should go with and asks Coach Sinclair what he should do. Sinclair tells RJ that it may be tough for Lily to accept, but with his only opportunity with Jenny in sight, he should go for Jenny while he can. RJ eventually tries to tell Lily the bad news, until Lily accidentally walks into the street with a school bus crashing into her as she asks RJ \\&quot;What is it my lo...\\&quot;\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n   |                 |                  |                 |\n12 | The Right Thing | David Katzenberg | August 23, 2010 |\n\nThe aftermath of Lily getting hit by a bus leaves RJ in shock and grief stricken at the hospital. Everyone tells RJ that he should go to the dance and not worry too much about Lily. Eventually, RJ takes Jenny to the dance. When Miles goes to Robin\\'s house to take her, she asks what he\\'s doing there and she tells him that she was being sarcastic when she said \\'yes\\' to him. Embarrassed, Miles leaves as he notices that Max shows up, apparently taking Robin to the dance. As they arrive, RJ can only think of Lily, who is in a coma at the hospital. RJ leaves the dance hall, and sobs with Jenny finding RJ and kisses him. Even though RJ wants that, he tells her he needs to be by Lily\\'s side and begins to leave the school. Max attempts to stop RJ and tries to beat him up, over the fact that he is jealous of RJ taking Jenny, when Miles tackles Max and starts pummeling Max\\'s testicles, allowing RJ to leave. RJ goes to Lily and says he\\'s sorry about the night. Lily wakes up and says the night can still be special. RJ strips down and the two have sex in the hospital bed. RJ leaves the hospital with Lily having a smile on her face and a heart monitor flatlines with some of the hospital staff rushing, leaving it to believe that Lily is dead.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCast:\n____\n\nPaul Iacono...........................R.J.
