Quite a bit like \nthis media driven life since the main characters all act like they are at the top of their game (Like they are on some sort of \nmetaphysical stage.). Intermixed with the controversy of brutal and crazy honesty, there lies a hair of truth. Its the hair of \ntruth you have to see to feel. Side-lining the story the male main character has a recurrent assailant which breaks up the \nstream of events, in a mysterious way. The modern delusions held by the main character are complex and hard to understand, \neven as the movie comes to a close. However the delusions are made real leaving you really pondering something outside the \nbox (brain). As the story progresses and you learn more about the main character, his life gets entangles with those you are \nintroduced to. One is an old school friend, the other is a beautiful girl with an equally odd family. At times the drama \nappears as if it will turn depressing dwelling on the repressed emotions the characters are a part of. However Gigantic \nmanages to string you along until all is well and you are pondering whether such a story is possible in real life.\n\n \nPaul Dano ... Brian Weathersby\nZooey Deschanel ...
