He has also been friends with some of the most successful people in business history, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Rupert Murdoch, and Peter Drucker.\n\nNow this elder statesman reveals how great enterprises get into trouble. Even the smartest executives can fall into the trap of believing in their own infallibility. When that happens, more bad decisions are sure to follow.\n\nThis light-hearted Ã¢â‚¬Å“how-not-toÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ book includes anecdotes from Keough's long career as well as other infamous failures. His commandments for failure include: Quit Taking Risks; Be Inflexible; Assume Infallibility; Put All Your Faith in Experts; Send Mixed Messages; and Be Afraid of the Future.\n\nAs he writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“After a lifetime in business I've never been able to develop a step-by-step formula that will guarantee success. What I could do, however, was talk about how to lose. I guarantee that anyone who follows my formula will be a highly successful loser.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPaperback: 208 pages\nPublisher: Portfolio Trade; Reprint edition (June 28, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1591844134\nISBN-13: 978-1591844136\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
