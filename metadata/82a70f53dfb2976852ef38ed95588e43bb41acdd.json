Defeating it isn't hard, and you'll find the details on the Internet (Google is your friend).\n\nThis application is not for the faint of heart.  You'll need a Linux box and experience with the Linux command-line and Cisco IOS CLI.  &quot;How to&quot; documents are out there as well (again, Google is your friend).\n\nThis .torrent contains three images:  ipbase, adventerprise and a pagent image.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the first &quot;public&quot; release of Cisco IOU.
