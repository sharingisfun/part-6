The series originated from Frog Baseball, a 1992 short film by Judge. After seeing the short, MTV signed Judge to develop the concept. Beavis and Butt-head originally aired from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997. \n\nThe series was revived in 2011 and new episodes began airing on MTV on October 27, 2011.
