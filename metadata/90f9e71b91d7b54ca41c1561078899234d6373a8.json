Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.\n\nPhantasm CS Publisher v1.0 plugin for Adobe Illustrator with PDF manual.\n\nWith such a range of Illustrator plug-ins on the market, it's rare to come across one that excels to this extent.\n\nTo have all these features available in Illustrator (Adobe take note) and at such a modest price tag puts this product in a class of its own. We wholeheartedly recommend that any designer or studio add it to their software arsenal.\n\nDigital Arts rating: 4.5/5\n\nNo offense to Adobe, but if I want to change the color of my artwork I prefer using this plugin over the LiveColor feature. To me it feels more natural because it works and behaves the same as in Photoshop.\n\nIf you are very used to the Adjustments options in Photoshop such as: Brightness and Contrast, Curves, Levels, Desaturate, Hue and Saturation... You'll love this plugin.\n\nI'm usually not a big fan of plugins but this Illustrator one is really an exception to my own rules.\n\nFinal thoughts.\n\nThis might be one of the best and most useful Illustrator plugins that I have ever used. If you feel let down by the default color manipulation tools of Illustrator or have been dying to figure out how complex vector halftone patterns are created then I would seriously suggest purchasing this software. It will fundamentally change the way that you work with Illustrator and give you the color control that you've always wanted.\n\ncheck it out:-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.astutegraphics.com/products/phantasm/features.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.astutegraphics.com/products/phantasm/features.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f9e71b91d7b54ca41c1561078899234d6373a8","amp;dn":"Phantasm+CS+Publisher+v1.0+plugin+for+Adobe+Illustrator+with+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f9e71b91d7b54ca41c1561078899234d6373a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,249,231,27,145,215,181,76,164,28,21,97,7,136,153,35,77,99,115,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
