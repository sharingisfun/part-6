It can currently detect more than 600 different signatures in PE files.\n\n5.Runasdate -RunAsDate is a small utility that allows you to run a program in the date and time that you specify. This utility doesn't change the current system date and time of your computer, but it only injects the date/time that you specify into the desired application.\n\n6.SoftIce -SoftICE is a kernel mode debugger for Microsoft Windows. Crucially, it is designed to run underneath Windows such that the operating system is unaware of its presence. Unlike an application debugger, SoftICE is capable of suspending all operations in Windows when instructed.\n\n7.W32SASM -W32DASM is the perfect utility to learn how Windows programs operate.Disassembles Both 16 and 32 Bit Windows Programs. Displays for Exports, Imports, Menu, Dialog, and Text References.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ae11dd529dfc9b758eb0d13cb24fc4b4ad7291","amp;dn":"Software+Hacking+and+Cracking+Tools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ae11dd529dfc9b758eb0d13cb24fc4b4ad7291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,174,17,221,82,157,252,155,117,142,176,209,60,178,79,196,180,173,114,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
