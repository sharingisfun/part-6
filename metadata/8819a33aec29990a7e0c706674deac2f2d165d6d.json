The  legendary  silver  box  which  is  hallmark   in  ?\n         ?  electronic music has  been recreated in  AudioRealism  ?\n         ?  Bass  Line.  Analog  modeling  techniques  have  been  ?\n         ?  employed to  create a  DSP-algorithm that  accurately  ?\n         ?  emulates every aspect of the original Bass Line, from  ?\n         ?  growling basses to  hollow middles and  beeping highs  ?\n         ?  with metal rattling accents. Patterns are composed in  ?\n         ?  a fashion similar to the original Bass Line using the  ?\n         ?  integrated   step   sequencer   with   easy   to  use  ?\n         ?  manipulation   functions   such   as   transpose  and  ?\n         ?  randomization.                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  All controls  such at  cutoff and  resonance have  an  ?\n         ?  effective  range  that  is  unmatched  by  most other  ?\n         ?  software synthesizers. The characteristic 18dB/Octave  ?\n         ?  low-pass  filter  can  resonate  from  20Hz  to 22kHz  ?\n         ?  covering  the  whole  spectrum  of  sounds  that  the  ?\n         ?  original Bass Line produces.                           ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  Patterns are selected via MIDI and played in  perfect  ?\n         ?  sync  with  the   host  sequencer.  In   addition  an  ?\n         ?  alternative  Midi  mode   allows  you  to   play  the  ?\n         ?  synthesizer  like  a normal  device  via keyboard  or  ?\n         ?  external sequencer.
