Nine well-known Catholics, including Scott and Kimberly Hahn, Jeff Cavins, Tim Gray, and Leon Suprenant-open the pages of God's family album (the Bible) to provide compelling explanations of Mary's role in salvation history and in our daily lives as Christians. The result is a moving tribute and convincing testimony that demolishes common misconceptions about Catholic teaching on Mary. You'll learn why the Catholic Church teaches that Mary was immaculately conceived, remained always a virgin, and was assumed body and soul into heaven. You'll understand how Mary is the fulfillment of the Old Testament images. Most of all, you'll discover what it means to be a child of Mary in the Church. This second edition has been expanded with over 40 pages of new material from Scott Hahn on the Luminous Mysteries and the biblical basis of the Marian dogmas. Authors: Scott Hahn, Curtis A.
