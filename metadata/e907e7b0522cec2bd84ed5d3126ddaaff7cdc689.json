The original concept was to edit both versions into one final product. One version contained footage of an all-nude, all-male cast and was never released publicly as an independent film. The other version, with the actors and Viva wearing G-strings, was shown at the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street as one of Warhol's series of sexploitation films, or nudies as he liked to call them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x544, 25.000 fps, 1000 Kbps, 01h34m42s\r\nAudio: MP3, 44100 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles Italian and Spanish\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/35djk9ssm/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e907e7b0522cec2bd84ed5d3126ddaaff7cdc689","amp;dn":"The+Nude+Restaurant+%5B1967+-+USA%5D+Andy+Warhol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e907e7b0522cec2bd84ed5d3126ddaaff7cdc689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,7,231,176,82,44,236,43,216,78,213,211,18,109,218,175,247,205,198,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
