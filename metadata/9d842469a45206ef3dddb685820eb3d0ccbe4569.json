Slade \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 1311 pages \r\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (December 17, 2013) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781439881309 \r\n\r\n\r\nCovering the theory, application, and testing of contact materials, Electrical Contacts: Principles and Applications, Second Edition introduces a thorough discussion on making electric contact and contact interface conduction; presents a general outline of, and measurement techniques for, important corrosion mechanisms; considers the results of contact wear when plug-in connections are made and broken; investigates the effect of thin noble metal plating on electronic connections; and relates crucial considerations for making high- and low-power contact joints. It examines contact use in switching devices, including the interruption of AC and DC circuits with currents in the range 10mA to 100kA and circuits up to 1000V, and describes arc formation between open contacts and between opening contacts. Arcing effects on contacts such as erosion, welding, and contamination are also addressed.\r\n\r\nContaining nearly 3,000 references, tables, equations, figures, drawings, and photographs, the book provides practical examples encompassing everything from electronic circuits to high power circuits, or microamperes to mega amperes. The new edition:\r\n\r\n- Reflects the latest advances in electrical contact science and technology\r\n- Examines current research on contact corrosion, materials, and switching\r\n- Includes updates and revisions in each chapter, as well as up-to-date references and new figures and examples throughout\r\n- Delivers three new chapters on the effects of dust contamination, electronic sensing for switching systems, and contact phenomena for micro-electronic systems (MEMS) applications\r\n\r\nWith contributions from recognized experts in the field, Electrical Contacts: Principles and Applications, Second Edition assists practicing scientists and engineers in the prevention of costly system failures, as well as offers a comprehensive introduction to the subject for technology graduate students, by expanding their knowledge of electrical contact phenomena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d842469a45206ef3dddb685820eb3d0ccbe4569","amp;dn":"Electrical+Contacts%3A+Principles+and+Applications%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d842469a45206ef3dddb685820eb3d0ccbe4569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,132,36,105,164,82,6,239,61,221,182,133,130,14,179,208,204,190,69,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
