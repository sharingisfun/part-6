It has been estimated that 90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years. At the enterprise level, though, only about a quarter of this data actually has business value. Storing and maintaining unneeded data debris is costly and diverts resources away from the management of high value information. Organizations need to adopt information governance (IG) policies in order to streamline and systematize approaches to Big Data and to more efficiently meet compliance and legal demands. Information Governance is the first book to address both the bigÃ¢â‚¬â€œpicture concepts and the proven, detailed best practices that are central to deploying IG. This book addresses the five key impact areas of IG, as set out in the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM): Legal Functions, Records and Information Management (RIM), Information Technology (IT), Privacy Security, and Business Operations. Leading subject matter experts such as Barclay Blair, Monica Crocker, Charles Dollar, Randy Kahn, Esq., Barry Murphy, and others provide valuable new insights. Specific recommended processes, technologies, and best practices are presented in a clear, understandable format. For midÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and largeÃ¢â‚¬â€œsized enterprises, information is a key source of value. But retaining excessive information also carries legal and compliance risks. In Information Governance , Robert Smallwood demonstrates just how costly mismanaged information can be. To minimize risk related to poor IG, organizations need to pare information down to the essentials and secure it properly. Inside, learn how to do these things the right way, to ensure compliance with internal governance requirements and external regulatory and legal demands. If information governance is so important, why have IG programs not been adopted by more organizations? And more importantly, why have so many existing IG programs failed so miserably? Smallwood explains that costs and benefits associated with information governance are still not widely understood. In the pages of Information Governance, the author builds the business case for IG through a comprehensive, pioneering approach for informationÃ¢â‚¬â€œrelated risk assessments that leverages high value information. Carrying out wellÃ¢â‚¬â€œconsidered IG initiatives is not easy, particularly when so much valuable information is stored and accessed by thirdÃ¢â‚¬â€œparty service providers. Social media, mobile computing, and cloud computing, and certainly traditional eÃ¢â‚¬â€œmail, are exposed to leakage and theft risks. Even discarding unneeded information in a legally defensible way can be quite challenging. Information Governance addresses the practicalities of managing these various information platforms. This comprehensive bookthe most comprehensive ever compiled on IGis an essential resource to equip enterprises with a sound approach to governing and leveraging information in the age of Big Data.\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe first comprehensive approach to Information Governance By now, everyone knows that information can be enormously valuable, but how is that value affected by the huge costs involved in storing and maintaining it? How can organizations separate the irrelevant sludge of information from the real data goldmines? Crucially, how can information be kept, stored, secured, accessed, and when necessary, destroyed in a way that is consistent with legal requirements? Information Governance provides answers to these questions and many more. From broad concepts to the nuts and bolts of implementation, this book is an essential first step in any successful IG program. Information Governance is for CIOs, legal advisors, governance and compliance professionals, records managers, and anyone who is involved in managing content and information at an enterprise level. The field of IG is about more than just transferring traditional records management strategies to new technologies. Readers will learn about: The key components of a successful IG program Risk assessment for information governance Developing and implementing internal IG policies Legally defensible disposal of unneeded data Appraising the value of existing records and documents Electronic document security (EDS) technologies and policies IG for social media, eÃ¢â‚¬â€œmail, mobile devices, and eÃ¢â‚¬â€œrecords Privacy considerations and regulations With a career of over 25 years in information management concentrating in electronic document technologies, noted authority Robert Smallwood has developed an expert approach to IG that is an important element of longÃ¢â‚¬â€œterm program success.
