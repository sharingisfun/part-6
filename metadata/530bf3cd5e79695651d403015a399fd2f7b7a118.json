Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the &quot;big four&quot; thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States.\n\nSlayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, necrophilia, Satanism, religion, anti-religion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically.\n\nSince its debut album in 1983, the band has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song Eyes of the Insane, and one in 2008 for the song &quot;Final Six&quot; (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest.\n\n\nYear: 2015\nCountry: Usa\nGenre: Thrash Metal \nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 320Kbps\nSize: 97 MB\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01 Delusions Of Saviour 1:55\n02 Repentless 3:19\n03 Take Control 3:13\n04 Vices 3:32\n05 Cast The First Stone 3:43\n06 When The Stillness Comes 4:20\n07 Chasing Death 3:44\n08 Implode 3:49\n09 Piano Wire 2:48\n10 Atrocity Vendor 2:54\n11 You Against You 4:20\n12 Pride In Prejudice 4:13\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rocknvivo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Slayer-Repentless.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rocknvivo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Slayer-Repentless.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530bf3cd5e79695651d403015a399fd2f7b7a118","amp;dn":"Slayer+-+Repentless+%282015%29+%5BMetal%5D+%282015%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530bf3cd5e79695651d403015a399fd2f7b7a118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,11,243,205,94,121,105,86,81,212,3,1,90,57,159,210,247,183,161,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
