People might be interested to know that this book is based on the script to the Doctor Who novel Shada. There is a good version of Shada by Big Finish with Paul McGann as well as an audio book!\r\n\r\nI LOVE the cast of this audio drama, especially Billy Boyd! He SHINES! It was such a surprise to hear his voice the first time I heard this that I was stunned. Pippin from the Hobbit!\r\n\r\nLike I said, this is a very loose adaptation but features all the great things like the believing monk (my personal favorite in the WORLD!). \r\n\r\nThis was created by Dirk Maggs, who is HUGE in the British audio world with Big Finish and about a million other productions. He really took up Douglas's mantle after his friend's untimely death!\r\n\r\nSo, wear a towel, put the kettle on, and ENJOY this incredible RARE audio drama!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab20dc139692d3f6069bd5584d688baa7328ee51","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Dirk+Gentlys+Holistic+Detective+Agency+-+Douglas+Adams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab20dc139692d3f6069bd5584d688baa7328ee51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,32,220,19,150,146,211,246,6,155,213,88,77,104,139,170,115,40,238,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
