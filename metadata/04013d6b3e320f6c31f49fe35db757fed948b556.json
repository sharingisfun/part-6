Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash, Holly is described by critic Bruce Elder as &quot;the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.&quot;[1] His works and innovations inspired and influenced contemporary and later musicians, notably The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, and exerted a profound influence on popular music.[2] Holly was among the first group of inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.[3] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Holly #13 among &quot;The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial Collection 2008\n\n\nMemorial Collection is a 2009 compilation album of American singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter and rock and roll pioneer Buddy Holly's master takes and hit singles, including some rare recordings.
