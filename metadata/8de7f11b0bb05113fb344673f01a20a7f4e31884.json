His obsession with art he considered pure, in opposition to the supposedly degenerate avant-garde works by Jewish and Soviet artists, reveals itself to be deeply connected to Hitler's equally subjective and strict ideal of physical beauty and health.\n\nHitler is shown as an amateur architect who spends a lot of time planning designs of new buildings for the Reich and acquiring paintings and sculptures that reinforce his vision. At one point in the film, Cohen questions Hitler's grasp of reality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8de7f11b0bb05113fb344673f01a20a7f4e31884","amp;dn":"The+Architecture+of+Doom+%28Nazi+Aesthetics+lead+to+Holocaust%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8de7f11b0bb05113fb344673f01a20a7f4e31884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,231,241,27,11,176,81,19,251,52,70,115,240,26,32,167,244,227,24,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
