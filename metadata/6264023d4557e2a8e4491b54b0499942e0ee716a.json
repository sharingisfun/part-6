A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n \n - This is a long movie and I made it a higher-than-average quality to preserve the gorgeous cinematography; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so BE PATIENT. Another underrated gem; I'd give it at least an 8.0, so it's worth the wait.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At nearly 1.5GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6264023d4557e2a8e4491b54b0499942e0ee716a","amp;dn":"Far+From+The+Madding+Crowd+%281967%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6264023d4557e2a8e4491b54b0499942e0ee716a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,100,2,61,69,87,226,168,228,73,27,84,176,73,153,66,224,238,113,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
