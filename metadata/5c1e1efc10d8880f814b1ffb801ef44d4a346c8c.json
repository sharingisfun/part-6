Its best pieces are the moody jazz of &quot;Red Guitar,&quot; the dusky atmosphere of &quot;Weathered Wall,&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; itself, both of which feature the woozy trumpet of Eno collaborator and fourth-world pioneer Jon Hassell. The record also showcases guest players like Holger Czukay. Some CD editions also carry the three-part &quot;Words With the Shaman&quot; to make up a fuller album.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;/&quot;Bamboo Music&quot;:\n&quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; is a song by Japanese musician and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and English musician, composer and singer David Sylvian, released on Virgin Records in 1982. The double A-side single &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;/&quot;Bamboo Music&quot; was the first solo project by Sylvian, released while he was still a member of the band Japan. It was the second collaboration between the two, the first being the track &quot;Taking Islands in Africa&quot; on the 1980 Japan album Gentlemen Take Polaroids which featured Sakamoto on keyboards. The &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; single in turn featured drums by Japan member Steve Jansen, who also appeared in the promo video, and was co-produced by Steve Nye.\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;:\n&quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; is a song composed by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto with lyrics by English musician, composer and singer David Sylvian. The song is the vocal version of the theme from the Nagisa Oshima film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (in certain territories retitled Furyo) and was first released on the soundtrack album. &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;, also issued as a duet single on Virgin Records in 1983, was the second collaborative single release by Sylvian and Sakamoto, following 1982's &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;. The title of the song and its lyrics reflect the main themes of the movie; the clashes between not only two countries at war but also two vastly different cultures, difficulties on both sides in accepting or even trying to understand the differences in mentality, the contrasting definitions of honour and shame, as well as the underlying homoerotic tension between the two main characters, Japanese Captain Yonoi (played by Sakamoto himself) and British war prisoner Jack Celliers (David Bowie), and the fine line between love and hate and consequently life and death - hence &quot;my love wears forbidden colours&quot;. In 1984 the track was re-recorded and released as the B-side to &quot;Red Guitar&quot;, the lead single to Sylvian's first solo album Brilliant Trees and was later also included as a bonus track on certain editions of his 1987 album Secrets of the Beehive.&quot;\n\nRecommended listening: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5077832/ALICE_(Carla_Bissi)_-_Il_Sole_Nella_Pioggia_[1989__320_kbps]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5077832/ALICE_(Carla_Bissi)_-_Il_Sole_Nella_Pioggia_[1989__320_kbps]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST\nBrilliant Trees (1984)\n=======================\n\n01.
