The collection is part of a series of Essential sets released by Sony BMG (previously Sony Music Entertainment). Per liner notes comments by Springsteen, the collection was intended as an introduction to his music for new fans who attended shows on The Rising Tour; hence, it includes songs from every Springsteen album since his debut. The album was available as a 2-disc set and, later, as a limited edition 3-disc set; for the latter, the third disc contained a selection of rarities and previously unreleased recordings.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart on November 29, 2003 at number 14, with sales of 90,000 copies. It spent 13 weeks on the chart. The album was awarded certified gold and platinum records on December 16, 2003 by the RIAA. The Essential Bruce Springsteen also reached #28 in UK albums chart.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Blinded by the light                                 [05:05]\n02.For you                                              [04:41]\n03.Spirit in the night                                  [05:00]\n04.4th of july, asbury park (sandy)                     [05:38]\n05.Rosalita (come out tonight)                          [07:04]\n06.Thunder road                                         [04:51]\n07.Born to run                                          [04:33]\n08.Jungleland                                           [09:37]\n09.Badlands                                             [04:05]\n10.Darkness on the edge of town                         [04:31]\n11.The promised land                                    [04:31]\n12.The river                                            [05:01]\n13.Hungry heart                                         [03:21]\n14.Nebraska                                             [04:30]\n15.Atlantic city                                        [03:57]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.Born in the U.S.A.
