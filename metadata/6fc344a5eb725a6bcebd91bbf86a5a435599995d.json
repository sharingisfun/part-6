Similar to a programming language, it provides a complete environment for doing math. This course shows information workers how to perform advanced data analysis using Mathematica 9.\n\nCurt Frye teaches you how to set up Mathematica notebooks, assign values to variables, perform simple calculations, create and manipulate matrices, enter equations in linear and descriptive form, write and debug Mathematica scripts, and visualize data with charts.\n\nNOTE: Basic knowledge of linear algebra is helpful for this course, but not required.\nTopics include:\n\n    Managing Mathematica workbooks\n    Assigning values to variables\n    Calculating values with built-in functions\n    Manipulating matrices\n    Importing and exporting data\n    Defining functions\n    Creating charts\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc344a5eb725a6bcebd91bbf86a5a435599995d","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+Mathematica+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc344a5eb725a6bcebd91bbf86a5a435599995d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,195,68,165,235,114,90,107,206,189,145,187,248,106,90,67,85,153,153,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
