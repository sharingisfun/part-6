Almost 40 Ventures' albums charted, and 17 hit the Top 40. And though the group's popularity in America virtually disappeared by the 1970s, their enormous contribution to pop culture was far from over; the Ventures soon became one of the most popular world-wide groups, with dozens of albums recorded especially for the Japanese and European markets. They toured continually throughout the 1970s and '80s -- influencing Japanese pop music of the time more than they had American music during the '60s.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ventures-p5756/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ventures-p5756/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbums included:\n\nThe Ventures - 10th Anniversay Album (1970) + Only Hits (1973) (2 CDs) [1998]\nThe Ventures - Alive Five-0, Greatest Hits Live (2005) (2 CDs)\nThe Ventures - Greatest Hits [MRC Productions] (1988)\nThe Ventures - In The Vaults (1997)\nThe Ventures - In The Vaults, Vol. 2 (1999)\nThe Ventures - In The Vaults, Vol. 3 (2005)\nThe Ventures - In The Vaults, Vol. 4 (2007)\nThe Ventures - Joy!
