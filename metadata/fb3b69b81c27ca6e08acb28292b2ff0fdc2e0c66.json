This long-awaited fourth edition maintains the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cookbook&quot; features and Excel dependence that have made the previous editions so popular. As in previous editions, basic and advanced models in the areas of corporate finance, portfolio management, options, and bonds are explained with detailed Excel spreadsheets. Sections on technical aspects of Excel and on the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) round out the book to make Financial Modeling a complete guide for the financial modeler.\n\nThe new edition of Financial Modeling includes a number of innovations. A new section explains the principles of Monte Carlo methods and their application to portfolio management and exotic option valuation. A new chapter discusses term structure modeling, with special emphasis on the Nelson-Siegel model. The discussion of corporate valuation using pro forma models has been rounded out with the introduction of a new, simple model for corporate valuation based on accounting data and a minimal number of valuation parameters.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface xxi\nBefore All Else 1\n1 CORPORATE FINANCE AND VALUATION 11\n1 Basic Financial Calculations 13\n2 Corporate Valuation Overview 53\n3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 71\n4 Valuation Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 117\n5 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 127\n6 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar 161\n7 Financial Analysis of Leasing 179\n\nII PORTFOLIO MODELS 195\n8 Portfolio ModelsÃ¢â‚¬â€Introduction 197\n9 Calculating Efficient Portfolios 221\n10 Calculating the Variance-Covariance Matrix 251\n11 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line 273\n12 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales 291\n13 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization 305\n14 Event Studies 331\n\nIII VALUATION OF OPTIONS 359\n15 Introduction to Options 361\n16 The Binomial Option Pricing Model 383\n17 The Black-Scholes Model 425\n18 Option Greeks 467\n19 Real Options 493\n\nIV VALUING BONDS 515\n20 Duration 517\n21 Immunization Strategies 539\n22 Modeling the Term Structure 553\n23 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns 579\n\nV MONTE CARLO METHODS 605\n24 Generating and Using Random Numbers 607\n25 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods 655\n26 Simulating Stock Prices 675\n27 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 699\n28 Value at Risk (VaR) 723\n29 Simulating Options and Option Strategies 745\n30 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing 775\n\nVI TECHNICAL CHAPTERS 821\n31 Data Tables 823\n32 Matrices 839\n33 Excel Functions 855\n34 Array Functions 899\n35 Some Excel Hints 913\n\nVII VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS (VBA) 943\n36 User-Defined Functions with VBA 945\n37 Variables and Arrays 989\n38 Subroutines and User Interaction 1023\n39 Objects and Add-Ins 1047\n\nSelected References 1073\nIndex 1085\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nSimon Benninga is Professor of Finance and Director of the Sofaer International MBA program at the Faculty of Management at Tel-Aviv University.
