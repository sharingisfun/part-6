That changes with English Oceans, the band's tenth studio album, where Cooley gets co-star status for a change -- he penned six of the album's 13 tunes, and sings lead on Hood's &quot;Til He's Dead or Rises.&quot; By accident or design, the increased presence of Cooley's songs gives English Oceans a feel of call and response, as Cooley's smart but plainspoken style faces off against Hood's more artful approach as they both spin tales of characters struggling to make sense of the world around them. While the album opens with a world-class rocker, Cooley's &quot;Shit Shots Count,&quot; which could pass for a Dixie-fried outtake from Exile on Main St., for the most part English Oceans finds the Truckers in a thoughtful, low-key mood, with the guitar firepower dialed back a bit and both writers imagining characters whose lives range from the poignant (&quot;Primer Coat,&quot; &quot;When He's Gone&quot;) to the bitter (&quot;The Part of Him&quot;) to the tragic (&quot;Made Up English Oceans,&quot; &quot;When Walter Went Crazy&quot;).
