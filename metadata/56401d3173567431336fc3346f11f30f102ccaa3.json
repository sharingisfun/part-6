The rediscovery of the splendour of ancient Greece and Rome marked the beginning of the rebirth of the arts following the break down of the dogmatic certitude of the Middle Ages. A number of artists began to innovate in the domains of painting, sculpture and architecture. Depicting the ideal and the actual, the sacred and the profane, the period provided a frame of reference which influenced European art over the next four centuries. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Giorgione, Mantegna, Raphael, Durer and Bruegel are among the artists who made considerable contributions to the art of the Renaissance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56401d3173567431336fc3346f11f30f102ccaa3","amp;dn":"Renaissance+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56401d3173567431336fc3346f11f30f102ccaa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,64,29,49,115,86,116,49,51,111,195,52,111,17,243,15,16,44,202,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
