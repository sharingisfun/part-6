Cooking shows featured all gourmet creations and web sites displayed artfully photographed delights.\n\nThen something changed.\n\nPerhaps it was the desensitizing of web culture or perhaps it was a cry for help from the food-loving public. But by God - there came a day when fancy vegetable towers came crashing down and $50 mushrooms were no longer acceptable. Amason and Blakley wanted see the old stand-bys, the carnival foods of their childhoods, the sticky mess of a deep-fried candy bar, the indulgence of a greasy burger with all the fixins.\n\nIt was the birth of the nasty food web-trend. And it was delicious.\n\nThe website This is Why YouÃ¢â‚¬Â²re Fat is an ode to this trend - whether seen as a commentary on North American dietary habits or a celebration of the deliciously bad - Amason and Blakey are devoted to the worldÃ¢â‚¬Â²s newfound obsession with over-the-top food. Within its first month the site pulled in over ten million eye balls, and attracted major nation media including CNN. The world cooked, they listened.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jAFHZvt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jAFHZvt.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304b3a3806c4caab816b5270e4dc0aac0b598873","amp;dn":"This+Is+Why+You%27re+Fat+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304b3a3806c4caab816b5270e4dc0aac0b598873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,75,58,56,6,196,202,171,129,107,82,112,228,220,10,172,11,89,136,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
