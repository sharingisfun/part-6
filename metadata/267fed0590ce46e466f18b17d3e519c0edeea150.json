It originates from a two-semester course sequence at Rutgers University that is meant to appeal not only to astrophysics students but also more broadly to physics and engineering students. The organization is driven more by physics than by astronomy; in other words, topics are first developed in physics and then applied to astronomical systems that can be investigated, rather than the other way around","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267fed0590ce46e466f18b17d3e519c0edeea150","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Astrophysics%3A+Using+Gravity+and+Stellar+Physics+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267fed0590ce46e466f18b17d3e519c0edeea150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,127,237,5,144,206,70,228,102,241,139,23,211,229,25,192,237,238,161,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
