Atkins produced records for Perry Como, Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Eddy Arnold, Don Gibson, Jim Reeves, Jerry Reed, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, Waylon Jennings and others.\n\nAmong many honors, Atkins received 14 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, nine Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards, and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Atkins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Atkins&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAMG reviewby Thom Jurek\n\nDespite the fact that this isn't on RCA and one can debate the &quot;very best-of&quot; in the title some, this is nonetheless a great double-disc collection by guitar great and country music pioneer Chet Atkins. These 40 sides cover the 1940s,\n'50s, and early '60s as Atkins developed as an artist who sang cowboy songs in quartets, into a swashbuckling guitarist, and finally as a countrypolitain superstar -- a sound he developed in Nashville studios while heading RCA's country division. Whether it's killer pickin' swing, such as on &quot;Canned Heat,&quot; or the easy yet jazzy country of &quot;Indian Love Call,&quot; or the bluegrass inspired &quot;Main Street Breakdown,&quot; Atkins' genius is on display in spades. In addition to the music, there is complete discographical annotation inside, and a decent if rudimentary liner essay. Best of all, the price is extremely\nattractive. This is one well worth seeking out as a great mix for the seasoned fan and the merely curious. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-chet-atkins-columbia-r871863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-chet-atkins-columbia-r871863&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nChet Atkins &amp; Mark Knopfler - The Best Of Chet Atkins\nColumbia 2001\n\n01  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Poor Boy Blues (with Mark Knopfler)\n02  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Young Thing\n03  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Cheek To Cheek\n04  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Dream\n05  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Read My Licks\n06  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - I Still Write Your Name In The Snow\n07  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Ave Maria\n08  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - There'll Be Some Changes Made (with Mark Knopfler)\n09  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - After You've Gone\n10  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Love Letters\n11  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Pu, Uana Hulu (Remembering Gabby)\n12  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Every Now And Then\n13  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Jam Man\n14  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Sometime, Someplace\n15  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins -  Sweet Dreams (with Mark Knopfler)\n16  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - My Song\n17  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - Laffin' At Life\n18  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins - On A Roll\n19  Chet Atkins - The Best Of Chet Atkins -  Sunrise (with George Benson)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f6b0832f74911d4c64cdac4816c046849456e6","amp;dn":"Chet+Atkins+-+The+Best+Of+Chet+Atkins+%282001%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f6b0832f74911d4c64cdac4816c046849456e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,246,176,131,47,116,145,29,76,100,205,172,72,22,192,70,132,148,86,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
