Stakes escalate as they are personally targeted by an \nevil terrorist organization. Used to protecting the lives of others, \nTeam Rainbow must now embark on a mission to fight and save some of their own.\n\n\nRipped----&gt;Briefing Vids/MulTiplayer&lt;----- the rest is ALL here.\n       \n      ---- HD SPACE REQUIRED - 5 GIGS-------\n\nOK guys, for those STILL unsure, RIPPED means REMOVED\nNo longer included, went bye-bye, Not Here, GONE. ???\n\n\nMore Notes:\nThis game was protected with starforce 3. REMOVED.\nALSO: Updated to version 1.01. --There is no crack for v1.01\nSo, I decoded the exectuable packaging on the patch, extracted the files,\nand then replaced only the needed game files with new patch files, \nFixes on sound and movement have been applied. -cheers\n\nI have started to outsource some testing for my newer games, I would never have \nthe time. It is next to impossible for I, alone, to test a complete game.  \nI triple-test ALWAYS for game stabilty and fix,  or rescript, or update  \nany data necessary to prevent any issues or of course a CTD.\nThis is why MOHPA went bad. I forgot to include weapons pack, however, this had\nno effect on the games stability, where as normally, the game would have produced\nblatent errors without a specific pak. file.\n\n&gt;For those whom wonder whats I DO&lt; I do not include the following &amp;#039;boring&amp;#039;\ndata for which I do on each realease, cuz, well, why??? -but here is some sample\ninfo.Maybe you now know at least a little more,-- But, each &amp; every game is diff.\n\nSoMe info on the MOHPA game:\n MOHPA game files are encoded in \nwhat are called .rez extension pak files, each containing data in upwards of\n1.2 gigs per pak file. ALL these, 8 to be exact, were decoded and extracted\nin order to RIP (remove) what I CONsider &amp;#039;wasteful data&amp;#039;. The pak files were \nthen repacked with only the necessary data therefore decreasing the games \noriginal retail size by 3 gigs. During this &amp;#039;repak&amp;#039; process is when I missed to\nreplace the weapons. After repaking, I then had to rescript the necessary game\nfiles to read only now from which I have left in the game, otherwise, CTD.\nSo, because I actually made two mistakes, I both forgot to recript AND repak \nthe weapons, so no error was produced during gameplay. A next to zero percent \nchance of happening. normally at least only one of two erros would occur and \nduring games testing this would easily show.\nSo, no pickup on my part, as I thought the dickbag had to earn his weapon, \nI was running around getting shot up like a piece of swiss cheese. Waiting to \nreceive my weapon. That never happened...lol\n\nso,rescripted the weapons and produced an &amp;#039;unpaked&amp;#039; REZ file\nas a fix for the game.-\n\n-&amp;#039;Starfuck&amp;#039; fucked LOCKDOWN v1.0 with no weapons sound,.\nincluded here is v1.01 sound &amp; movement. yeeah mon.\nAlso pre-loaded saved game file is already here. Access to everything.\nTo remove this, but why? Go to the games/data/saves folder.\n\ngrrreeeetzz. -no fixes needed here mates. She&amp;#039;s already fixed. woohooooo!!\n\n\n\nunrar RSL.7z with latest winrar\n\nDouble-Click setup.reg to enter registry settings\n\nstart with Lockdown.exe \n\n\nEnjoy.                                \n\n\n                                    InFo:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/tomclancysrainbowsix4/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/tomclancysrainbowsix4/index.html&lt;/a&gt;    \n\n\n\nAscii Art by: GMSi\n00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n                     &quot;Install Nothing, Play Everything.&quot;\n00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df35061a7b00967b7cb9e1aee9fbd6bfcb89199f","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+Rainbow+Six+Lockdown+%5BRIP%5D+%5Bdopeman%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df35061a7b00967b7cb9e1aee9fbd6bfcb89199f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,53,6,26,123,0,150,123,124,185,225,174,233,251,214,191,203,137,25,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
