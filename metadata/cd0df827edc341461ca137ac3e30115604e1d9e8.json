Hard         \n         work is what has brought us where we are today, and hard work         \n         is also what we would expect from you.                                \n                                                                               \n         Given the amount of hours we all put into this every day, we          \n         like to see our self as a secondary family. We strive to take         \n         care of each other and thus ? mutual respect is the essence of        \n         our group. We never pushed for being elite, as we do not believe      \n         that any of us deserve the mark of the elitists. Every member         \n         of our group is taught to honor the next guy or gal with the          \n         same respect as he or her demands for themselves. The same            \n         thought applies to how we look at other groups.                       \n                                                                               \n         Are you ready to become part of a family? Do you think you have       \n         what it takes? Then now is the time to get up and contact us.         \n         Perhaps you will find a new road to follow with us. Open              \n         positions are as follows, but if you do feel you have something       \n         to contribute with but feel that it doesn?t match any of the          \n         open positions, then do contact us and let us be the judge            \n         of that.                                                              \n                                                                               \n         CRACKERS                                                              \n         Do you have a thrill to find solutions to various protection          \n         schemes? May it be unpacking, patching, finding algorithms            \n         or emulating? We?re always open for individuals that want to          \n         expand their knowledge in reversing. You are required to have         \n         some former knowledge in reversing as we do not tutor people          \n         from scratch. Former experience from other scene groups is            \n         good, but not a necessity. Unsure if you qualify? Contact us,         \n         and we?ll decide based on your qualities. Be prepared that            \n         we will demand examples of previous work.                             \n                                                                               \n         CODERS                                                                \n         You?re enthusiastic about coding, you love to optimize and            \n         integrate various projects; we always have projects ranging           \n         from smaller ones to large ones that are in need of attendance.       \n         If you are joining our family as a coder you will be appointed        \n         a variety of projects that will push you to do your best and          \n         will probably also serve as a great way of becoming an even           \n         greater coder. Projects are ranging from database integrations,       \n         IRC bots, and cracktros to tools and security oriented                \n         development. Examples of previous work will be required and           \n         experience beyond 2 years is also a requirement.                      \n                                                                               \n         SUPPLIERS                                                             \n         Do you have access to good titles?

Then          \n         feel free to contact us and let us know what you have. We do          \n         not focus on anything in particular and as such you will find         \n         that we do titles ranging from CAD/CAM to more common graphics,       \n         music and programming titles ? as well as ordinary shareware          \n         titles. Contact us today and we will see if your titles are           \n         something we?d like to put some effort into.                          \n                                                                               \n         SITES                                                                 \n         You?ve been running a dedicated and well supported site for           \n         more than 6 months, the site has grown some reputation and your       \n         staff as well as the chosen link location is security oriented.       \n         We do not accept sites that are running of rented boxes;              \n         neither do we accept sites located in United States of America,       \n         Germany or Austria.

Please do respect our stance           \n         on this and make sure that you buy the required licenses upon         \n         deciding to buy the product. Respect the software authors             \n         that have put time, money and effort into creating the title          \n         you now have in your hand.                                            \n                                                                               \n             1. You should only use this title for the period of time          \n                as you decide if this is the right product for you             \n                personally or for your business. Upon deciding                 \n                that this is the product you are looking for then              \n                we encourage you to buy the necessary licenses.                \n                                                                               \n             2.

This is convenient if you              \n                own a large set of various titles that all require             \n                dongles to run and you keep on mixing up the dongles.          \n                Our releases have removed those checks and thus will           \n                be more convenient to use. Again, this should only             \n                be the case if you own the required licenses.                  \n                                                                               \n             3.
