Problem is there's no romance in her own life. All that changes when she falls for Ben Reynolds, author of the new book, 'Wedding Day Do's and Don'ts.&quot; Unfortunately, their blossoming romance is threatened when she discovers that Ben's book is a primer for getting married on the cheap -- completely incompatible with everything she believes. Sparks fly at a wedding expo where Libby and Ben battle over clients. But when Libby's livelihood is threatened, Ben finds a creative way to come to her rescue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01215a06605e320db91972803ea9a96b8eec4cc0","amp;dn":"Ms.Matched.2016.HDTV.x264-TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01215a06605e320db91972803ea9a96b8eec4cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,33,90,6,96,94,50,13,185,25,114,128,62,169,169,107,142,236,76,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
