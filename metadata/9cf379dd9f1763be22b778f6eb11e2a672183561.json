Over four days, Tony heads out from the Victorian wool capital of Bradford and treks in a giant loop around what is now known as Bronte Country. From the birth of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and their brother Branwell in the suburb of Thornton, he traces their childhoods to the much-romanticised Bronte hub of Haworth, finding that the harsh reality of 1820s life was far removed both from the fantasy world dreamed up by the children at their father's parsonage home.\n\n2)  Victoria and Alberts Highland Fling \nTony Robinson visits the Cairngorms National Park to discover how Queen Victoria and Prince Albert helped shape Scottish traditions and imagery, such as tartan, bagpipes and caber-tossing. Starting in Pitlochry, he traverses the Killiecrankie Pass, where the Jacobites won the Battle of Killiecrankie, and ends his trek at Balmoral and the fantasy castle Albert built as his and Victoria's Highland escape.\n\n3)  Norman Conquest of Pembrokeshire \nTony heads to the south-west corner of Wales and one of Britain's finest coastal paths to find out why Pembrokeshire feels so English, even though it's more than 100 miles from the border. With its numerous castles and a fine cathedral, there are sure signs the Normans stamped their mark over the area. Tony's four-day walk traces the story of their conquest of the county, which he discovers was very different from the knockout victory at Hastings, involving a long, fiercely fought struggle.\n\n4)  Nazi Occupation Channel Islands \nTony heads to Guernsey and Jersey to tell the story of the islands' surrender to the Nazis during the Second World War. In Guernsey, he hears of the first bombing raid that heralded the German troops' arrival and sees the spot where the first-ever British commando landed in secret, only to see the planned revenge raid fail spectacularly. A ferry then takes him on to Jersey, where he finds almost all of its beaches have a bunker or a machine gun post left over from the conflict.\n\n5)  King Johns Ruin Peak District \nAs the 800th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta approaches next year, Tony Robinson sets out to discover the real King John. His walk across the medieval monarch's stamping grounds of Sherwood Forest and the Peak District reveals a hapless man stumbling from crisis to crisis who, in the end, had no choice but to sign away some of his power. In the midst of what are now cultivated fields, Tony finds the scant remains of Laxton Castle, once the control centre where strict `forest law' was administered and where taxes and fines flooded into the royal coffers. Later, in Sherwood, he explores how the myth of Robin Hood has helped to skew the public's image of King John.\n\n6)  Englands Last Battle West Country \nTony Robinson hikes up from Lyme Regis on Dorset's Jurassic Coast to the Somerset Levels in the footsteps of a ragtag rebel army led by the young Duke of Monmouth, the illegitimate son of Charles II. He sailed in from Holland around Lyme's famous Cobb with a handful of soldiers, believing the people would support him in overthrowing the newly crowned James II, who was also Monmouth's uncle, but, more importantly, Roman Catholic. The year was 1685 and the country was riven by anti-Catholic feeling mixed up with revolutionary zeal. Monmouth marched through the fiercely independent towns of Devon, gathering support from artisans and farmworkers. Meeting up with Billy Bragg in Colyton, Tony learns about the kind of people prepared to risk their lives for the Monmouth Rebellion.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nclick on the links below to get full-size images &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/8d3ae8e94904ff6f851f73101684089fffccaa5b.jpg&quot;
