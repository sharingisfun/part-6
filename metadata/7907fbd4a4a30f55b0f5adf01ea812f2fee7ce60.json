It is about fascinating and fun mathematical ideas you seldom encounter in school. Via Penrose, they are presented in an easy way for kids to understand.\nPenrose learns the truth about infinityFor example, you get to encounter 0s and 1s (binary numbers), fractals, infinity, Mobious strip, Pascal triangle, golden rectangles, paperfolding, tessellations, abacus, magic squares, tangrams, nanoworld... For math geeks, these are familiar topics. They show some of the beautiful, fun, and intriguing aspects of math.\nEach chapter spans about four pages, has a short storyline, and often a problem or challenge in the end. Answers are included in the end of the book. The mathematical content is suitable for about grades 3-9, but even younger kids can enjoy some of it.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/cnaormtxz/Pappas.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/cnaormtxz/Pappas.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nTheoni Pappas is committed to giving mathematics greater exposure and making it more approachable. Currently, Pappas is a mathematics educator and consultant. She received her B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley and her M.A. from Stanford University. She became a member of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) in 1967, when she began teaching high school mathematics. Over the years, she has taught basic math, prealgebra, algebra, trigonometry, geometry, precalculus, and calculus.
