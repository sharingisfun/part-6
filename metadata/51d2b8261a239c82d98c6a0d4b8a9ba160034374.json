A similar eclecticism and scope also surfaced in his solo work, which couched his charmingly gravelly voice in a rustic yet rich swamp pop fusion of country, blues, and gospel. Born Claude Russell Bridges on April 2, 1942, in Lawton, OK, he began studying classical piano at age three, a decade later adopting the trumpet and forming his first band. At 14, Russell lied about his age to land a gig at a Tulsa nightclub, playing behind Ronnie Hawkins &amp; the Hawks before touring in support of Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, he settled in Los Angeles, studying guitar under the legendary James Burton and appearing on sessions with Dorsey Burnette and Glen Campbell. As a member of Spector's renowned studio group, Russell played on many of the finest pop singles of the 1960s, also arranging classics like Ike &amp; Tina Turner's monumental &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;; other hits bearing his input include the Byrds' &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys' &quot;This Diamond Ring,&quot; and Herb Alpert's &quot;A Taste of Honey.&quot; ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nLeon Russell never quite hit all the right notes the way he did on his eponymous debut. He never again seemed as convincing in his grasp of Americana music and themes, never again seemed as individual, and never again did his limited, slurred bluesy voice seem as ingratiating. He never again topped his triptych of &quot;A Song for You,&quot; &quot;Hummingbird,&quot; and &quot;Delta Lady,&quot; nor did his albums contain such fine tracks as &quot;Dixie Lullaby.&quot; Throughout it all, what comes across is Russell's idiosyncratic vision, not only in his approach but in his very construction -- none of the songs quite play out as expected, turning country, blues, and rock inside out, not only musically but lyrically. Yes, his voice is a bit of an acquired taste, but it's only appropriate for a songwriter with enough chutzpah to write songs of his own called &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; And if there ever was a place to acquire a taste for Russell, it's here.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
