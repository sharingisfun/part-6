But some people were unhappy with its design. Windows 8.1 answers these complaints and takes Windows a step further. In this course, David Rivers shows you all its essential features. Take a tour of the interface, review the new file and folder behaviors, and meet the most useful apps, including Calendar, Photos, Maps, and Music. David also shows how to adjust system settings like default programs and volume, work with external devices, and set up networks. The final chapters show you how to keep your computer even more secure with Access Control and Windows Defender, and how to troubleshoot potential issues, like reversing fatal crashes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a14b13a15dc76ca6f56d76b48c5aaad20b6053","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Windows+8.1+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a14b13a15dc76ca6f56d76b48c5aaad20b6053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,161,75,19,161,93,199,108,166,245,109,118,180,140,90,170,210,11,96,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
