With their initial records, the group crossed the bridge between punk/new wave and Top 40 pop more than any other band, recording a series of hard, spiky singles that were also melodic and immediately accessible. Hynde was an invigorating, sexy singer who bent the traditional male roles of rock &amp; roll to her own liking, while guitarist James Honeyman-Scott created a sonic palette filled with suspended chords, effects pedals, and syncopated rhythms that proved remarkably influential over the next two decades. After Honeyman-Scott's death, the Pretenders became a more straightforward rock band, yet Hynde's semi-autobiographical songwriting and bracing determination meant that the group never became just another rock band, even when their music became smoother and more pop-oriented.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff1533174370b18f6f1f5974a2e8280c3e9d6ae","amp;dn":"The+Pretenders+-+The+Singles+%5Brock%5D+-+1987+%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff1533174370b18f6f1f5974a2e8280c3e9d6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,241,83,49,116,55,11,24,246,241,245,151,74,46,130,128,195,233,214,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
