Despite this being a live album, it does not represent a single full concert. Instead, it was recorded at different venues across Europe just before and on the Fear of the Dark World Tour.\n\nThis album is a compilation of A Real Dead One and A Real Live One, which were re-released with all the other Iron Maiden albums in 1998.\n\nReal Live Tour was the tour supporting the album.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Bruce Dickinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n    * Dave Murray ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n    * Janick Gers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n    * Steve Harris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\n    * Nicko McBrain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\nwith\n\n    * Michael Kenney - keyboard\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10060e14e42161c2bb8a469cc5fe628815a78f2e","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%5C%27A+Real+Live+Dead+One%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10060e14e42161c2bb8a469cc5fe628815a78f2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,6,14,20,228,33,97,194,187,138,70,156,197,254,98,136,21,167,143,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
