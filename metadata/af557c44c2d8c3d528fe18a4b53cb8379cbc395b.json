Players are now able to build drone ships and control them without being inside the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cockpit - keep in mind that remote control is still dependent on the friendly antennasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ signal. Moreover, the timer block has been added, which allows players to trigger a queued action after a set period of time. Additionally, gravity and sensor field view are also available and sensors can detect stations/platforms.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Remote ship control Ã¢â‚¬â€œ control ships without being inside the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cockpit (drones)\n- Timer block - triggers a queued action after a set period of time\n- Gravity/Sensor field view\n- Sensor block now detects stations\n- Ore detector info can be relayed through antennas\n- New interior wall texture\n \nFixes:\n- fixed cost of small ship piston head (it cost the same as a large ship piston head)\n- fixed issue when placing a landing gear or station block was placed as fully built\n- fixed dedicated servers downloading blank/empty .sbms\n- fixed unmerging/merging breaks control groups\n- fixed several MODs which were crashing dedicated server\n- fixed connectors being destroyed because they were too close while connected\n- fixed piston disappearing after grinding down the top part\n- fixed sensor detecting players while being set to detect floating objects\n \nKnown issues:\n- Sensor block is detecting small ships, but the action is not triggered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af557c44c2d8c3d528fe18a4b53cb8379cbc395b","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.047.017+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af557c44c2d8c3d528fe18a4b53cb8379cbc395b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,85,124,68,194,216,195,213,40,254,24,164,181,60,184,55,156,188,57,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
