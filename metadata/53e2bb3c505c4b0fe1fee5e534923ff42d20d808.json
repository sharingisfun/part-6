In the opening narration he states he &quot;was here before with the 5th US Army&quot; in World War II. In Naples, Michael discovers that his brother had a son, nine-year-old Nando, who is being cared for by his maternal aunt Lucia (Loren), a cabaret singer. Joseph never married Nando's mother but drowned with her in a boating accident. Joseph's actual wife, whom he left in 1950, is alive in Philadelphia. Michael discovers to his dismay that his brother spent a fortune on fireworks. After seeing Nando handing out racy photos of Lucia at 2 A.M., Michael wants to enroll Nando in the American School at Rome, but Lucia wins custody of the boy. Despite the age difference, romance soon blossoms between Michael and Lucia, and he decides to stay in Italy.\n\nWhen American lawyer Michael Hamilton (Clark Gable) hears that his estranged younger brother and sister-in-law have died in a car accident, he flies to Naples, Italy, to settle their estate. Upon arriving, the xenophobic Hamilton meets his impish nephew, Nando (Marietto), for the first time, and decides he will bring the boy back with him to the United States. But when Nando's gorgeous aunt, Lucia Curcio (Sophia Loren), protests, a lengthy and heated custody battle ensues.\n\nThis was the last film to be released within Gable's lifetime (his final film, The Misfits, was released posthumously) and his last film in color. One of the highlights of the film is a tongue-in-cheek musical number by Loren called &quot;Tu vuÃƒÂ² fÃƒÂ  l'americano&quot; (You Want To Be Americano) written by famed Neapolitan composer Renato Carosone.\n\nFilmed on location in Rome, Naples and Capri, It Started in Naples was nominated for an Academy Award for its art direction (Hal Pereira, Roland Anderson, Samuel M. Comer, Arrigo Breschi).\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 778 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x368\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 100 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e2bb3c505c4b0fe1fee5e534923ff42d20d808","amp;dn":"It+Started+in+Naples+%281960%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Sophia+Loren%2C+Clark+Gable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e2bb3c505c4b0fe1fee5e534923ff42d20d808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,226,187,60,80,92,75,15,225,254,229,229,52,146,63,244,45,32,216,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
