It was released as a single and provided the band's only number-one hit in the UK, the US, West Germany and many other countries. In the UK, it was their first single since 1968's &quot;Point Me at the Sky&quot;. For Part II, Pink Floyd received a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by a Rock Duo or Group and lost to Bob Seger's &quot;Against the Wind&quot;. In addition, Part II was #375 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.\n\nIn 1980, the song was adopted as a protest anthem by black students during the &quot;Elsie's River&quot; uprising in South Africa, protesting against the racial propaganda and bias in the official curriculum. On May 2nd, it was banned by the government.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6226aef38569451cbabae9a74f1042a387e0ebb","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Another+Brick+In+The+Wall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6226aef38569451cbabae9a74f1042a387e0ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,34,106,239,56,86,148,81,203,171,174,154,116,241,4,42,56,126,14,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
