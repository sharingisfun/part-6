Please keep in mind many of these ebooks have never been officially sold as such, so the quality isn't always the best. 4 of them are children's picture books (the K9 quartet), which I have also included pdf copies for.\n\nBernice Summerfield\n\nThe character of Professor Bernice Summerfield Ã¢â‚¬â€ a hard-drinking, wise-cracking archaeologist Ã¢â‚¬â€ originally appeared as a companion to the Doctor in the 1992 New Adventure novel Love and War by Paul Cornell. Bernice (Benny to her friends) proved an immediate hit with fans, and went on to appear in over 60 subsequent New Adventures, eventually becoming the star of the books after Virgin lost the rights to publish Doctor Who fiction in 1997.\n\nMissing Adventures\n\nThe Missing Adventures were a monthly series of novels from Virgin Books, featuring past Doctors and companions Ã¢â‚¬â€ original stories, never seen on TV. The first MA appeared in July 1994, and they were published on a monthly basis until May 1997, when Virgin's licence to publish Doctor Who fiction expired.\n\nThe MAs mostly starred one of the first 6 Doctors (the Seventh Doctor featured in the New Adventures instead), alongside established television companions. There were even occasional appearances from old enemies Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Cybermen, Sontarans, Yeti, Ice Warriors, Silurians, Ogrons and the Master all featured in various books.\n\nNew Adventures\n\nThe first New Adventures novels were published by Virgin Books in 1991. Featuring the Seventh Doctor, they carried on the Time Lord's story from the point where the classic TV series ended in 1989, and were revolutionary at the time as being the first ongoing series of original Doctor Who novels (i.e. not based on TV episodes) Ã¢â‚¬â€ a template which has since become the norm for Who fiction.\n\nFrom the beginning, the New Adventures also consciously strove to break the mould of &quot;typical&quot; Doctor Who stories, and while several established villains appeared (Cybermen, Ice Warriors, the Master, etc.), the overall tone of the NAs was more edgy and provocative than previous Who novelisations. This led to controversy in some quarters, but most of the time this fresh approach was well-received by fans and the range overall was very successful.\n\nNew Series Adventures\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the last few years, you'll be well aware that Doctor Who finally returned to our TV screens in 2005, initially starring Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, then subsequently David Tennant and Matt Smith as the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors respectively.\n\nTo tie in with the new series, BBC Books currently publish a series of spin-off books. Though rather than being novelisations of the new TV stories, these are all original novels.\n\nHowever, they differ from the BBC's previous 8th Doctor and past Doctor novels in a couple of ways: Mainly that they are being aimed at a family audience, much like the TV series itself. The BBC have pointed out that this doesn't mean they are &quot;kid's&quot; books, just that the novels will hold back from the occasional mature references which the previous novels have been able to include.\n\nShort Trips\n\nThe Short Trips series: Initially three volumes of short stories published by the BBC between 1998 and 2000. These proved popular with fans, but for some reason the BBC declined to publish any more, allowing Big Finish to step into the breach and licence use of the name Ã¢â‚¬â€ they published 29 such short story volumes, starting in 2002 and ending in early 2009.\n\nPast Doctors\n\nIn May 1997, Virgin's licence to publish Doctor Who fiction reverted to the BBC, who henceforth began publishing two series of original novels, one featuring Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor, and a &quot;past Doctor&quot; range, featuring the previous seven Doctors.\n\nThe past Doctor range continued steadily for several years until 2005, when two things happened. First, publication of the range was paused in the first half of the year, around the launch of the new series (and its attendant range of new series novels). Then, at the end of 2005, the BBC put off announcing any further novels in the range (i.e. focussing solely on the new series novels).\n\nSo the past Doctor novels are currently in hiatus, much as the classic series was after 1989 Ã¢â‚¬â€ with neither an official report of cancellation, nor any announced plans for new novels.\n\nTarget Novelizations\n\nThe first print adaptation of a Doctor Who television story (The Daleks by David Whitaker) was released in 1964 by Frederick Muller Publishing. In 1973, Target Books, a division of the W.H. Allen publishing house, secured rights to reprint this and two other 60s novels, and thereafter started commissioning and publishing new Who novelisations, beginning a successful range that would continue for over 20 years and see more than 13 million books sold worldwide.\n\nIn the late 80s, Target/W.H. Allen were taken over by Virgin Publishing, but the release of new novelisations (and reprinting of old ones) continued until the supply of available &quot;classic series&quot; stories finally ran dry in 1994.\n\nThe 8th Doctor\n\nIn May 1997, Virgin's licence to publish Doctor Who fiction reverted to the BBC, who henceforth began publishing two ranges of original novels, one featuring Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor and one featuring the past seven Doctors. Unlike the standalone &quot;past Doctor&quot; novels, the 8th Doctor novels were written as a more-or-less continuous &quot;series&quot; of adventures, much like Virgin's New Adventures.\n\nThis series continued until June 2005, when it was halted to make way for the new TV series and its corresponding range of new series novels.\n\nThe 8th Doctor books featured a series of new companions for the Doctor, such as Samantha Jones (a rebellious English teenager), Fitz Kreiner (a roguish dreamer from the 1960s) and others. Established enemies also popped up from time to time, including the Daleks, the Zygons, the Master and more.\n\nTorchwood\n\nSince early 2007, BBC Books have published a regular series of original novels based on the popular Doctor Who spin-off TV series Torchwood, which as most of you know debuted on the BBC in late 2006. Since then a batch of 3 novels has appeared once or twice a year (apart from 2010 and 2012, due to the lack of new episodes in those years).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762d75915062dcc90ed7075645280e3d4f619cd4","amp;dn":"567+Doctor+Who+eBooks+%28epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762d75915062dcc90ed7075645280e3d4f619cd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,45,117,145,80,98,220,201,14,215,7,86,69,40,14,61,79,97,156,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
