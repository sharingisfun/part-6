Bronzino, Donald R. Peterson (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4398-2531-0\r\n\r\nKnown as the bible of biomedical engineering, The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, Fourth Edition, sets the standard against which all other references of this nature are measured. As such, it has served as a major resource for both skilled professionals and novices to biomedical engineering.\r\n\r\nMolecular, Cellular, and Tissue Engineering, the fourth volume of the handbook, presents material from respected scientists with diverse backgrounds in molecular biology, transport phenomena, physiological modeling, tissue engineering, stem cells, drug delivery systems, artificial organs, and personalized medicine.\r\n\r\nMore than three dozen specific topics are examined, including DNA vaccines, biomimetic systems, cardiovascular dynamics, biomaterial scaffolds, cell mechanobiology, synthetic biomaterials, pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, nanobiomaterials for tissue engineering, biomedical imaging of engineered tissues, gene therapy, noninvasive targeted protein and peptide drug delivery, cardiac valve prostheses, blood substitutes, artificial skin, molecular diagnostics in personalized medicine, and bioethics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505674cda1ad2e360b7e58dfa8a500436dc74d96","amp;dn":"Molecular%2C+Cellular%2C+and+Tissue+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505674cda1ad2e360b7e58dfa8a500436dc74d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,86,116,205,161,173,46,54,11,126,88,223,168,165,0,67,109,199,77,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
