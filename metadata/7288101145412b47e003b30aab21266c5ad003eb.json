The state-of-the-art Capitol studios were capable of producing a more detailed sound, which gave Nelson Riddle more freedom in his arrangements and orchestrations.\n\n\n Songs for Young Lovers was the first album Frank Sinatra recorded for Capitol, as well as his first collaboration with Nelson Riddle. It was also one of the first -- arguably the very first -- concept album. Sinatra, Riddle, and producer Voyle Gilmore decided that the new album format should be a special event, featuring a number of songs arranged around a specific theme; in addition, the new format was capable of producing a more detailed sound, which gave Riddle more freedom in his arrangements and orchestrations. Songs for Young Lovers is a perfect example of this. Supported by a small orchestra, Sinatra and Riddle create an intimate, romantic atmosphere on the record, breathing new life into standards like &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;They Can't Take That Away from Me,&quot; &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You,&quot; and &quot;A Foggy Day.&quot; There is a breezy confidence to Sinatra's singing, and Riddle's arrangements are more complex than they initially appear.
