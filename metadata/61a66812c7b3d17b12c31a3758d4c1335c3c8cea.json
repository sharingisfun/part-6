It can then adjust the \n\nmp3 files so that they all have the same loudness \n\nwithout any quality loss. This way, you don't have \n\nto keep reaching for the volume dial on your mp3 \n\nplayer every time it switches to a new song. \nMP3Gain operates in two modes, Track and Album: \n\nTrack mode volume-corrects a mix of unrelated songs \n\nto a selected level. MP3Gain calculates the volume \n\nlevel for each song individually. It then corrects \n\neach song to make its volume level match the Target \n\nVolume. \n\nFor example, if you have 3 songs that have volume \n\nlevels of 86, 91 and 89 dB and you use Track Gain \n\nto convert them to a Target Volume of 92 dB, they \n\nwill all be at approximately 92 dB.\n\n\n\n\n\n                =\n        =         =\n                    =\n       = =  ======   = =\n      =   =         =   =\n       = =           = = \n..............................by: tsopperas!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tsopperas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tsopperas&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a66812c7b3d17b12c31a3758d4c1335c3c8cea","amp;dn":"MP3Gain+Portable+multilanguage.+by+tsopperas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a66812c7b3d17b12c31a3758d4c1335c3c8cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,166,104,18,199,179,209,123,18,195,26,55,88,212,193,51,92,60,140,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
