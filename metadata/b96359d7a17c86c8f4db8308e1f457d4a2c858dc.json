Avenue puts all your media and effects right at your fingertips, so you can quickly play and improvise your live visuals.\t\r\n\r\nScreen Warping &amp; Video Mapping Arena\r\nIn the advanced output window you can now create as many slices from your composition and position and transform them to your liking. This is perfect for projection mapping on many surfaces. Your surfaces do not have to be rectangular anymore either, you can warp your video onto curved screens with the advanced bezier transformations.\r\n\r\nGenerative Content\r\nResolume plays all your interactive Quartz Composition and Flash animations including AS2 and AS3 scripting. Use it to display text input from Resolume and with parameters you can gain even more control over your animations and tweak your content while VJ-ing. Watch the Resolume &amp; Flash Video. Watch the Quartz Composer Video. If you're feeling really adventurous your can even code your own generative content in openGL by compiling FFGL source plugins. \r\n\r\nOther New Features in Resolume 4\r\nâ€¢ You configure every layer to automatically start the first clip when the composition has loaded.
