Though she proffered the idea to her primary publisher, and though the idea floated around their office for years, ultimately the project was not undertaken. In one of the publisher's letters that seemed promising, Elizabeth had written an exclamation of joy in the margins, and it seems fitting to us to fulfill her wish for a garter stitch book. As we looked through Elizabeth's designs, we found a wealth of material, much of it little known or unknown to knitters. Further, we were intrigued and excited by the unique construction of some of these &quot;new&quot;; designs (equal to her classic baby surprise jacket). You will find sweaters, coats, jackets, and vests for adults and kids, baby garments, plus a wonderful array of small projects including sideways gloves and socks, several brimmed hats, an ingenious pattern for knitted clogs and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e419fa29aebdc5021692e3b837d9a52acff830","amp;dn":"Knit+One+Knit+All+-+Elizabeth+Zimmerman%27s+Garter+Stitch+Designs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e419fa29aebdc5021692e3b837d9a52acff830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,228,25,250,41,174,189,197,2,22,146,227,184,55,217,165,42,207,248,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
