In his fantasy world, the Dark One, the embodiment of pure evil, is breaking free from his prison. The overall plot is about a man who learns that he is the reincarnation of the world's messiah and is once again destined to save the world from the Dark One -- but possibly destroy it in the process. This saga is not only his story, but the story of an entire world's struggle to deal with war and change, destruction and hope.\n\n\nThe Strike At Shayol Ghul (Wheel of Time, #0.1) by Robert Jordan (2010)\n\nNew Spring (Wheel of Time, #0.2) by Robert Jordan (2004)\n\nThe Eye of the World (Wheel of Time, #1) by Robert Jordan (1990)\n\nThe Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2) by Robert Jordan (1990)\n\nThe Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3) by Robert Jordan (1991)\n\nThe Shadow Rising (Wheel of Time, #4) by Robert Jordan (1992)\n\nThe Fires of Heaven (Wheel of Time, #5) by Robert Jordan (1993)\n\nLord of Chaos (Wheel of Time, #6) by Robert Jordan (1994)\n\nA Crown of Swords (Wheel of Time, #7) by Robert Jordan (1996)\n\nThe Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time, # by Robert Jordan (1998)\n\nWinter's Heart (Wheel of Time, #9) by Robert Jordan (2000)\n\nCrossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, #10) by Robert Jordan (2002)\n\nKnife of Dreams (Wheel of Time, #11) by Robert Jordan (2005)\n\nThe Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12) by Robert Jordan (2009)\n\nTowers of Midnight (Wheel of Time, #13) by Robert Jordan (2010)\n\nA Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, #14) by Robert Jordan (2013)\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31bfd40ec4a2523296b8cfb5505d8f221123f4e","amp;dn":"Wheel+of+Time+Series+%280.1-14%29+by+Robert+Jordan+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31bfd40ec4a2523296b8cfb5505d8f221123f4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,27,253,64,236,74,37,35,41,107,140,251,85,5,216,242,33,18,63,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
