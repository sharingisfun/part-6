The new three-parterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which premieres in the U.S. in April on MASTERPIECE on PBSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½takes up the story in 1936, a bumpy year in British history. Parlormaid Rose finds herself back at 165 Eaton Place serving as housekeeper to its new owners: Sir Hallam Holland (Ed StoppardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½yes Tom StoppardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes, MI-5, Wives &amp; Daughters). Reprising her role as Rose is co-creator Jean Marsh (Sense &amp; Sensibility), who won an Emmy for her work in the original series. This time around series co-creator Dame Eileen Atkins (Cranford, Gosford Park) also has an onscreen part to play: as HallamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formidable mother, Maud. Per Radio Times, even Wallis Simpson will swan through the action. Fingers crossed that BBC will commission more.\n\n\n1 :01x01 - The Fledgling (Dec/26/2010)\nThe year is 1936 and Sir Hallam Holland and his wife Lady Agnes move into the iconic townhouse. Former parlourmaid Rose Buck helps them adjust to their new surroundings. The builders work to return the house to it's former opulence. Lady Agnes and Sir Hallam are surprised when his mother, Maud, arrives from India and reveals that she intends to move in as well.\n\n2 :01x02 - The Ladybird (Dec/27/2010)\nIt is now June 1936 and Rose is now the offical housekeeper. Lady Agnes has managed to manoeuvre her household to the heart of London society and loves the fact that Lady Persie is a debutante. Lady Persie is bored though as is Maud.\n\n3 :01x03 - The Cuckoo (Dec/28/2010)\nIt has now moved onto November 1936 and it is several weeks since the Cable Street riots and the following tragedy. Sir Hallam feels that he is responsible for Lotte's plight and the staff are worried about her future. Lady Persie's life becomes very complex. Lady Agnes who is due to give birth in December, has no idea what her sister has been up to.\n\nhdtv_xvid-fov/624x352/25fps/1.1Mbps/01:00:47\nmp3/128Kbps/48KHz/Stereo/549MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1782352/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1782352/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc948f17200e23f509bdf8146886f0d22f3370d","amp;dn":"Upstairs%2C+Downstairs++%28BBC+2010+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc948f17200e23f509bdf8146886f0d22f3370d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,201,72,241,114,0,226,63,80,155,223,129,70,136,111,13,34,243,55,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
