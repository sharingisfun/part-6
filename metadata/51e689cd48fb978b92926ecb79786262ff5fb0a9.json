It was released with 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966 (The Red Album), which covered their earlier period. 1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1970 made #1 on the U.S. Billboard chart and #2 on the U.K. Album Chart. This album was re-released in September 1993 charting at #4 in the UK. The cover art shows the band once again looking down the stairwell of EMI's Manchester Square headquarters in London; the same pose, camera angle, setting and photographer (Angus McBean) as used for the cover on the Please Please Me and 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966 albums, which used different photos from the same photo session. The image was originally shot for the Get Back album, which later became Let It Be, but in the end the photograph was not used for that project. The album was compiled by Beatles manager Allen Klein, with his selections approved by the Beatles themselves.[1] Songs performed by the Beatles as solo artists were also considered for inclusion, but like the cover songs on 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966, limited space resulted in this idea having to be abandoned. As with the 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966, this compilation was produced by Apple/EMI at least partially in response to a bootleg collection titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year.\n\nBruce Eder, All Music Guide - Picking up where 1962-1966 left off, the double-album compilation 1967-1970, commonly called The Blue Album, covers the Beatles' later records, from Sgt. Pepper's through Let It Be. Like The Red Album, The Blue Album was released in the wake of a pair of widely advertised quadruple-LP bootlegs, Alpha Omega, Vols. 1-2: The Story of the Beatles, which had appeared early in 1973. And like its companion volume, this set contains a mixture of hits, including singles like &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; -- which had originally appeared only as 45s -- plus important album tracks like &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,&quot; &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; and &quot;Come Together,&quot; as well as orphaned tracks such as the single versions of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Get Back,&quot; which had never been on any LP before. The first two sides of the original double-LP edition carry listeners through the highlights of the psychedelic era, starting with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and up through &quot;Magical Mystery Tour,&quot; before returning to rock &amp; roll territory on &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and &quot;Revolution.&quot; The second LP skims three of the more popular tracks off of the sprawling White Album (aka The Beatles) and moves into the late singles (&quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&quot; &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; &quot;Let It Be&quot;), plus single and album highlights from Abbey Road and Let It Be. As a prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cis of the group's final 36 months, it's all mightily impressive, even if 1967-1970 misses several great songs. But like its predecessor, this set does capture the essence (if not the full range) of the Beatles' later recordings. Note: The 1993 CD reissue of this and its companion volume featured some modest upgrades of some of the masters that overlapped with the 1988 Past Masters, Vol. 1 and Past Masters, Vol. 2. \n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Strawberry Fields Forever\n[02] Penny Lane\n[03] Sgt.
