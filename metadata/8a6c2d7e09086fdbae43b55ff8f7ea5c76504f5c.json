The finale episode, 'The Parting of the Ways', was broadcast on 18 June\n2005.\n\nThe show depicts the adventures of a mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as\nthe Doctor, who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS,\nwhich normally appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s-ish British police box.\nWith his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves\ncivilizations, helping people and righting wrongs. The first series features\nChristopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, his only series as\nthe Doctor, accompanied by Billie Piper, as his first and main companion Rose\nTyler, whom he plucks from obscurity on planet Earth, and to whom he grows\nincreasingly attached. He also travels briefly with unruly boy-genius Adam\nMitchell, played by Bruno Langley, and with 51st-century con man and former 'Time\nAgent' Captain Jack Harkness, portrayed by John Barrowman. Episodes in series one\nform a loose story arc, based upon the recurring phrase &quot;Bad Wolf&quot;, the\nsignificance of which goes unexplained until the two-part series finale.\n\n\nTotal Episodes: 13\nTotal Specials: 03\n\n\nSynopses courtesy of: The On-line TV Database\n                      An Open Database for Television Fans\n                      (www.thetvdb.com)\n\n\n2005-03-26 - Rose (Video: 640x368, 1000kbps, 24fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 112kbps)\n\nLocation: London, England - Date: 4th/5th/6th March 2005 - Enemy: Nestene Consciousness - Rose Tyler stumbles across a man called The Doctor as he seeks out the Nestene Consciousness, to prevent the living plastic it is controlling from taking over the world.\n\n\n2005-04-02 - The End of the World (Video: 640x368, 1000kbps, 24fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 107kbps)\n\nLocation: Platform 1 (A space station orbiting Earth) - Date: 5,000,000,000 AD - \nEnemy: The Lady Cassandra - The Doctor takes Rose on her first voyage through time: to the year five billion, when the Sun is about to expand and swallow the Earth.
