It's a lot cosier so. \nEnd-credits removed (very annoying to hear the same tune again and again)\nbut the last episodes of each Season are kept. Saved at least 1GB.\nS1.ep 10 source got some weird error @ 19min 18 sec and had to cut out about 40 sec.\nNo subs after that. It's toward the end so won't &quot;hurt&quot; so much.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c591d6dda0d60a0e5c844f8da93530ab78c4489c","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+The+Clone+Wars+S1-S4+2008-2012+BDRip+1080p-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c591d6dda0d60a0e5c844f8da93530ab78c4489c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,145,214,221,160,214,10,14,92,132,79,141,169,53,48,171,120,196,72,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
