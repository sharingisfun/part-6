These are offered AS IS. I didn't create them, I have no idea if all of them work. I assume they don't have viruses, or the torrent threads above would be loaded with complaints. I'm sure anyone who can figure out the emulator would be greatly loved if they were to post decent instructions in the  comment section. For a list of the games - too long for the TPB space restrictions - just look at the links above. I'm cleaning old files out of my machine, so I thought I'd give these another chance to live before I delete them. Apparently, they run on an emulator called &quot;dosbox&quot;.\n\nQuestions? ask below. Maybe someone will answer them. I have no idea. Good luck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb891a01271a17852a8c8e76eb4d5669f08236e","amp;dn":"Old+PC+Games+%5BTorrent+Reload%5D+A-Z+-+3+Zip+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb891a01271a17852a8c8e76eb4d5669f08236e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,184,145,160,18,113,161,120,82,168,200,231,110,180,213,102,159,8,35,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
