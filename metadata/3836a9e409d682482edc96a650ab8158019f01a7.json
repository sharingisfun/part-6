In particular, companies often fail to ensure that the sensory quality of their products remains consistent. This leads to the sale of goods which fail to meet the company's desired specifications and are then rejected by the consumer. The contributors and editor have compiled a practical guide for all those tasked with using sensory analysis for quality control (QC) of food and beverages.\nContributions in the first sections cover the key aspects to consider when designing a sensory QC program and focus on methods for sensory QC and statistical data analysis. The third part reviews the use of sensory QC programs in the food and beverage industry and the application of sensory techniques for shelf-life assessment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3836a9e409d682482edc96a650ab8158019f01a7","amp;dn":"+Sensory+analysis+for+food+%2C+beverage+quality+control%3Apractical+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3836a9e409d682482edc96a650ab8158019f01a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,54,169,228,9,214,130,72,46,220,150,166,80,171,129,88,1,159,1,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
