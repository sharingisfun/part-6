It starred Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster and Yvonne De Carlo as his wife, Lily Munster\n\nThose creepy-but-lovable residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane are on deck for 38 hilarious half-hours during season one of The Munsters. Seen throughout the season are Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster, a softhearted replica of the Frankenstein monster; Yvonne de Carlo as Herman's voluptuously vampirish wife, Lily; Al Lewis as Grandpa Munster, a 350-year-old Dracula clone who spends most of his time cooking up mischief in his laboratory; and Butch Patrick as Herman and Lily's young son, Eddie, a budding werewolf. During the season's first 13 episodes, Beverly Owen appears as the Munsters' beautiful niece Marilyn, the only normal-looking member of the family (though she thinks she's a homely freak). Thereafter, and throughout the rest of the series' run, Pat Priest is seen as Marilyn. Some of the season's funniest entries include &quot;Pink's Pique,&quot; in which the gas company is in for quite a shock when they accidentally build a pipeline in the Munsters' dungeon -- er, basement; &quot;Low-Cal Munster,&quot; featuring Paul Lynde as a nearsighted doctor who puts Herman on a diet (and who, fortunately for his own sanity, can't see what Herman really looks like!); &quot;Autumn Croakus,&quot; wherein Grandpa's nearly four-century lifespan may come to an end at the hands of a murderous widow; &quot;Herman the Great,&quot; with Herman becoming a pro wrestler to pay for Eddie's education; &quot;Eddie's Nickname,&quot; featuring a magical milk shake which, thanks to Grandpa's bungling, grows a thick beard; &quot;Far Out Munsters,&quot; a spoof of &quot;bizarre&quot; '60s rock &amp; roll groups featuring future softcore film producer Zalman King and The Standells; and &quot;Herman the Rookie,&quot; the one in which Herman gets a tryout with the Los Angeles Dodgers as manager Leo Durocher and former football star Elroy &quot;Crazylegs&quot; Hirsch look on with mouths agape.\n\n\n \n\n  The Munsters - Unaired Pilot Episode \n  The Munsters 101 Munster Masquerade \n  The Munsters 102 My Fair Munster \n  The Munsters 103 A Walk On The Mild Side \n  The Munsters 104 Rock-A-Bye Munster \n  The Munsters 105 Pikes Pique \n  The Munsters 106 Low-Cal Munster \n  The Munsters 107 Tin Can Man \n  The Munsters 108 Herman The Great \n  The Munsters 109 Knock Wood, Here Comes Charlie \n  The Munsters 110 Autumn Croakus \n  The Munsters 111 The Midnight Ride Of Herman Munster \n  The Munsters 112 The Sleeping Cutie \n  The Munsters 113 Family Portrait \n  The Munsters 114 Grandpa Leaves Home \n  The Munsters 115 Hermans Rival \n  The Munsters 116 Grandpas Call Of The Wild \n  The Munsters 117 All Star Munster \n  The Munsters 118 If A Martian Answers, Hang Up \n  The Munsters 119 Eddie\\'s Nickname \n  The Munsters 120 Bats Of A Feather \n  The Munsters 121 Dont Bank On Herman \n  The Munsters 122 Dance With Me, Herman \n  The Munsters 123 Follow That Munster \n  The Munsters 124 Love Locked Out \n  The Munsters 125 Come Back, Little Googie \n  The Munsters 126 Far Out Munsters \n  The Munsters 127 Munsters On The Move \n  The Munsters 128 Movie Star Munster \n  The Munsters 129 Herman The Rookie \n  The Munsters 130 Country Club Munsters \n  The Munsters 131 Love Comes To Mockingbird Heights \n  The Munsters 132 Mummy Munster \n  The Munsters 133 Lily Munster, Girl Model \n  The Munsters 134 Munster The Magnificent \n  The Munsters 135 Hermans Happy Valley \n  The Munsters 136 Hot Rod Herman \n  The Munsters 137 Hermans Raise \n  The Munsters 138 Yes, Galen, There Is A Herman\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHerman Munster - Fred Gwynne \nLily Munster - Yvonne De Carlo \nGrandpa - Al Lewis \nEddie Munster - Butch Patrick \nMarilyn Munster - Beverley Owen / Pat Priest \nThe Raven - Mel Blanc / Bob Hastings \nSpot - Spot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ea685aa9bfc36c64f3579a3ff82f305e72f81c","amp;dn":"The+Munsters+-+1964+-+Season+1+%28DvD%29+AVI+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ea685aa9bfc36c64f3579a3ff82f305e72f81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,234,104,90,169,191,195,108,100,243,87,154,63,248,47,48,94,114,248,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
