His turn to Marxism in the 1930s was partly due to the influence of Bertolt Brecht, whose critical aesthetics developed epic theatre and its Verfremdungseffekt (defamiliarisation, alienation). An earlier influence was friend Gershom Scholem, founder of the academic study of the Kabbalah and of Jewish mysticism.\n\nBenjamin committed suicide in Portbou at the FrenchÃ¢â‚¬â€œSpanish border while attempting to escape from the Nazis.\n\n\nAll of the following books (and one journal article) are in PDF format:\n\n* THE ARCADES PROJECT (Harvard University Press, 1999).
