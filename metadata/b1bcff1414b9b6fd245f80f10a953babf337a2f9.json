To celebrate the 40th\nanniversary of Deep Purple's groundbreaking double live album Made in Japan\nthis documentary explores these recordings and Deep Purple mark 2, the\nline-up between 1969 and 1973.\n\nThe film highlights the mark 2 period of this classic British rock band\nfeaturing the classic line-up of Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord\nRoger Glover and Ian Paice with a focus on the recording of the album\nMachine Head in Montreux, Switzerland in late 1971; the friction that\ndeveloped within the band as a result of this recording and their incessant\ntouring of the world in general and North America in particular; and the\nlive recordings of the band's first Japanese tour in August 1972, released\nthat December in the UK as Made in Japan, a Number 1 UK album. Lars Ulrich\nof Metallica has cited Made in Japan as his favourite album of all time.\n\nFeaturing previously unseen exclusive footage, this film promises to uncover\nthe meaning behind the song Smoke on the Water, known for one of the most\niconic riffs in rock history, and to reveal the background to the mystery\nthat lies behind the three nights in Osaka and Tokyo during the recording of\nthe live Made in Japan album from 1972.\n\nThis line-up of Deep Purple then split in 1973, with Gillan and then Glover\nquitting the band to be replaced. The classic mark 2 line-up would go on to\nreform twice more in the late 80s and early 90s and although Ritchie Blackmore\nleft the band for the last time in 1993 and despite the death of organist Jon\nLord in 2012, Deep Purple are very much active. Made in Japan has been ranked\nas the sixth best live album of all time, and this film goes under the covers\nto tell us why\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MKV\nCODEC:........................: X264\nFILE SIZE:....................: 447 MiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*406=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO MP2: ...................: 256 Kbps\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 10s\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bcff1414b9b6fd245f80f10a953babf337a2f9","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+in+Japan+x264+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bcff1414b9b6fd245f80f10a953babf337a2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,188,255,20,20,185,182,253,36,95,128,241,10,149,59,171,243,55,162,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
