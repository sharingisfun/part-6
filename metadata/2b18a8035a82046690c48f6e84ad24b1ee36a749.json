Van Der Horst (eds)\n\nPublisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Eerdmans Publishers 1998-10 | 960 Pages | ISBN: 9004111190 | PDF | 49 MB\n\n\n\n\nThis text presents a reference on the gods, angels, demons, spirits and semi-divine heroes whose names occur in the biblical books. This revised edition features 30 new entries, while more than 100 have been updated. \n\n\nThe text is arranged in order of the Latin alphabet and the more than 400 names are those found in the books of the Hebrew and Greek Bible, the Old and New Testament, including the Apocrypha. There are entries on divine names recognized as such by the biblical authors, divine names in theophoric toponyms and anthroponyms, secular terms which occur as divine names in neighbouring civilizations, conjectural divine names and humans who acquired a semi-divine status in tradition. \n\n\nA typical entry contains a discussion of the pertinent name, its meaning, the religio-historical background, relevant biblical passages and a bibliography. The book includes extensive indices and cross-references.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b18a8035a82046690c48f6e84ad24b1ee36a749","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons+in+the+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b18a8035a82046690c48f6e84ad24b1ee36a749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,24,168,3,90,130,4,102,144,196,143,110,132,173,36,177,238,54,167,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
