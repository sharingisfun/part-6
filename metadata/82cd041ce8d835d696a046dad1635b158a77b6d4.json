It is not the Factory Manual Honda dealer mechanics use.  It appears to be stuff collected from http://alldata.com , a company which sells proprietary information which should be open-source to independent mechanics via a subscription service.\n\nAlthough better than nothing, it's not a genuine Factory Service Manual.  I believe those are only available in paper for this model Honda.\n\nI purchased this information and now release it into the wild.  Why?  Because working people deserve this old car repair information because corporations have unfair legal advantages.  We have to fight back in every way possible.\n\nSuccessful wrenching is resistance to tyranny.  Keep up the Good Work.  from Charlie P.\n\n- ----------------------------\n61 Files, 234,619,389 bytes\n\n2003 Wiring.pdf\n2005 Fuses.pdf\n2006 Electrical Component Location.pdf\n2006 Wiring.pdf\n3.5l Engine.pdf\nAirbags.pdf\nAlternator.pdf\nAntilock Brakes.pdf\nAuto Transmission Overhaul.pdf\nAuto Transmission Service.pdf\nBasic Troubleshooting.pdf\nBrakes.pdf\nCabin Air Filter.pdf\nCenter Console.pdf\nComputer Relearn.pdf\nCooling Fans.pdf\nDefogger.pdf\nDoors.pdf\nDrive Belt Routing.pdf\nElectrical Component Locations.pdf\nEngine Cooling.pdf\nEngine Exhaust.pdf\nEngine Ignition.pdf\nEngine Lubrication.pdf\nEntertainment System.pdf\nEvap System.pdf\nExterior Lights.pdf\nExterior Trim.pdf\nFront Axle.pdf\nFront Suspension.pdf\nFuel Supply System.pdf\nFuses.pdf\nGauges.pdf\nHonda Pilot Owners Manual - 2003.pdf\nHonda Pilot Owners Manual - 2005.pdf\nHorns.pdf\nHVAC Climate Control.pdf\nHVAC Rear.pdf\nHVAC.pdf\nIgnition Switch.pdf\nInterior Lights.pdf\nInterior Trim.pdf\nMirrors.pdf\nMoonroof.pdf\nMultiplex Control System.pdf\nNavigation System.pdf\nPower Seats.pdf\nPower Steering.pdf\nPower Windows.pdf\nRear Axle Shafts.pdf\nRear Differential.pdf\nRear Suspension.pdf\nSeat Heaters.pdf\nStarter.pdf\nTiming Belt.pdf\nTransfer Case Remove.pdf\nTransfer Case.pdf\nUniversal Joint.pdf\nWiper Washer.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82cd041ce8d835d696a046dad1635b158a77b6d4","amp;dn":"Honda+Pilot+Service+Manual+2003+2004+2005+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82cd041ce8d835d696a046dad1635b158a77b6d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,205,4,28,232,216,53,214,150,160,70,218,209,99,91,21,138,119,182,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
