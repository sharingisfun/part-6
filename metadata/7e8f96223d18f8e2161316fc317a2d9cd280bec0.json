Whether ideological, nationalistic, or religious, all guerrilla insurgencies use similar tactics to advance their cause. War of the Flea's timeless analysis of the guerrilla fighterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s means and methods provides a fundamental resource for any reader seeking to understand this distinct form of warfare and the challenge it continues to present to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armed forces in the Philippines, Colombia, and elsewhere.\n\n\nReview\n&quot;[The author has] the odd accolade of being the only American among Castro's defending forces at Playa Giron....He makes an excellent case, a sort of modern Sun Tzu who finds romance in the abstract guerilla formula of juggling time, space, and will.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very interesting on the popular level, and a good example of political journalism...&quot;\n\n&quot;Has new relevance as terrorist organizations inspired by new revolutionaries dominate the international security landscape. . . . Reading The War of the Flea is an excellent beginning to understanding the current problems facing the military.&quot;\nAbout the Author\nRobert Taber traveled to Cuba in the late 1950s as a CBS investigative journalist to cover the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burgeoning revolutionary movement. He became an eyewitness to history as he marched from the Sierra Maestra to Havana with the ragtag revolutionaries, led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, who forced Batista to flee the country. Taber also wrote M-26: Biography of a Revolution. \n\nFile Size: 2039 KB\nPrint Length: 214 pages\nPublisher: Potomac Books Inc.
