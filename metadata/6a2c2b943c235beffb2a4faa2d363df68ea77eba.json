The show was created and produced by Irwin Allen. Land of the Giants was the fourth of Allen's science fiction TV series. The show was aired on ABC and released by 20th Century Fox Television. The series was filmed entirely in color and ran for 51 episodes. The show starred Gary Conway and Don Marshall. Author Murray Leinster also wrote three novels in 1968 and 1969 based on the television series\n\nSet in the then-future year of 1983, the series tells the tale of the crew and passengers of a sub-orbital transport spaceship called the Spindrift. In the pilot episode, the Spindrift is en route from Los Angeles to London via the ultra-fast route of a parabolic trajectory. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the Spindrift encounters a strange space storm and is transported to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than its counterpart on Earth. The Spindrift crew calls the inhabitants &quot;the giants&quot;. Given relative proportions shown on the show, the giants are about 72 feet tall (similar to Gulliver's situation in the second part of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, when he is in the land of Brobdingnag). Everything on their planet is built to their scale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ buildings, cars, animals, etc. The Spindrift crashes on this planet and becomes inoperable.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Giants&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Giants&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062578/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062578/episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062578/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062578/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a2c2b943c235beffb2a4faa2d363df68ea77eba","amp;dn":"Land+of+the+Giants+1969+Season+2+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a2c2b943c235beffb2a4faa2d363df68ea77eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,44,43,148,60,35,91,239,251,42,79,170,45,54,61,246,142,167,126,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
