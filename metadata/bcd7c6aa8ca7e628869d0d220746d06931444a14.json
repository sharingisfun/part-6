Could it?\n\nCandace Andrews has had enough of pleasing others. In an act of birthday rebellion, she sets out to please herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€by walking into the tattoo parlor owned by her cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-boyfriend. All she wants is a little ink, and BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the guy to give it to her.\n\nAs soon as she submits to his masterful hands, though, the forbidden attraction sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always felt for him resurfacesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and she realizes the devilishly sexy artist could give her so much more.\n\nSweet, innocent Candace is the last person Brian expected to see again. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not, and her family despises him. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need the hassle, but he needs her, and this time no one is taking her away. Not even those who threaten to make his life a living hell.\n\nBacked into a corner, Candace faces the worst kind of choice. Cave in to those who think Brian is a living nightmareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or hold her ground and risk it all for the one man who rocks her world.\n\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd7c6aa8ca7e628869d0d220746d06931444a14","amp;dn":"Rock+Me+by+Cherrie+Lynn+%28Ross+Siblings+Book+2%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd7c6aa8ca7e628869d0d220746d06931444a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,215,198,170,140,167,230,40,134,157,13,34,7,70,208,105,49,68,74,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
