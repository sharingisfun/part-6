He becomes attracted to Lisa Fredericks who works in the same company. After work, Barry witnesses the murder of Lisa and goes to a bar to get drunk. Later that night, there is a storm and Barry gets a shock from a lamp's faulty power wire at exactly 12:01 am. The next morning, he realizes that everything is happening exactly as it did the previous day. The next morning the day is repeated again. It is now Barry's job--being the only person alive who is aware of this time loop--to stop the murder of Lisa, and stop the time loop or be caught in time forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ce7f220aa1fd85ece151289ec3603ad8fdb578","amp;dn":"12+01+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ce7f220aa1fd85ece151289ec3603ad8fdb578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,206,127,34,10,161,253,133,236,225,81,40,158,195,96,58,216,253,181,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
