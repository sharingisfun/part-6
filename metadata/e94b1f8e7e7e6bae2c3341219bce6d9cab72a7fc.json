Soon after Buck departs, Earth is devastated by a nuclear war caused by a \nrenegade group of U.S. military officers. In 2491, Buck, who has survived due to the \nfreezing, is revived and tries to adjust to life on 25th-century post-nuclear Earth.\n\n\nDVD's are ripped with DVD Decrypter &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvddecrypter.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvddecrypter.com&lt;/a&gt;\nDVD's are unmolested and not shrunk.\nRegion 1 format.\nAmerican English.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_in_the_25th_Century_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_in_the_25th_Century_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078579/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078579/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e94b1f8e7e7e6bae2c3341219bce6d9cab72a7fc","amp;dn":"TV+Series%3A+Buck+Rogers+in+the+25th+Century+%2879-81%29+DVD+rips+%28ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e94b1f8e7e7e6bae2c3341219bce6d9cab72a7fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,75,31,142,126,126,107,174,44,51,65,33,155,206,109,156,171,114,167,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
