With a successful tour and a host of publicity, Planet Waves was a hit, enjoying a brief stay at #1 on the US Billboard chartsÃ¢â‚¬â€a first for the artistÃ¢â‚¬â€and #7 in the UK. Critics were not as negative as they had been with some then-recent Bob Dylan albums (namely Self Portrait and Dylan), but still not enthusiastic for the album's brand of laid-back roots rock.\n\nThe album was originally set to be titled Ceremonies of the Horsemen, a reference to the song &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;, from the 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home; the release was delayed two weeks when Dylan decided to change the title at the last minute. Another, earlier working title was Wedding Song.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;On a Night Like This&quot;   \t2:57\n02. \t&quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;   \t3:27\n03. \t&quot;Tough Mama&quot;   \t4:17\n04. \t&quot;Hazel&quot;   \t2:50\n05. \t&quot;Something There Is About You&quot;   \t4:45\n06. \t&quot;Forever Young&quot;   \t4:57\n07. \t&quot;Forever Young&quot;   \t2:49\n08. \t&quot;Dirge&quot;   \t5:36\n09. \t&quot;You Angel You&quot;   \t2:54\n10. \t&quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;   \t2:56\n11. \t&quot;Wedding Song&quot;   \t4:42\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    Bob Dylan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals\n    Rick Danko Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, violin, backing vocalist\n    Levon Helm Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, mandolin\n    Garth Hudson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, organ, piano, accordion, saxophones\n    Richard Manuel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano, keyboards, drums\n    Robbie Robertson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, bass guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4088619cb9b687f2b9156262bc7ce92723e38ac5","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Planet+Waves+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4088619cb9b687f2b9156262bc7ce92723e38ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,136,97,156,185,182,135,242,185,21,98,98,188,124,233,39,35,227,138,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
