Ltd. This game is based on the Millennium Falcon Arc chapters 22-27 of the manga.\n\nThe Berserk world is ruled by the member of God Hand, entities with the power to manipulate the destiny of mankind. During the ceremony of the incarnation of the mercenary leader Griffith, he murders many people. In the previous game, Guts, the Black Swordsman, stands up and manages to escape with his love Casca, but has his left arm severed.\n\nIn this game, demon-slaying anti-hero Guts continues his quest, with the help of the elf Puck and Casca, who suffers from amnesia, as well as new characters such as Farnese, Serpico, Isidro and Schierke. The storyline unfolds through animated cut-scenes.\n\nThe gameplay consists of over the top hack 'n slash gameplay mixed with strategic combos, recovery time, charged attacks and blocking. By timing rights, Guts can perform reversal strikes or counter attacks to damage difficult enemies. He can also unleash special attacks and fatalities. There are different weapons to choose from, a mixture of classic slashing weapons and modern guns. Guts also needs the help of his allies - they can restore your health or provide help during battles with additional attacks or modifiers. There is also a lock-on mode and a Berserker mode for faster and more powerful attacks.\n\nSlaying enemies results in cash which can be exchanged for magic or upgrades, such as sword proficiency, more health or boosts for your allies. When the game's main mode has been completed, two additional modes are unlocked: 100-Animal Murder (kill a set amount of enemies in a race against time) and Boss Rush (replay boss fights) Each completed level in the first mode is awarded with new weapons. The voice acting is done by actors from the original anime TV series.\n\n\nPublished by\nSammy Corporation\nDeveloped by\nSammy Corporation, Yuke's Co.
