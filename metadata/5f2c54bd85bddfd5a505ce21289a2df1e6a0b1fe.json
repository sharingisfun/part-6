It was released on May 9, 2014 by Epic Records and MJJ Music. It is the eleventh album released by Sony and Motown since Jackson's death in June 2009. L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records, curated and executively produced the album enlisting Timbaland to lead a team of record producers, including StarGate, Jerome &quot;J-Roc&quot; Harmon, John McClain, and Rodney Jerkins, to retool and contemporize the eight selected tracks. Jerkins produced the title song and is the only original song producer to work on the final productions.\n\nXscape was promoted across the Sony group of companies; Sony Mobile used a snippet of &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; in their advertising campaign for the Xperia Z2 mobile phone. Early reviews have been mixed to positive. &quot;Love Never Felt So Good&quot; was announced as the official lead single to premiere on May 1, 2014. A deluxe edition of the album will also include all of the songs in their original forms as well as one bonus track and two videos.\n\n\n\n01 Love Never Felt So Good\n02 Chicago\n03 Loving You\n04 A Place with No Name\n05 Slave to the Rhythm\n06 Do You Know Where Your Children Are\n07 Blue Gangsta\n08 XSCAPE\n09 Love Never Felt So Good (Original Version)\n10 Chicago (Original Version)\n11 Loving You (Original Version)\n12 A Place with No Name (Original Version)\n13 Slave to the Rhythm (Original Version)\n14 Do You Know Where Your Children Are (Original Version)\n15 Blue Gangsta (Original Version)\n16 XSCAPE (Original Version)\n17 Love Never Felt So Good\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 135 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 13mn 53s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 256 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Xscape [Deluxe Edition] Disc 1\nAlbum/Performer                          : Michael Jackson\nPerformer                                : Michael Jackson\nComposer                                 : Michael Jackson; Dr. Freeze; Fred &quot;Uncle Freddie&quot; Jerkins III; LaShawn Daniels; Cory Rooney; Paul Anka\nEncoded by                               : Rostromascarado\nPublisher                                : MJJ Music\nGenre                                    : Dance\nRecorded date                            : 2014\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 1h 13mn 53s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n***FRONT COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dF9kht8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dF9kht8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***CD LABEL***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OugBKGB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OugBKGB.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***BACK COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qZu3IZ1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qZu3IZ1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2c54bd85bddfd5a505ce21289a2df1e6a0b1fe","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson.2014.XSCAPE.%28Deluxe+Edition%29.%5BMp3%5D.256Kbps.-ROST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2c54bd85bddfd5a505ce21289a2df1e6a0b1fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,44,84,189,133,189,223,213,165,5,206,33,40,154,45,241,230,160,177,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
