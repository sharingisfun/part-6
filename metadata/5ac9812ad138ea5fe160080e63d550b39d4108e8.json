He was one of the great masters\nof Romantic music. Chopin's extant compositions were written primarily for the piano as a solo instrument. Though they are technically demanding,his style emphasises nuance and expressive depth. Chopin invented musical forms such\nas the ballade and was responsible for major innovations in forms such as the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tude, impromptu and prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lude. His works are masterpieces and mainstays of Romanticism in 19th-century classical music.\n\n\nIdil Biret (born 21 November 1941 in Ankara, Turkey)\n\nBorn in Ankara, Idil Biret started to learn the piano at the age of three and later studied at the Paris Conservatoire under the guidance of Nadia Boulanger, graduating at the age of fifteen with three first prizes. A pupil of Alfred Cortot and of Wilhelm Kempff, she embarked on her career as a soloist at the age of sixteen, appearing with major orchestras in the principal musical centres of the world, in collaboration with conductors of the greatest distinction.\n\n\nPeter Schmalfuss (January 13, 1937 - October 23, 2008)\n\nwas a German classical pianist born in Berlin, Germany. He studied with Walter Gieseking; with Adrian Aeschbacher; and, at the Beethoven-Class Positano, with Wilhelm Kempff. In 1960 he began touring in Europe, North Africa, and Asia; his performing accomplishments included presenting a complete cycle of the Beethoven sonatas on consecutive evenings. At the invitation of the Chopin Society of Warsaw, Poland, of which he was a member, he performed at ChopinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birth house in Zelazowa Wola, Poland. \n\n\nFlac files can easily be played with Winamp.
