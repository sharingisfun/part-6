She has also achieved note as a composer, political activist, film producer and director. She has won Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Original Song as well as multiple Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards, and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nShe is one of the most commercially and critically successful female entertainers in modern entertainment history and one of the best selling solo recording artists in the US, with RIAA-certified shipments of over 71 million albums. She is the highest ranking female artist on the Recording Industry Association of America's (RIAA) Top Selling Artists list.\n\nStreisand is a member of the short list of entertainers with the distinction of having won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award. She has been named a Kennedy Center Honoree for 2008.\n\nTimeless: Live in Concert is a live album released by Barbra Streisand on September 19, 2000. It was her fifth live album and was released on Columbia Records. The album was issued a week before what were said to be her final concerts in September 2000 and would reach platinum certification.\n\nTimeless is a double album which includes moments from BarbraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New Year's Eve, 1999 and New Year's Day, 2000 shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. The release is set up like a play in two acts and even has a two-minute entr'acte featuring conductor, Marvin Hamlisch, who is also present throughout the performance. It opens with a dramatization of her first, amateur recording session, in which Lauren Frost plays a part described in the credits as &quot;Young Girl&quot; though Streisand later refers to her as &quot;my little-girl self&quot; and &quot;mini me&quot;. The rest of Act One traces Streisand's career from her club days to Broadway and her movie performances.\n\nAct two opens with several of BarbraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s duets. This section is followed by dialogue and songs both reminiscent and optimistic thanks to the backdrop of the New YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s holiday. As the midnight hour approaches, Barbra is joined on stage by husband, James Brolin. Much of the dialogue takes place as small scenes or skits about time and timelessness. The CD version includes songs that span StreisandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career up to that time, such as &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;, from her debut album, and &quot;At the Same Time&quot; from her 1997 album &quot;Higher Ground&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1826d8f02ed76e4300728412dcbc7c9c7b53b84f","amp;dn":"Barbara+Streisand+Timeless+Live+in+Concert+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blaz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1826d8f02ed76e4300728412dcbc7c9c7b53b84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,38,216,240,46,215,110,67,0,114,132,18,220,188,124,156,123,83,184,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
