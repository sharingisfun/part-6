It offers a detailed discussion of holocaust imagery and the history of victim-centered writing in nationalism theory, including the links between the comparative genocide debate, the so-called holocaust industry, and Serbian and Croatian nationalism. No studies on Yugoslavia have thus far devoted significant space to such analysis.\n\nReview\n&quot;[T]he author has succeeded in exploring his subject in a way which is both lively and genuinely informative. ... extremely well written, based on a wide range of relevant sources and sensible and generally persuasive in its judgements ... His discussion of the debate about the Holocaust is sophisticated and based on a thorough knowledge of the relevant debates.&quot; -- James Mayall, Cambridge University\nAbout the Author\nDavid Bruce Macdonald is Lecturer in Political Studies, University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\nPaperback: 256 pages\nPublisher: Manchester University Press (April 19, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0719064678\nISBN-13: 978-0719064678","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532403883d74da23a5a58376b583706ba21b669e","amp;dn":"Balkan+Holocausts%3F%3A+Serbian+and+Croatian+Victim+Centered+Propaga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532403883d74da23a5a58376b583706ba21b669e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,36,3,136,61,116,218,35,165,165,131,118,181,131,112,107,162,27,102,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
