Lipton and Williams challenge the prevailing myths of each discipline and provide a logical, scientific and practical way to understand and use these revolutionary new ideas. The video is a masterful blend of the biology of beliefs and the psychology of change. As you watch the puzzle pieces fit together, you will experience the inseparable nature of the mind/body connection.\n\nRip Information:\nPart 1: Piecing It All Together 1of2 Bruce Lipton - The Biology of Perception.avi\nRun time: 01:08:52\n432x320\nXvid\nStereo MP3 VBR audio\n\nPart 2: Piecing It All Together 2of2 Rob Williams - The Psychology of Change.avi\nRun time: 01:13:07\n496x368\nXvid\nStereo MP3 VBR audio\n\n\n\nThe New Biology:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spirit2000.info/store/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spirit2000.info/store/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=17&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRecent advances in cellular science are heralding an important evolutionary turning point. For almost fifty years we have held the illusion that our health and fate were preprogrammed in our genes, a concept referred to as genetic determinacy. Though mass consciousness is currently imbued with the belief that the character of one's life is genetically predetermined, a radically new understanding is unfolding at the leading edge of science. Cellular biologists now recognize that the environment, the external universe and our internal physiology, and more importantly, our perception of the environment, directly controls the activity of our genes. This video will broadly review the molecular mechanisms by which environmental awareness interfaces genetic regulation and guides organismal evolution. \n\n\nRip Information:\nPart 1: Bruce Lipton - The New Biology - Where Mind and Matter Meet 1of2.avi\nRun time: 01:04:12\n512x384\nXvid\nStereo MP3 VBR audio\n\nPart 2: Bruce Lipton - The New Biology - Where Mind and Matter Meet 2of2.avi\nRun time: 01:35:00\n512x384\nXvid\nStereo MP3 audio\n\nThe Book\nThis book will forever change how you think about your own thinking. Stunning new scientific discoveries about the biochemical effects of the brainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s functioning show that all the cells of your body are affected by your thoughts. The author, a renowned cell biologist, describes the precise molecular pathways through which this occurs. Using simple language, illustrations, humor and everyday examples, he demonstrates how the new science of epigenetics is revolutionizing our understanding of the link between mind and matter, and the profound effects it has on our personal lives and the collective life of our species..\n\n100 WORD DESCRIPTION:\nThe Biology of Belief is a groundbreaking work in the field of New Biology. Author Dr. Bruce Lipton is a former medical school professor (University of Wisconsin) and research scientist (Stanford University School of Medicine). His experiments, and that of other leading-edge scientists, have examined in great detail the processes by which cells receive information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes/DNA do not control our biology; that instead, DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. Dr. LiptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a major breakthrough showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.\n\nReviews:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBruce Lipton's delightfully-written The Biology of Belief is a much needed antidote to the &quot;bottom-up&quot; materialism of today's society. The idea that DNA encodes all of life's development is being successfully employed in genetic engineering. At the same time, the shortfall of this approach is becoming evident. The Biology of Belief is a review of a quarter-century of pioneering results in Epigenetics, heralded by The Wall Street Science Journal in mid-2004 as an important new field. Its personal style makes it eminently readable and enjoyable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nKarl H. Pribram, M.D., PhD., (Hon, Multi)\nProfessor Emeritus, Stanford University; Distinguished Research Professor, Cognitive Neuroscience at Georgetown University, Dept of Psychology and George Mason University, School of Computational Sciences\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn this paradigm-busting book, Bruce Lipton delivers a TKO to Old Biology. With a left to Darwinian dogma and a right to allopathic medicine, he breaks out of the physicalist box into enlightenment on the mind/body (belief/biology) system. Must read, much fun.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nRalph Abraham, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Mathematics, University of California at Santa Cruz. Author of Foundations of Mechanics; Dynamics, the Geometry of Behavior; and Chaos, Gaia, Ero\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBruce LiptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book is the definitive summary of the new biology and all it implies. It is magnificent, profound beyond words, and a delight to read. It synthesizes an encyclopedia of critical new information into a brilliant yet simple package. These pages contain a genuine revolution in thought and understanding, one so radical that it can change the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nJoseph Chilton Pearce, Ph.D.\nAuthor of Magical Child; The Crack in the Cosmic Egg: New Constructs of Mind and Reality; EvolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s End: Claiming the Potential of Our Intelligence among others.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b8bb60d0f38551b8a6016ec4519cc725032c35","amp;dn":"Bruce+Lipton+-+The+Biology+of+Perception+and+The+New+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b8bb60d0f38551b8a6016ec4519cc725032c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,184,187,96,208,243,133,81,184,166,1,110,196,81,156,199,37,3,44,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
