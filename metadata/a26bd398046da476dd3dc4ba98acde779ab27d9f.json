When he passed away, his two sons swore to protect them, but the oldest, Lord Garmadon, was consumed by \ndarkness and wanted to possess them all. A battle between brothers broke out and Lord Garmadon was struck down and banished to the Underworld. \nPeace returned to Ninjago as the younger brother, Sensei Wu, hid the elemental weapons in the far corners of Ninjago. Centuries later, Lord Garmadon \nhas returned with the help of his Skeleton army to collect the Golden Weapons. Sensei Wu turns to the aid of four young Ninja who are to be trained to \nbecome the protectors of each of the weapons. \n\n\n[URL=http://img12.imageshack.us/i/legoninjagominimovie1se.jpg/][IMG]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4761/legoninjagominimovie1se.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img855.imageshack.us/i/legoninjagominimovie2fl.jpg/][IMG]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1833/legoninjagominimovie2fl.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img442.imageshack.us/i/legoninjagominimovie6ba.jpg/][IMG]http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2057/legoninjagominimovie6ba.jpg[/IMG][/URL]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26bd398046da476dd3dc4ba98acde779ab27d9f","amp;dn":"Lego+Ninjago+Mini-Movies+1+-+6+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a26bd398046da476dd3dc4ba98acde779ab27d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,107,211,152,4,109,164,118,221,61,196,186,152,172,222,119,154,178,125,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
