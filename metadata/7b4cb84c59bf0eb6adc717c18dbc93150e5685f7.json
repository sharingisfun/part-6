For the foods of Italy, explained David, expanded far beyond minestrone and ravioli, to the complex traditions of Tuscany, Sicily, Lombardy, Umbria, and many other regions.

Her passion for real food, luscious, hearty, fresh, and totally authentic, will inspire anyone who wishes to recreate the abundant and highly unique regional dishes of Italy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4cb84c59bf0eb6adc717c18dbc93150e5685f7","amp;dn":"Italian+Food+by+Elizabeth+David","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4cb84c59bf0eb6adc717c18dbc93150e5685f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,76,184,76,89,191,14,182,173,199,23,193,141,188,147,21,14,86,133,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
