The manga was serialized in Tokuma Shoten's ShÃ…ï¿½nen Captain in 1996 with a total of 3 collected volumes when the magazine was discontinued in 1997. The series continued in ShÃ…ï¿½nen Gahosha's Young King Ours magazine, under the title Trigun Maximum (Ã£Æ’Ë†Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£â€šÂ¬Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Å¾Ã£â€šÂ­Ã£â€šÂ·Ã£Æ’Å¾Ã£Æ’Â  Toraigan Makishimamu), where it remained until finishing in 2008.\n\n[PLOT - SPOILER ALERT]\n\nTrigun revolves around a man known as &quot;Vash the Stampede&quot; and two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who follow him around in order to minimize the damages inevitably caused by his appearance. Most of the damage attributed to Vash is actually caused by bounty hunters in pursuit of the sixty billion double dollars bounty on Vash's head for the destruction of the city of July. However, he cannot remember the incident due to retrograde amnesia, being able to recall only fragments of the destroyed city and memories of his childhood past. Throughout his travels, Vash tries to save lives using non-lethal force. He is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who, like Vash, is a superb gunfighter with a mysterious past. As the series progresses, more about Vash's past and the history of human civilization on the planet Gunsmoke is revealed.\n\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\n\nVideo &amp; Source: DVD\nAudio Source: DVD\n\nFile Container: MKV\nVideo Format: h.265/HEVC [10-bit]\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\n\nAudio Type: 2 Channel Stereo\nTrack 1: English\nTrack 2: Japanese\nAudio Format: AAC\n\nSubtitle Language: English\nSubtitle Format: SSA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271a014b85559d273bcb6393c47a180268c5ffce","amp;dn":"Trigun+%28The+Complete+Anime+Series%29+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D+%5B540p%5D+%5BHEVC%5D+%28v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271a014b85559d273bcb6393c47a180268c5ffce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,26,1,75,133,85,157,39,59,203,99,147,196,122,24,2,104,197,255,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
