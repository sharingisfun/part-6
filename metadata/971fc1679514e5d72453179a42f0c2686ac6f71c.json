The First Christianity\nIn the first of a six-part series sweeping across four continents, Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch goes in search of Christianity's forgotten origins. He overturns the familiar story that it all began when the apostle Paul took Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome, showing that its origins lie further east, and that at one point it was poised to triumph in Asia. The headquarters of Christianity may well have been Baghdad not Rome, in which case western Christianity would have been very different.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3150 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.45GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nYou'll find the subtitles for episode 1 as a separate SRT file at forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971fc1679514e5d72453179a42f0c2686ac6f71c","amp;dn":"BBC+A+History+of+Christianity+1of6+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971fc1679514e5d72453179a42f0c2686ac6f71c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,31,193,103,149,20,229,215,36,83,23,154,66,240,194,104,106,198,247,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
