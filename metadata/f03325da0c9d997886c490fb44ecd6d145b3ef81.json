The name was applied to recordings made by\r\nOldham using a multitude of session musicians, including members of the Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones Songbook included an orchestral version of the Mick Jagger and\r\nKeith Richards song &quot;The Last Time&quot;, which was sampled by The Verve for their\r\ntrack &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. The threat of litigation over the license for the\r\nsample led to the entire copyright to the composition, belonging to Richard Ashcroft,\r\nThe Verve's frontman, being taken by ABKCO Records, and the sharing of the songwriting\r\ncredit with Jagger and Richards, even though they didn't compose the string segment\r\nthat The Verve sampleds\r\n\r\n\r\n1 - Blue Turns To Gray [02:58]\r\n2 - Satisfaction [02:57]\r\n3 - You Better Move On [03:11]\r\n4 - Time Is On My Side [03:18]\r\n5 - Heart Of Stone [03:06]\r\n6 - As Tears Go By [02:34]\r\n7 - Play With fire [02:23]\r\n8 - Theme for a Rolling Stone [03:15]\r\n9 - Tell Me [04:02]\r\n10 - Congratulations [03:02]\r\n11 - The Last Time [03:47]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: The Andrew Oldham Orchestra\r\nGenre: Instrumental Rock / Rock\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1966\r\nNumber of Tracks: 11\r\nTotal Duration: 34:38.173\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 855 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nChecksums Files: Made with Traders Little Helper\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 214 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03325da0c9d997886c490fb44ecd6d145b3ef81","amp;dn":"Andrew+Oldham+Orchestra+-+Rolling+Stones+Songbook+1966+%5BEAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03325da0c9d997886c490fb44ecd6d145b3ef81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,51,37,218,12,157,153,120,134,196,144,251,68,236,214,209,69,179,239,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
