I'm not sure what caused the EPUB corruption for some users - I'm able to open the EPUBs fine in calibre and MoonReader on my Android tablet. However, the missing images in both versions were an oversite and have been fixed.\n\nThis is a fixed re-release of the following: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9745248/Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics_%28epub_mobi_html%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9745248/Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics_%28epub_mobi_html%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginal notes below:\n\nThese ebooks were compiled from the free online edition of the Feynman Lectures on Physics hosted by Caltech and editied by Michael A. Gottlieb.\nI originally made this legal format-shift using a modified version of the flp.mobi[1] script for my personal use, months ago.\n\nAfter Mr. Gottlieb compared this downloading and format shifting process to &quot;raping&quot; the HTML, and threatened to remove the online version, I felt it necessary to take action.\n\nNot to minimize Mr. Gottlieb's contributions, but Feynman's works deserve to be free (libre), and this release will ensure that regardless of what Caltech or Gottlieb do.\n\nIf you enjoy, please consider purchasing a digital (PDF, or EPUB/MOBI when available) edition from   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/buy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/buy.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA huge amount of work went into editing and restoring this digital edition. Please send your thanks to Mr. Gottlieb and Rudolf Pfeiffer.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/fmap/flp.mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eec53c2621d9dd2610cdb52ff060ed59fbbb6e8","amp;dn":"Feynman+Lectures+on+Physics+%28epub%2Cmobi%2Chtml%29+-+FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eec53c2621d9dd2610cdb52ff060ed59fbbb6e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,236,83,194,98,29,157,210,97,12,219,82,255,6,14,213,159,187,182,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
