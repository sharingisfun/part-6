Jim Lahey, the baking genius behind New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated Sullivan Street Bakery and Co. pizza restaurant, has developed a brilliant recipe that requires no kneading and produces an irresistible crust in any home ovenÃ¢â‚¬â€gas or electricÃ¢â‚¬â€in fewer than five minutes. My Pizza shares this revolutionary technique and the creative pies that put Co. on the map, as well as recipes for salads, soups, and desserts to make a meal complete.\n           \nThe pizzas in this book arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t your usual, run-of-the-mill pies. In fact, JimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique topping pairingsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as Corn and Tomato, Coppa and Fennel, and Potato and LeekÃ¢â‚¬â€reinvigorate this American favorite. His whimsy is apparent in his Pepperoni Pie, which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t include the cured meat we have all come to expect; instead, riffing on Ã¢â‚¬Å“pepperoniÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as the Italian plural for Ã¢â‚¬Å“pepper,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jim offers a pie with red pepper puree, ground lamb, and pecorino cheese. To round out dinner, My Pizza also has recipes for starters and side saladsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as Cannellini Bean Toast, Pea Soup, and Bibb and Roasted Squash SaladÃ¢â‚¬â€and sweet finishes, from Milk Chocolate Sundae to Banoffee Pie.\n           \nWith gorgeous color photographs and helpful tips on equipment and techniques, My Pizza unlocks the secrets of great, easy pizza for home cooks everywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1e23613486d98a21715c7d05b54aef30671775","amp;dn":"My+Pizza+-+The+Easy+No-Knead++Make+Spectacular+Pizza+at+Home+-+J","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1e23613486d98a21715c7d05b54aef30671775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,30,35,97,52,134,217,138,33,113,92,125,5,181,74,239,48,103,23,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
