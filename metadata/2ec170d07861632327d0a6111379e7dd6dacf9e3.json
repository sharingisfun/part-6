The complete Dark Shadows released in five parts totaling 129Gbs. Including all bonus interviews from the DVD's. The order of the torrents follows the DVDs starting with the introduction of Barnabas Collins and running in sequence to the end. This fifth and final part is &quot;the Beginning&quot; collection, pre-Barnabas. This torrent collects DVD sets TB (The Beginning) 1-6.\n\nI have kept the original episode titles from the DVDs. I did not rename the episodes with their original episode numbers. The number ending the title string denotes the episode order (1-9), most being 8 or 9 episodes per disk. THe quality and file size were a trade-off, I tried rendering in the lowest bit rate (500kbps) while still maintaining good picture quality.
