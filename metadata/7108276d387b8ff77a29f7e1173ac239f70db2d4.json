This unique instrument was the first of its kind to include samples of real instruments, but as opposed to the modern-day digital sampler, the Mellotron pulled them off a magnetic tape loop that ran inside the keyboard. It came with various sounds for piano, strings, flutes, brass and is likely best described as the first-ever Ã¢â‚¬Å“band in a boxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Naturally, it was a revelation from the get-go. Early adopters included the Beatles, the Moody Blues and King Crimson, who all immortalized the unmistakable tone of the Mellotron in numerous hits. Today, this piece of instrument history is enjoying a massive resurgence in a wide range of genres.\n\nEZkeys Mellotoon captures the essence of this one-of-a-kind keyboard and comes with 15 individual instruments, carefully sampled directly from a model M400 Mellotron using a blend of direct and amped signals. On top of that, it includes a generous selection of custom effect and sound chain presets, giving you a completely new, creative outset to an already seemingly bottomless pool of awe-inspiring sounds.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nOur greets go to all hard working groups. \nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort. \n\nSupport the good developer if you like it. \nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand \nwhat you are doing and what it means. \n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMMXIV (12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7108276d387b8ff77a29f7e1173ac239f70db2d4","amp;dn":"Toontrack+EZkeys+Mellotoon+v1.0.1+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7108276d387b8ff77a29f7e1173ac239f70db2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,8,39,109,56,123,143,247,122,41,247,225,23,58,194,57,247,13,178,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
