It tells the story of Jean Paget; as a prisoner of war in Malaya during World War II and then her return to Malaya after the war where she discovers something that leads her on the search for romance and to a small outback community in Australia where she sets out to turn it into 'a town like Alice'. It was first published in 1950 when Shute had newly settled in Australia. The &quot;Alice&quot; in the title refers to Alice Springs, Australia.\n\nJean Paget, Joe Harman, Noel Strachan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045dcf0276c47253b5c8413cb01e09e3f7e946e1","amp;dn":"A+TOWN+LIKE+ALICE+-+Nevil+Shute.+Read+by+Robin+Bailey+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045dcf0276c47253b5c8413cb01e09e3f7e946e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,93,207,2,118,196,114,83,181,200,65,60,176,30,9,227,247,233,70,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
