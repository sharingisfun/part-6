The album's first two singles, &quot;Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)&quot; and &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, both topped the UK Singles Chart, while subsequent singles &quot;Cry Me Out&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot; and &quot;Turn It Up&quot; all reached the top twenty. Turn It Up peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, with sales of 855,805 copies in the United Kingdom.  The album was re-released as Turn It Up Louder on 18 October 2010. It was preceded by the release of &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; as its lead single, and includes nine other bonus songs. In 2010, it was reported that Interscope Records was planning to release Turn It Up in the United States with new songs in early 2011, which never materialised..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\n[02] Cry Me Out\n[03] Band Aid\n[04] Turn It Up\n[05] Boys And Girls\n[06] Gravity\n[07] My Love\n[08] Jack\n[09] Nothing Compares\n[10] Here We Go Again\n[11] The Way The World Works\n[12] Hold Me In Your Arms\n[13] Use Somebody\n[14] When Love Takes\n[15] Without You\n[16] Rolling Stone\n[17] Want You\n[18] Broken Arrow\n[19] Coming Home\n[20] Doing Fine (Without You)\n[21] Can't Make This Over\n[22] Catching Snowflakes\n\nPlay Time - 01h:15m:54s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 189mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
