Politically active in the social and student movements of the 1960s, and a member of PSIN (Socialist Party of the National Left), LaclauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oeuvre links the working class and new social movements. Rejecting Marxist economic determinism and the notion of class struggle, Laclau instead urged for a radical democracy where antagonisms could be expressed. Frequently described as post-Marxist, LaclauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings have focused on political movements. Politics and Ideology in Marxist Theory was LaclauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first published work, where readers can trace the early formation of ideas that shaped the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae0efd094b85ffca71e979acb167b9f87c1b0cab","amp;dn":"Politics+and+Ideology+in+Marxist+Theory%3A+Capitalism%2C+Fascism%2C+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae0efd094b85ffca71e979acb167b9f87c1b0cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,14,253,9,75,133,255,202,113,233,121,172,177,103,185,248,124,27,12,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
