Fly fast paced bombing sorties or fire rockets and machine guns at the enemy whilst the accurate flight dynamics adapt to the ever-changing situation!\nIntroduction\n\nEmerging from World War II as one of the most potent fighting arms on the planet, the US Navy recognized that the day of the piston-engine fighter was drawing to a close. Having supplied the fleet with the Tigercat and Bearcat, Grumman began design work on a carrier-based fighter to rival the McDonnell FH-1 Phantom. A conventional design with straight wings and excellent low speed characteristics, the first of 567  F9Fs reached the fleet in 1949 originally powered by a Rolls-Royce Nene engine providing 5,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nThey were none too soon. On August 6, 1950, Panthers were the first carrier jets to see action in Korea and performed almost half of all attack missions for the Navy and Marine Corps. Armament included four 20mm cannon plus two bombs or an assortment of rockets. Among the major Panther variants were the F9F-2B, a modified ground attack version with hardpoints for underwing stores; the F9F-5, the most numerous model, of which 616 were built; and the F9F-5P, an unarmed photo-surveillance version. A swept-wing model, the F9F-6 Cougar with higher speeds, would enter service in late 1951.\nNoteworthy Features\n\n    As with every Vertigo Studios aircraft, it is gorgeously constructed, inside and out.\n    2 x models included, F9F-5 and F9F-5P\n    Designed and built by the book.\n    Comes complete with a comprehensive PDF manual.\n    3D Ã¢â‚¬ËœSound ConeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Technology with an amazing sound set, engineered using authentic Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 recordings.\n    Every object or function creates a realistic noise!\n    Tru3D dynamic load editor that will affect aircraft weights on the fly.\n    DirectX 10 compatible models complete with virtual cockpit self-shadowing.\n    Systems and Tru3D gauges for ultimate realism taken beyond whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available by default.\n    Tru3D Instrumentation for the ultimate smooth flying experience.\n    Tru3D gauge lighting brings the instruments to life at night!\n    Fully customized lighting control system, including individually created night-lighting effects.\n    Customized high-resolution materials give the most realistic appearance to the aircraft, whilst being optimized for great performance!\n    6 historically accurate and detailed paint schemes.\n    Fuel delivery system is accurately simulated.\n    Fuel Tip Tank Dumping system.\n    2D Pop-ups, Configuration Editor, GPS and Radio.\n    Realistic canopy operation and animation.\n    Fully operable weapons pack with multiple munitions, including guns, bombs and rockets!\n    Light bloom on glass and shiny materials.\n    Exciting custom-made effects.\n\nConfiguration Editor\n\nA configuration editor is provided in-game to allow the F9F to be totally customized and readied for any sortie!
