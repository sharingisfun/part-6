Although the band mainly follows the path of the melodic death metal genre, much of their work shows strong influences from progressive death metal, especially their later albums. \r\n\r\nOmnium Gatherum's music is influenced by Gothenburg-style bands such as At The Gates, In Flames, Dissection, Dark Tranquillity, but also Iron Maiden, Death, Anathema and Megadeth among others.\r\n\r\nAlbums and others List aka Torrent Contents:\r\n\r\n1999 - Gardens Temples...This Hell (Demo)\r\n2003 - Spirits And August Light + Steal The Light (EP)\r\n2003 - Spirits And August Light + Steal The Light (EP) (Remaster 2008)\r\n2004 - Years In Waste\r\n2004 - Years In Waste (Remaster 2008)\r\n2007 - Stuck Here on Snakes Way\r\n2008 - Redshift\r\n2008 - The Redshift (Reissue 2014)\r\n2011 - New World Shadows\r\n2011 - New World Shadows (Korean Edition)\r\n2013 - Beyond\r\n2013 - Beyond (Digipak)\r\n2015 - Skyline (Single)\r\n2016 - Grey Heavens 320ak\r\nlogo.jpg\r\n\r\nFor individual tracks click files\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Jukka Pelkonen â€“ vocals (2006â€“Present)\r\n    Markus Vanhala (Insomnium) â€“ guitar (1996â€“Present)\r\n    Joonas &quot;Jope&quot; Koto (To/Die/For) â€“ guitar (2 May 2009, 13 June 2009 and 2010-2011: session member, 2011â€“Present: official member)\r\n    Aapo Koivisto â€“ keyboards (2005â€“Present)\r\n    Erkki Silvennoinen â€“ bass (2012â€“Present)\r\n    Jarmo Pikka â€“ drums (1999â€“Present)\r\n\r\nBy Request cause I still do em from time to time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77f6a08ccbd2187b8eadadd54f88261f513e9d5","amp;dn":"Omnium+Gatherum+Discography+1999+-2016+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d77f6a08ccbd2187b8eadadd54f88261f513e9d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,127,106,8,204,189,33,135,184,234,218,221,84,248,130,97,245,19,233,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
