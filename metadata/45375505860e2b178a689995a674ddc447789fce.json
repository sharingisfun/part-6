The story begins as the Queen of the Night sets Prince Tamino on a quest to rescue her daughter, Pamina from the evil Sarastro. On the way, he meets the bird-catcher Papageno, who is &quot;persuaded&quot; to help Tamino in his quest. Tamino's spiritual quest is counterpoised with Papageno's own earthly search for his one true love, Papagena. Both couples' strivings are juxtaposed with the eternal conflict between Sarastro and the Queen of the Night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45375505860e2b178a689995a674ddc447789fce","amp;dn":"P+Craig+Russell+-+The+Magic+Flute+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45375505860e2b178a689995a674ddc447789fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,55,85,5,134,14,43,23,138,104,153,149,166,116,221,196,71,120,159,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
