He had no idea where the plane was headed nor any recollection of the past two weeks. An alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three, he checked into a treatment facility shortly after landing. There he was told he could either stop using or die before he reached age 24. This is FreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acclaimed account of his six weeks in rehab.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df3c276040ed210907d7b673776f50f8bef6f25","amp;dn":"A+Million+Little+Pieces+-+James+Frey+%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df3c276040ed210907d7b673776f50f8bef6f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,243,194,118,4,14,210,16,144,125,123,103,55,118,245,15,139,239,111,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
