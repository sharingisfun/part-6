He is a former Police Officer and was until recently Director of Security at one of the world's largest IT companies. He is currently an International Security Consultant. With his blend of fast-paced suspense, humor, and informed commentary on IT and social media, Anders de la Motte represents a distinct new voice in Scandinavian crime fiction: wild, playful and full of references to popular culture, including his literary cousin Philip K. Dick.\n\nThe Game (#1): Follow the rules and everybody gets hurt . . . \n\nOne Sunday morning after a long night of partying, Henrik Ã¢â‚¬Å“HPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pettersson, a slacker with a lot of ego and very little impulse control, finds a cell phone of an unfamiliar make on a commuter train. Through insisting and slightly uncanny messages that refer to him by name, the phone invites him to play a game. HP accepts without hesitation. \n\nThe rules are that HP must complete tasks that range from childish pranks to criminal acts, as allocated by the mysterious Game Master. HP is the perfect contenderÃ¢â‚¬â€alienated from society, devoid of morals, and desperate for fame. His completion of the assignments are filmed and uploaded onto a protected server where viewers rate the PlayersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ performances. \n\nThe Game starts out innocently enough and then becomes increasingly risky, threatening the safety of someone close to HP. He is determined to become a superstar, but when the dark and tragic secrets of his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past are at stake, HP must make a choice. Will he suffer the humiliation of defeat, or will the need to win push him to the limitÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter the cost? \n\nFirst in a fast-paced and riveting trilogy, Game will leave you guessing. Follow the rules, and everybody gets hurt . . .\n\nBuzz (#2): Murder is such a buzz kill. . . . \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been four months since HP Pettersson was dragged into a ruthless Alternate Reality Game that nearly cost him his life. Although he now has everything he ever wished forÃ¢â‚¬â€freedom, money, and no responsibilitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t satisfied. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plagued by insomnia and paranoia, and misses the adrenaline rush of the Game. He misses the attention. At times, he even hopes the Game Master will find him. And when HP catches the eye of a rich and powerful CEO for all the wrong reasons, he may get his wish. But he quickly learns that sometimes, you have to be careful what you wish for . . .\n\nBubble (#3): No one gets out alive . . . \n\nHP could never have imagined heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d become entwined in a chaotic and dangerous game of life and death when he picked up a lost cell phone on a commuter train. He thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d escaped. \n\nNow, his paranoia quickly grows to mania, as he is convinced that the Game Master and past characters are following him and that the police are watching him. \n\nHP decides he must finish one last assignment and expose the Game MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets once and for allÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter what it costs him. \n\nWhat he uncovers is a potential link between his own fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and the GameÃ¢â‚¬â€ blurring the boundary between it and real life more than ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6884df0a25876a1c119c11c051b9ad2e5f6e01d","amp;dn":"The+Game+Trilogy+-+Anders+de+La+Motte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6884df0a25876a1c119c11c051b9ad2e5f6e01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,136,77,240,162,88,118,161,193,25,193,28,5,27,154,210,229,246,224,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
