This cartoon is cute, wholesome, and has plenty of clever dialogue.  Additionally, Spongebobs voice actor plays an amusing role - yet all we hear about is the gossip.  It took too much effort to get these episodes in HD, people are missing out on it, and the reviews are already being bombed on websites.\n\nI was able to get episodes 1-5 in 1080p.  6-17 are 720p.  I'll seed this for a while - seriously, give this show a chance and new episodes will be back next month.  Even when I went to show it to someone, I almost started to gossip about the issue but stopped myself - I almost didn't even realize I was about to.  Don't let women continue to use tears, hormonal manipulation, law/screaming/society, and the word 'bitter' against humanity any longer because it is slowly consuming us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256eaccb43e1a1947312bcc5b00bdf61e1bf0df1","amp;dn":"Clarence+Season+1+Episodes+1-17+%26amp%3B+Pilot+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256eaccb43e1a1947312bcc5b00bdf61e1bf0df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,110,172,203,67,225,161,148,115,18,188,197,176,11,223,97,225,191,13,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
