The plan was to play a show in every province and territory in Canada, from B.C. to Newfoundland to Nunavut. 'Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog... from the ocean to the permafrost' says Jack White. 'We wanted to play out of the way towns that don't usually get shows... the shows are better, it's better for the people, it's a better experience, it's way more unique, something interesting is going to happen... hopefully.'\nWhite called upon filmmaker Emmett Malloy to come and document this trek for the band. Malloy had directed videos for the band in the past, and seemed eager to hit the road with them. Equipped with a couple of 16mm cameras, and a few other documenting devices, the band and crew all headed north. The end result was 'Under Great White Northern Lights'.\n'Under Great White Northern Lights' is a visual and emotional feature length film documenting The White Stripes making their way through Canada and culminating with their 10th anniversary show in Nova Scotia. The film documents the band playing shows all over Canada; from local bowling alleys, to city buses, and onward to the legendary Savoy Theater for the\n10th Anniversary show. A show that turned out to be the longest show the band had ever done on stage together.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b24494962b4c4842726c2b1408a45b6c66416339","amp;dn":"The+White+Stripes-Under+Great+White+Northern+Lights+mp3-192-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b24494962b4c4842726c2b1408a45b6c66416339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,68,148,150,43,76,72,66,114,108,43,20,8,164,91,108,102,65,99,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
