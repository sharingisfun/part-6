Recorded in Los Angeles, California in April 1958 &amp; October 1959.This historical CD contains some of guitarist Wes Montgomery's first recordings; in fact only three small-group songs predate these performances. The then-obscure guitarist is heard in two different quintets, both of which include his brothers Buddy (on piano) and Monk (playing electric bass). The earlier set has Harold Land's tenor as a lead voice while altoist Pony Poindexter takes his place on the later date, Wes's sound was already quite recognizable and he contributes six originals which alternate with Harold Land's &quot;Hymn for Carl&quot; and four standards.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1- &quot;Far Wes&quot; (Wes Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:51\n2- &quot;Leila&quot; (Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n3- &quot;Old Folks&quot; (Willard Robison, Dedette Hill) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:35\n4- &quot;WesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Tune&quot; (Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n5- &quot;Hymn for Carl&quot; (Harold Land) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:33\n6- &quot;Montgomeryland Funk&quot; (Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n7- &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy&quot; (Edgar Sampson, Benny Goodman, Chick Webb) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n8- &quot;MonkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shop&quot; (Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54\n9- &quot;Summertime&quot; (George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:50\n10- &quot;Falling in Love with Love&quot; (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:13\n11- &quot;Renie&quot;(Montgomery) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n\nPersonnel\n\nWes Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nPony Poindexter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ alto saxophone (tracks 8-11)\nHarold Land Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone (tracks 1-7)\nBuddy Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\nMonk Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric bass\nTony Bazley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 1-7)\nLouis Hayes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 8-11) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32c6b5eae3836106df734b0f092ce0b17d84023","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+Far+Wes+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32c6b5eae3836106df734b0f092ce0b17d84023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,44,107,94,174,56,54,16,109,247,52,176,240,146,206,11,23,216,64,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
