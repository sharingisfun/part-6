Coherent explanations and practical examples have made this one of the leading texts in the field. The third edition continues in this tradition, enhancing it with more practical material.\nThe new edition has been reorganized to allow more flexibility in the way the course is taught. Now, instructors can easily choose whether they would like to teach a course which emphasizes database application development or a course that emphasizes database systems issues. New overview chapters at the beginning of parts make it possible to skip other chapters in the part if you don't want the detail.\n\nMore applications and examples have been added throughout the book, including SQL and Oracle examples. The applied flavor is further enhanced by the two new database applications chapters.\n\nHardcover: 1104 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 3 edition (August 14, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0072465638\nISBN-13: 978-0072465631","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5812ddd08aa4d891aa7e954c47aa633513fffefa","amp;dn":"Database+Management+Systems+3rd+edition+by+Ramakrishnan+and+Gehr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5812ddd08aa4d891aa7e954c47aa633513fffefa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,18,221,208,138,164,216,145,170,126,149,76,71,170,99,53,19,255,254,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
