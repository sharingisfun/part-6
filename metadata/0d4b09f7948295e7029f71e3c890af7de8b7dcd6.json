Meanwhile, young Tavi of Calderon joins a newly formed legion under an assumed name even as the ruthless Kalare unites with the Canim, bestial enemies of the realm whose vast numbers spell certain doom for Alera. When treachery from within destroys the army's command structure, Tavi finds himself leading an inexperienced, poorly equipped legion - the only force standing between the Canim horde and the war-torn realm.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4b09f7948295e7029f71e3c890af7de8b7dcd6","amp;dn":"Codex+Alera+Book+3+-+Cursors+Fury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4b09f7948295e7029f71e3c890af7de8b7dcd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,75,9,247,148,130,149,231,2,159,113,227,200,144,175,125,232,183,220,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
