Also featuring ex-Spooky Tooth bassist Greg Ridley along with drummer Jerry Shirley, the fledgling group spent the first several months of its existence locked away in Marriott's Essex cottage, maintaining a relentless practice schedule. Signed to the Immediate label, Humble Pie soon issued their debut single &quot;Natural Born Boogie,&quot; which hit theTop Ten and paved the way for the group's premiere LP, As Safe as Yesterday Is. \n\nFormed: 1968 in Essex, England\n\nDisbanded: 1975\n\nGroup Members:\n\nSteve Marriott\nJerry Shirley\nPeter Frampton\nGreg Ridley\nDave &quot;Clem&quot; Clempson\nAnthony Jones\nBob Tench\n\n\n\nThe Definitive Collection unites original recordings from Humble Pie's early-'70s A&amp;M output, highlighting the gravelly vocals of ex-Small Faces frontman Steve Marriott along with the driving guitars of first Peter Frampton and then Frampton's replacement, Dave &quot;Clem&quot; Clempson. During their peak years, Humble Pie were the premier boogie band. Their output of the era inundated album rock radio with the originals &quot;Hot 'n' Nasty&quot; and &quot;30 Days in the Hole,&quot; Eddie Cochran's &quot;C'mon Everybody,&quot; and the Ray Charles-inspired epic &quot;I Don't Need No Doctor,&quot; which was recorded live at the Fillmore and was Frampton's swan song with the band. Also included are several hard-edged cover versions of blues classics -- &quot;Four Day Creep,&quot; &quot;Rollin' Stone,&quot; and &quot;I'm Ready&quot; -- which were a significant part of their regular live set at the time. While there are other, more exhaustive compilations, such as the double-disc 1994 set Hot 'n' Nasty: The Anthology, this is the best concise overview of the group's career, containing the most hits on a single disc. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
