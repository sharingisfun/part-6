He released his debut Christian album, Save Me from Myself, in 2008.\n\nWelch and Munky are ranked at No. 26 of Guitar World's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e9f00d5b90a605cdd05cceb542d85dd92676087","amp;dn":"Brian+Head+Welch+Discography+2006-2011+%285+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e9f00d5b90a605cdd05cceb542d85dd92676087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,159,0,213,185,10,96,92,221,5,204,235,84,45,133,221,146,103,96,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
