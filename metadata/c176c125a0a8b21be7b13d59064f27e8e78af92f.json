In the tradition of the earlier ICHMS conferences, this 9 ICHMSâ€™2005 meeting served as an multidisciplinary forum for the presentation and discussion of the most recent research on transition to hydrogen-based energy systems, technologies for hydrogen production, storage, utilization, materials processing and chemical behavior, energy and environmental problems. The aim of ICHMSâ€™2005 was to provide the wide overview of the latest scientific results on basic research and technological applications of hydrogen interactions with metals and other materials. The active representatives from industry, research/academic organizations and governmental agencies could meet, discuss and present the most recent advances in hydrogen concepts, processes and systems, to evaluate current progress and to exchange academic information, to identify research needs and future development in this important area. This conference should help further the progress of hydrogen-based science and promote the role of hydrogen in the energy field. The ICHMSâ€™2005 was the conference, where a related new important topic of considerable current interest on fullerene-related materials as hydrogen storage was included into the conference program. This meeting gave an opportunity for researchers to cover the entire range of basic and applied materials focusing on synthesis, structure, properties and applications of diverse carbon materials ranging from nanotubes and fullerenes to carbon fiber composites and sorbents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c176c125a0a8b21be7b13d59064f27e8e78af92f","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Materials+Science+and+Chemistry+of+Carbon+Nanomaterials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c176c125a0a8b21be7b13d59064f27e8e78af92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,118,193,37,160,168,178,27,231,177,61,89,6,79,39,232,231,138,249,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
