Last June, after more than six \n\nmonths in limbo, the Deftones shelved Eros -- which had become a \n\nconstant reminder of Cheng's absence -- and started over.\n\n&quot;With everything we were going through, the Deftones needed to pour \n\nall of our thoughts, energy, and emotions into something newÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\nsomething more optimistic,&quot; singer Chino Moreno, 36, tells SPIN.com \n\nfrom his home in Los Angeles. &quot;I couldn't tour behind a record with \n\nall these memories of Chi attached to it. Musically, it's something \n\nthat we haven't done before,&quot; he explains. &quot;It's veryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ sludgy, like a \n\nchainsaw-type of riff but very slow. I shouldn't say this, but it's \n\nclunkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ in an awesome way.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd03a84517c0499273d7f28bdb3b9ca44d20551","amp;dn":"Deftones+-+Diamond+Eyes+%5Bmp3-320-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd03a84517c0499273d7f28bdb3b9ca44d20551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,208,58,132,81,124,4,153,39,61,127,40,189,179,185,202,68,210,5,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
