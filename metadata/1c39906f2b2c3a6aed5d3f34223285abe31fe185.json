Hinduism does not lend itself easily to a strictly chronological account. Many of its central texts cannot be reliably dated within a century; its central tenets arise at particular moments in Indian history and often differ according to gender or caste; and the differences between groups of Hindus far outnumber the commonalities. Yet the greatness of Hinduism lies precisely in many of these idiosyncratic qualities that continues to inspire debate today. This groundbreaking work elucidates the relationship between recorded history and imaginary worlds, the inner life and the social history of Hindus.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://divinity.uchicago.edu/images/faculty/doniger.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://divinity.uchicago.edu/images/faculty/doniger.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nWendy Doniger (O'Flaherty) (born November 20, 1940) is a American Indologist and Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School, the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations, and the Committee on Social Thought. She has taught at the University of Chicago since 1978. Much of her work is focused on translating, interpreting and comparing elements of Hindu mythology through modern contexts of gender, sexuality and identity. She describes herself as &quot;a Sanskritist, indeed a recovering Orientalist&quot; and &quot;an old-fashioned philologist&quot;. However, her use of psychoanalysis is widely considered controversial.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c39906f2b2c3a6aed5d3f34223285abe31fe185","amp;dn":"The+Hindus+-+An+Alternative+History+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c39906f2b2c3a6aed5d3f34223285abe31fe185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,57,144,111,43,44,58,106,237,93,63,52,34,50,133,171,227,31,225,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
