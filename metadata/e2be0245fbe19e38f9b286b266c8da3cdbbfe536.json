In the book, published in 2003, Truss bemoans the state of punctuation  in the United Kingdom and the United States, and describes how rules are being relaxed in today's society. Her goal is to remind readers of the importance of punctuation in the English language by mixing humor and instruction.\n\nTruss dedicates the book &quot;to the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St. Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly precipitated the first Russian Revolution.&quot;\n\n\nThe title of the book is an amphibologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a verbal fallacy arising from an ambiguous grammatical constructionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and derived from a joke on bad punctuation:\n\n    A panda walks into a cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and proceeds to fire it at the other patrons.\n\n    'Why?' asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.\n\n    'Well, I'm a panda', he says, at the door. 'Look it up.'\n\n    The waiter turns to the relevant entry in the manual and, sure enough, finds an explanation. 'Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots, and leaves.'\n\n\nEditorial Reviews -   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Tolerance-Punctuation/dp/1592400876&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Tolerance-Punctuation/dp/1592400876&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nWho would have thought a book about punctuation could cause such a sensation? Certainly not its modest if indignant author, who began her surprise hit motivated by &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;despair&quot; at the current state of British usage: ungrammatical signs (&quot;BOB,S PETS&quot;), headlines (&quot;DEAD SONS PHOTOS MAY BE RELEASED&quot;) and band names (&quot;Hear'Say&quot;) drove journalist and novelist Truss absolutely batty. But this spirited and wittily instructional little volume, which was a U.K. #1 bestseller, is not a grammar book, Truss insists; like a self-help volume, it &quot;gives you permission to love punctuation.&quot; Her approach falls between the descriptive and prescriptive schools of grammar study, but is closer, perhaps, to the latter. (A self-professed &quot;stickler,&quot; Truss recommends that anyone putting an apostrophe in a possessive &quot;its&quot;-as in &quot;the dog chewed it's bone&quot;-should be struck by lightning and chopped to bits.) Employing a chatty tone that ranges from pleasant rant to gentle lecture to bemused dismay, Truss dissects common errors that grammar mavens have long deplored (often, as she readily points out, in isolation) and makes elegant arguments for increased attention to punctuation correctness: &quot;without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning.&quot; Interspersing her lessons with bits of history (the apostrophe dates from the 16th century; the first semicolon appeared in 1494) and plenty of wit, Truss serves up delightful, unabashedly strict and sometimes snobby little book, with cheery Britishisms (&quot;Lawks-a-mussy!&quot;) dotting pages that express a more international righteous indignation.\n\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nThis impassioned manifesto on punctuation made the best-seller lists in Britain and has followed suit here. Journalist Truss gives full rein to her &quot;inner stickler&quot; in lambasting common grammatical mistakes. Asserting that punctuation &quot;directs you how to read in the way musical notation directs a musician how to play,&quot; Truss argues wittily and with gusto for the merits of preserving the apostrophe, using commas correctly, and resurrecting the proper use of the lowly semicolon. Filled with dread at the sight of ubiquitous mistakes in store signs and headlines, Truss eloquently speaks to the value of punctuation in preserving the nuances of language. Liberally sprinkling the pages with Briticisms (&quot;Lawks-a-mussy&quot;) and moving from outright indignation to sarcasm to bone-dry humor, Truss turns the finer points of punctuation into spirited reading. \n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Audio CD\n    * Publisher: Penguin Audio; abridged edition (April 22, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0142800821\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0142800829\n    * Read by the Author\n\n\n01.
