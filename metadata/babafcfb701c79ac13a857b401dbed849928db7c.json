It, like her is now an aging old relic of things that have outlived their expectancy. A developer wants to buy it and tear it down to build a modern apartment building on it's site. Aniela has a 50 year old son (Krystof Globisz) who occasionally checks in to see how his ornery old mother is doing. He is often accompanied by his overweight 10 year old daughter (Patrycja Szewczyk) who Aniela finds as a spoiled, demanding, undisciplined brat. Aniela blames her husband's wife (Marta Waldera) for her son and granddaughter's laziness. Aniela is often taunted by and bothered by local kids. Her next door neighbors run a music academy for kids out of their home that she spies on daily. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Pora umierac.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.42 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 44mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 944 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 44mn\n      Bit rate : 1 742 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.282\n      Stream size : 1.27 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 44mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 143 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835834/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835834/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPolish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nDorota Kedzierzawska - Pora umierac [Time to Die] (2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babafcfb701c79ac13a857b401dbed849928db7c","amp;dn":"Dorota+Kedzierzawska+-+Pora+umierac+%5BTime+to+Die%5D+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babafcfb701c79ac13a857b401dbed849928db7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,186,252,251,112,28,121,172,19,168,87,180,1,219,237,132,153,40,219,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
