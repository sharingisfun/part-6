With its story about the friendship between the son of a Hasidic rabbi and a more secularly-minded Jewish boy in Brooklyn, the novel established Potok's reputation.  Critics praised the book for its vivid rendering of the closed Hasidic community, and it won the Edward Lewis Wallant Award and was nominated for the National Book Award.\n\nPotok wrote a sequel, THE PROMISE (1969), which details the issues of the value and identity between Orthodox and Hasidic Jews and won the Athenaeum Literary Award.  He returned to the subject of Hasidism for a third time with MY NAME IS ASHER LEV (1972), the story of a young artist and his conflict with the traditions of his family and community.  Potok followed this novel with a sequel as well, THE GIFT OF ASHER LEV (1990).\n\nPotok continued to examine the conflict between secular and religious interests in other novels, including IN THE BEGINNING (1975) and DAVITA'S HARP (1985).  His most recent works were I AM THE CLAY (1992), a novel about the Korean war; THE GATES OF NOVEMBER (1996), a non-fiction chronicle of a Jewish family in the Soviet Union; and OLD MEN AT MIDNIGHT (2001), a collection of novellas.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* THE CHOSEN (Fawcett, 1967)\n\n* DAVITA'S HARP (Fawcett, 1985)\n\n* THE GATES OF NOVEMBER (Fawcett, 1996)\n\n* THE GIFT OF ASHER LEV (Fawcett, 1990)\n\n* I AM THE CLAY (Fawcett, 1992)\n\n* IN THE BEGINNING (Fawcett, 1975)\n\n* MY NAME IS ASHER LEV (Anchor, 2000)\n\n* OLD MEN AT MIDNIGHT (Ballantine, 2001)\n\n* THE PROMISE (Anchor, 1997)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
