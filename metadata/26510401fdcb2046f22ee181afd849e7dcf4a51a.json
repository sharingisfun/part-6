The unambiguous specification and description of components and their relationships in such an architecture requires a coherent architecture modelling language.\n\nLankhorst and his coÃ¢â‚¬â€˜authors present such an enterprise modelling language that captures the complexity of architectural domains and their relations and allows the construction of integrated enterprise architecture models. They provide architects with concrete instruments that improve their architectural practice. As this is not enough, they additionally present techniques and heuristics for communicating with all relevant stakeholders about these architectures. Since an architecture model is useful not only for providing insight into the current or future situation but can also be used to evaluate the transition from Ã¢â‚¬ËœasÃ¢â‚¬â€˜isÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Ã¢â‚¬ËœtoÃ¢â‚¬â€˜beÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the authors also describe analysis methods for assessing both the qualitative impact of changes to an architecture and the quantitative aspects of architectures, such as performance and cost issues.\n\nThe modelling language presented has been proven in practice in many realÃ¢â‚¬â€˜life case studies and has been adopted by The Open Group as an international standard. So this book is an ideal companion for enterprise IT or business architects in industry as well as for computer or management science students studying the field of enterprise architecture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26510401fdcb2046f22ee181afd849e7dcf4a51a","amp;dn":"Enterprise+Architecture+at+Work%3A+Modelling%2C+Communication+and+An","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26510401fdcb2046f22ee181afd849e7dcf4a51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,81,4,1,253,203,32,70,242,46,225,129,175,216,73,231,220,244,165,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
