Well researched with lots of excellent photographs (photography was in it's infancy at the time) and illustrations. This particular book does an excellent job of wrapping up the last days of the civil war. For those interested in grasping a big picture of the last days of the war I highly recommend this book.\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2bf533fe68eb1fc831c16e3cf038d794b3a5f9","amp;dn":"Pursuit+to+Appomattox-The+Last+Battles+%28Time-Life+The+Civil+War%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2bf533fe68eb1fc831c16e3cf038d794b3a5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,43,245,51,254,104,235,31,200,49,193,110,60,240,56,215,148,179,165,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
