Translated by Mike Mitchell.\n\nISBN: 9780199238293 | 256 pages | PDF\n\n\nOne of the great works of the twentieth century, Franz Kafka's THE TRIAL has been read as a study of political power, a pessimistic religious parable, or a crime novel where the accused man is himself the problem.  In it, a man wakes up one morning to find himself under arrest for an offence which is never explained.  Faced with this ambiguous but threatening situation, Josef K. gradually succumbs to its psychological pressure.\n\nOne of the iconic figures of modern world literature, Kafka writes about universal problems of guilt, responsibility, and freedom.  He offers no solutions, but provokes his readers to arrive at meanings of their own. \n\nThis new translation by Mike Mitchell captures Kafka's distinctive style.  Based on the German critical edition, it includes not only the main text but the chapters Kafka left incomplete and which are often omitted.\n\nIn his Introduction, Ritchie Robertson considers the many puzzles in the novel and the different interpretations to which the novel has been subjected.  The book also includes a Biographical Preface, an up-to-date bibliography, and a chronology of Kafka's life.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b62eb0dcf5e3daf04c00d8ba0136a871535f29","amp;dn":"Franz+Kafka+-+The+Trial+%28Oxford+World%27s+Classics%2C+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b62eb0dcf5e3daf04c00d8ba0136a871535f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,182,46,176,220,245,227,218,240,76,0,216,186,1,54,168,113,83,95,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
