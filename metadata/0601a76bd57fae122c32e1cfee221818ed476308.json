The purpose  of SideKick4 is to  make this \n   process possible and a lot easier. You  will be able to make a stereo  side \n   -chaining setup just by loading two instances of the VST plugin on 2 stereo \n   tracks in your VST host, and linking them together by selecting one of  the \n   thirty-two build-in virtual buses.  \n             \n   You will be able to make  a stereo side-chaining setup just by  loading two \n   instances  of the  VST plugin  on 2  stereo tracks  in your  VST host,  and \n   linking them together by selecting  one of the thirty-two build-in  virtual \n   buses.    \n             \n             \n             \n   Features  \n   --------\n          \n   32 stereo virtual buses for internal side-chain routing. \n             \n   Input and/or output  filtering, select a  frequency bandwidth to  apply the \n   compression on. \n             \n   Stereo (un)linking, for expressive stereo ducking &amp; keying effects. \n             \n   Switch between 'keying' and 'ducking' (inverting the compression effect). \n             \n   Multiple audio input and output meters  to make a side-chain setup as  easy \n   as possible. \n             \n   Sidechain gain &amp; Threshold control. \n             \n   Compression ratio, attack &amp; release control.
