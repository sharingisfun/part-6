This \r\ntitle doesn't have the color bleeds that every other release does. \r\nAs mentioned, high gen tape was used to complete the main source \r\nbut Tangerine maintains it's color through the whole song (all of \r\nprevious titles not). Unlike Toasted Condor's &quot;Heavy Metal Machine&quot;, \r\nthis new effort from EV uses superb sounding stereo soundboard \r\nsoundtrack to provide the most professional status. Definitely a \r\ngreat discovery and one of few Empress Valley releases dedicated \r\nto every Led Zeppelin fan, not only hard collector. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n01 - Introduction By Alan 'Fluff' Freeman\r\n02 - Rock And Roll\r\n03 - Sick Again\r\n04 - Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n05 - In My Time Of Dying\r\n06 - The Song Remains The Same\r\n07 - The Rain Song\r\n08 - Kashmir\r\n09 - No Quarter\r\n10 - Tangerine\r\n11 - Going To California\r\n12 - That's The Way\r\n13 - Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\r\n14 - Trampled Underfoot\r\n15 - Moby Dick\r\n16 - Dazed And Confused (inc.

The initial string of numbers are \r\nhigh powered and aggressive! No Quarter is a really great jam and the \r\nacoustic section is pretty good. Moby Dick and Dazed are rather boring \r\nhowever, which is sad and rather unfitting as it is the last ever \r\nperformance of the latter. Stairway To Heaven was dedicated to Plant's \r\ndaughter: &quot;Carmen - this song's to a little girl who sits probably \r\nwondering what it all about ... so, where is the bridge? Well, Carmen, \r\nwere's your chance to find out where the bridge is ... and if you know, \r\nplease let me know after the show.&quot; The solo is wonderful and the encores \r\ncontain a tortured Theremin solo from Jimmy before the extra songs are \r\nplayed for the last night's sake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0886e5de84dc8005d95a7571b0c4591304f051","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Demand+Unprecedented+1975.05.25+Region+Free+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0886e5de84dc8005d95a7571b0c4591304f051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,8,134,229,222,132,220,128,5,217,90,117,113,176,196,89,19,4,240,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
