The band's name is the Icelandic word for crepuscular rays.\n\nContents\n\n    1 History\n    2 Band members\n        2.1 Current members\n        2.2 Former members\n    3 Discography\n        3.1 Albums\n    4 References\n    5 External links\n\nHistory\n\nSÃƒÂ³lstafir were formed by 3 friends, AÃƒÂ°albjÃƒÂ¶rn Tryggvason, HalldÃƒÂ³r Einarsson and GuÃƒÂ°mundur Ãƒâ€œli PÃƒÂ¡lmason in January 1995. Later that year, the band recorded its first demo tape Ãƒï¿½ NorÃƒÂ°ri and at the end of the year recorded their second demo, Til Valhallar. Til Valhallar was never released as a demo, and four of the six songs were released as an EP by View Beyond Records. It was later re-released in 2002 with all six songs.\n\nIn 1999 SÃƒÂ³lstafir entered the studio to record their debut full length album. By that time HalldÃƒÂ³r had left the band and in 1997 and 1998 SÃƒÂ³lstafir released two promos as a two piece. For the recording of the debut full length SÃƒÂ³lstafir recruited Svavar Austmann as HalldÃƒÂ³rÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s replacement. Although the recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½ BlÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ°i og AndaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ had started in 1999 the album was not released until 2002, due to endless delays and mishaps, the band truly believed they were cursed. In the meantime SÃƒÂ³lstafir started playing live shows in Iceland, and for that had added a second guitar player, SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³r MarÃƒÂ­us SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³rsson. So for the first time as a four piece, SÃƒÂ³lstafir recorded a new demo in 2002, eventually releasing 3 songs as Black Death: The EP.\n\nIn 2004 the band began working on the follow up to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½ BlÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ°i og AndaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on their own with the help of a good friend. Although SÃƒÂ³lstafir were becoming a well known name in the European metal underground the band found themselves without a recording label. Thus, the band decided to release 3 of the songs from the album as a limited edition promo to send around to labels. This, and a gig in Denmark (the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first outside of Iceland) ensured the band a deal with Spikefarm Records, a sub-label of Spinefarm Records.\n\nSÃƒÂ³lstafir released Ã¢â‚¬Å“Masterpiece of BitternessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ through Spinefarm in 2005. The album got exceptionally good reviews almost everywhere and the band kept on making a good name for themselves with powerful live performances.\n\nIn December 2007 the band traveled to GÃƒÂ¶teborg, Sweden to record their third full length, Ã¢â‚¬Å“KÃƒÂ¶ld.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“KÃƒÂ¶ldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in early 2009 and like Ã¢â‚¬Å“MasterpieceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it not only got exceptionally good reviews, but most critics also had a hard time putting SÃƒÂ³lstafirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music into a specific genre. Descriptions like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sounds Like The Hellacopters if they went to art school and did a lot of ValiumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imagine if Nachtmystium, Alice In Chains, and Neurosis got hammered while listening to EntombedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DCLXVI - To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak The Truth - it would sound something like thisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sigur RÃƒÂ³s goes metal!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were becoming really common.\n\nMeanwhile SÃƒÂ³lstafir kept getting equally as good reviews for their live shows all across mainland Europe and have played on many of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest festivals including Roskilde Festival, Wacken Open Air, Summer-Breeze Open Air, Party San Open Air, Hole in the Sky Festival etc.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ SÃƒÂ³lstafir have also done two full European tours in 2009 and 2010 as well as a few shorter ones.\n\nSÃƒÂ³lstafirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 4th full length album, entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Svartir SandarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released on Season of Mist 14 October 2011 in Europe, and 18 October in the USA. The album got exceptionally good reviews and was voted album of the year in a few esteemed publications such as FinlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest metal magazine, Inferno, GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Metal.de and IcelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest newspaper MorgunblaÃƒÂ°iÃƒÂ°. It was also voted the best heavy album of the year in FinlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest music magazine, Soundi. For the first time SÃƒÂ³lstafir also entered the charts, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Svartir SandarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ topped at no. 7 in Iceland and at no. 11 in Finland. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“FjaraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also entered the single charts and topped at no. 1 in Iceland.\nBand members\nCurrent members                                                              1. \tLÃƒÂ¡gnÃƒÂ¦tti \t08:44 \t \n2. \tÃƒâ€œtta \t09:38 \t \n3. \tRismÃƒÂ¡l \t04:24 \t \n4. \tDagmÃƒÂ¡l \t05:39 \t \n5. \tMiÃƒÂ°degi \t04:18 \t \n6. \tNÃƒÂ³n \t07:47 \t \n7. \tMiÃƒÂ°aftann \t05:39 \t \n8. \tNÃƒÂ¡ttmÃƒÂ¡l \t11:15 \t \n  \t57:24 \t \n\n    Svavar &quot;Svabbi&quot; Austmann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    GuÃƒÂ°mundur Ãƒâ€œli PÃƒÂ¡lmason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³r MarÃƒÂ­us &quot;PjÃƒÂºddi&quot; SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³rsson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    AÃƒÂ°albjÃƒÂ¶rn &quot;Addi&quot; Tryggvason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\n\nFormer members\n\n    HalldÃƒÂ³r Einarsson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nseed if you keep....................................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f3137091906bbda28a2eef5f598d92bb01e45e8","amp;dn":"Solstafir+-+Otta++mp3++320k++a2k++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f3137091906bbda28a2eef5f598d92bb01e45e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,49,55,9,25,6,187,218,40,162,238,245,245,152,217,43,176,30,69,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
