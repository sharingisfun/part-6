Wind up everyone who knows you by singing \nEric the half a bee repetitvely for days. \n\nThis CD is so funny, even better than I thought it would be. \nI recomend having it in the car so other road users think you have a \nmental disorder due to uncontrolable laughter on the road! \n\n_____________________\n\n\n 1.
