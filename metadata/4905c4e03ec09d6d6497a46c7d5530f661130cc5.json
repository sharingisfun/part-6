My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)\n\n\n\nCollectibles reissued Tommy Tutone's first two albums, Tommy Tutone and Tommy Tutone 2, on this 1997 CD. It essentially acts as a greatest-hits collection, since it contains all of their big hits, but it also contains the majority of their best album tracks, thereby making it a definitive career overview. (Quote from Allmusic)\n\nEven if you were NOT a teenager in the 80's like I was, if you like basic rock 'n' roll, I think you'll enjoy BOTH of the albums. Everyone knows the 867-5309/Jenny song, but I feel the 'Angel Say No' song is MUCH better, and the other songs on the albums are also GREAT! I've also added a GREAT sound-track song the band made for the movie 'The Last American Virgin' - &quot;Teen Angel Eyes&quot;. Please enjoy, and please seed/share. ;D\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4905c4e03ec09d6d6497a46c7d5530f661130cc5","amp;dn":"Tommy+Tutone%5C%27s+First+AND+Second+Albums%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4905c4e03ec09d6d6497a46c7d5530f661130cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,5,196,224,62,192,157,109,100,151,164,108,125,85,48,246,97,19,12,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
