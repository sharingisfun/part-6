The arrival of Chinese food on American shores injected a refreshing air of diversity to a country long dominated by Anglo culinary monotony that many have lamented since the nineteenth century. By 1980, Chinese food had become the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular ethnic cuisine. The spread of Chinese restaurants facilitated a quiet but revolutionary change that enriched AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s palate. More important, it marked the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s socioeconomic transformation, turning dining out into a democratic experience. A thoroughly researched, highly readable account of the development of Chinese American food, this book fills important gaps in the literature of ethnic and food studies, while incorporating an appealing personal memoir into the narrative.\n\nAbout the Author\nYong Chen, raised by his food-loving mother in China, is professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, and served as the institution's associate dean of graduate studies. Among his numerous publications are Chinese San Francisco, 1850--1943: A Trans-Pacific Community. He co-curated a museum exhibit on the history of Chinese restaurants in the United States, and his commentaries on food, immigration, and Sino-American relations appear frequently in the media in four languages.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface: The Genesis of the Book \nAcknowledgments      \nIntroduction: Chop Suey, the Big Mac of the Pre-McDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Era \n1.
