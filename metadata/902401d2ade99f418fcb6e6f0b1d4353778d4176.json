It includes hardcore sex, such as the use of sex toys, lesbian sex, and sexual intercourse between men and women.\n \nThere are also a series of DVDs and an official website produced under the Swank name.\n\nThe Magna Publishing Group bought Swank along with other titles, including Stag, in 1993 from Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Goodman, the son of Martin Goodman, founder of Marvel Comics. According to The New York Times, Stag and Swank &quot;can even draw a line to the same pulp publishing outfitÃ¢â‚¬â€Martin Goodman's Magazine Management CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â€that in 1939 started the comic book publisher that eventually became Marvel Comics, and that in the 1950s and 1960s employed future novelists like Mario Puzo and Bruce Jay Friedman as writers and editors.&quot; Beat poet John Fles also wrote for the magazine.\n \nAt the time Magna purchased the magazines from Goodman, the company was known as Swank Publications, and was a part of the GCR Publishing Group, which also published non-pornographic magazines, including such titles as New Body and Victorian Accents.\n \nThe Magna Publishing Group's website includes the claim that Swank has been established for &quot;well over 65 years.&quot; A men's-lifestyle magazine called Swank was founded by Fox Comics founder Victor Fox in the 1940s, and eventually evolved to its modern format. The magazine had breaks in publication of several years during its history\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.swankmag.com/tours/?nats=fslfsl.38.24.24.1.0.0.0.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.swankmag.com/tours/?nats=fslfsl.38.24.24.1.0.0.0.0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902401d2ade99f418fcb6e6f0b1d4353778d4176","amp;dn":"Swank+Magazine+Collection+PDF+Megapack+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902401d2ade99f418fcb6e6f0b1d4353778d4176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,36,1,210,173,233,159,65,143,203,110,111,11,29,67,83,119,141,65,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
