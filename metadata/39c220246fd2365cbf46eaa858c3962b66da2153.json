In addition to his work with Pink Floyd, Gilmour has worked as a producer for a variety of artists, and has enjoyed a successful career as a solo artist. Gilmour has been actively involved with many charities over the course of his career. In 2003, he was appointed CBE for services to music and philanthropy and was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards.[2] Rolling Stone magazine put him at #82 on its list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time and described as &quot;one of rock's most distinctive guitarists&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive in Gdansk 2008\n\n\n\nLive in GdaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾sk is a live album by David Gilmour. It is a part of his On an Island project which includes an album, tour, DVD, and live album. It was released on 22 September 2008. A David Gilmour Signature Series Fender Stratocaster was released at the same time.\n\nIt is a recording of the final show of his On an Island tour in 2006, where he played to an audience of 50,000 at the GdaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾sk Shipyard to celebrate the founding of the Solidarity trade union.\n\nThe show featured the song A Great Day for Freedom, which appears on Pink Floyd's final studio album The Division Bell from 1994.
