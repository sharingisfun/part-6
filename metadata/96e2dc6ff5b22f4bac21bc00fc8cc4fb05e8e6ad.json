Narrative epiphanies and interior monologue frame the life of Joana, from her middle-class childhood through her unhappy marriage and its dissolution to transcendence, when she proclaims: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I shall arise as strong and comely as a young colt.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Passion According to G.H.\nThe Passion According to G.H., Clarice LispectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mystical novel of 1964, concerns a well-to-do Rio sculptress, G.H., who enters her maidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room, sees a cockroach crawling out of the wardrobe, and, panicking, slams the door Ã¢â‚¬â€crushing the cockroach Ã¢â‚¬â€and then watches it die. At the end of the novel, at the height of a spiritual crisis, comes the most famous and most genuinely shocking scene in Brazilian literature Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Lispector wrote that of all her works this novel was the one that Ã¢â‚¬Å“best corresponded to her demands as a writer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Hour of the Star\nNarrated by the cosmopolitan Rodrigo S.M., this brief, strange, and haunting tale is the story of MacabÃƒÂ©a, one of life's unfortunates. Living in the slums of Rio and eking out a poor living as a typist, MacabÃƒÂ©a loves movies, Coca-Colas, and her rat of a boyfriend; she would like to be like Marilyn Monroe, but she is ugly, underfed, sickly and unloved. Rodrigo recoils from her wretchedness, and yet he cannot avoid the realization that for all her outward misery, MacabÃƒÂ©a is inwardly free/She doesn't seem to know how unhappy she should be. Lispector employs her pathetic heroine against her urbane, empty narratorÃ¢â‚¬â€edge of despair to edge of despairÃ¢â‚¬â€and, working them like a pair of scissors, she cuts away the reader's preconceived notions about poverty, identity, love and the art of fiction. In her last book she takes readers close to the true mystery of life and leave us deep in Lispector territory indeed.\n\nAgua Viva\nThis rarefied novel adopts the form of the interior monologue characteristic of Lispector's (1925-1977) oeuvre. A woman sits by the open window of her Brazilian beachfront studio, writing a long letter to someone no more specific than &quot;you.&quot; She parries with language (which is &quot;only words which live off sound&quot;) and is wholly consumed with problems of epistemology: &quot;I want to die with life.&quot; A painter, she struggles as well to recreate the world around her: &quot;On certain nights, instead of black, the sky seems to be an intense indigo blue, a color I've painted on glass.&quot; When she listens to music, she says, &quot;I rest my hand lightly on the turntable and my hand vibrates, spreading waves through my whole body.&quot; While the narrator's self-consciousness (&quot;And if I say 'I,' it's because I don't dare say 'you,' or 'we,' or 'a person.' I'm limited to the humble act of self-personalization through reducing myself, but I am the 'you-are.' &quot;) and diction (&quot;the ultimate substratum in the domain of reality&quot;) may strike some readers as academic, others will appreciate the challenges of Lispector's philosophical investigations. \n\nA Breath of Life\nA mystical dialogue between a male author (a thinly disguised Clarice Lispector) and his/her creation, a woman named Angela, this posthumous work has never before been translated. Lispector did not even live to see it published.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e2dc6ff5b22f4bac21bc00fc8cc4fb05e8e6ad","amp;dn":"5+Novels+by+Clarice+Lispector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e2dc6ff5b22f4bac21bc00fc8cc4fb05e8e6ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,226,220,111,245,178,47,75,172,33,188,0,252,140,196,251,5,232,230,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
