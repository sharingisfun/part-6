This is a rip, people, copy the relevant folders into your FSX directory and enjoy.\n\nAlmost all aircraft designed for a COIN (counter-insurgency) are great fun to fly. They have to be sturdy and have loads of power to get out of trouble and they also got to agile and easy to fly low to the ground. So they all are the opposite of airliners that draw straight lines high in the sky, they feel most at ease when the hug the ground and pull G. The OV-10 Bronco is perhaps the finest example of this class of aircraft.\n\nThe Bronco has its roots deep in the 1960s when most military aircraft were getting bigger, more complex and above all faster. These aircraft did not work well in harsh conditions found in jungles and even on carrier decks. The OV-10 Bronco was the opposite. It was simple and rugged and could land on grass fields and even carriers.  These days their fighting role is over but they are popular aircraft at airshows where their unusual layout and smooth aerobatics make them welcome guests. \n\nThe Aerosoft OV-10 Bronco X was created with the help from people who still fly them, the OV-10 Bronco Association, German Wing.  We created the aircraft very much as they feel it should be done, as an aircraft that is incredibly fun to fly. We also decided it was a great way to do an aircraft that has simple systems done to a high degree of fidelity. If you master the engines of the Bronco at the high realism setting you really understand them. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the same with the electrical and fuel system. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an ideal aircraft to take up for a half an hour flight as it is easy. But to fully master the systems and calling yourself a \\&quot;Bronco driver\\&quot; will take some time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    8 models (US Air Force, US marines, NASA, German Wing of the OV-10 Bronco Association) \n    Some of the best 3D modelling ever done for FSX, using the latest tools and insights\n    Highly realistic modelled Garret T-76 (Honeywell TPE331) engines (we think this is the best representation of turboprops in FS so far\n    Realistic start-up sequence with propeller start-latches and engine instrument readouts\n    Realistic in-air restarts possible (normally not possible in FSX)\n    Realistic engine wear\n    Custom propeller animations\n    Hot and hung starts (clearing engine after a hung start possible)\n    Engine failures due to over torque or overheat\n    Engine flameouts due to icing when not using continuous ignition\n    Working fire extinguishers\n    Electrical system fully custom coded with electrical load calculated for every consumer\n    All aircraft lights are dependent on correct electrical setup\n    Gauge needles vibrate due to uneven ground and aircraft vibrations\n    Airspeed gauge needle vibrates close to stall speed\n    Lots of animations like oil cooler doors, Ram door, canopy, windscreen wiper etc.\n    Smoke effects for engine fire, hung engine and smoke generator on left engine\n    Fully working TACAN radio and additional modern COM2 radio\n    Fully functional Becker BXP 6401 transponder\n    Custom developed GPS with,  map mode, direct to mode, cursor mode, nearest station mode, hsi mode\n    Unique Checklist Gauge with the option to let the checklist do the required actions\n    Engineer station gauge to visualise the electrical system state\n    Hundreds of nonstandard sounds, you will even hear the airframe groan when it is under G-load\n    Created with the great support of the OV-10 Bronco Association, German Wing\n    Highly realistic flight mechanics (several test flights were done in the real aircraft to verify the simulated model).  Even includes realistic stalls, spins and the dreaded Dutch roll behaviour\n    Highly optimized for the best possible framerate. Most gauges are in the modeldef.xml and there is only one VC section defined\n    High detail Paint Kits\n    Aerosoft Launcher optional, no online registration necessary\n    Compatible with Lockheed Martin - Prepar3D\n\n\n \nPlease visit my thread in the Suprbay forums.
