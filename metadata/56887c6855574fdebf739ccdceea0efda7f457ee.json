In December 2013, Muse released a live album and video, Live at Rome Olympic Stadium; songwriter Matthew Bellamy said the band wanted the live album &quot;to capture some of the extremes of what we've been doing since we want to go in a different direction in the future.&quot;\n\nMuse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert. Bellamy stated that the album &quot;should be something that really does strip away the additional things that we've experimented with on the last two albums... I kind of feel like it will be nice to reconnect and remind ourselves of just the basics of who we are&quot;.\n\nIn October 2014, Muse entered The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver in order to record the material they had written. After their last two albums were both self-produced, Muse decided to work with producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange on Drones. The first recording session ended on 19 October, with the band calling it &quot;emotional&quot;. Muse re-entered the studio in November 2014. On 1 April 2015, drummer Dominic Howard and mixer Rich Costey indicated on their Instagram accounts that they had finished mixing the album.\nThemes\n\n\nOn 26 January 2015, Muse revealed the album title in an Instagram video featuring a mixing desk with audio samples and a screen stating &quot;Artist - Muse, Album - Drones.&quot; Muse began using the hashtag &quot;#MuseDrones&quot; on Twitter and Instagram. On 8 March, the band shared a snippet of a new song, &quot;Psycho&quot;, and mentioned &quot;mixing with a very tight deadline&quot;\n\nOn 12 March, Muse released a lyric video for &quot;Psycho&quot; on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for download with the album pre-order.From 15 to 24 March, the band played the Psycho UK Tour, six concerts in small venues in the UK.
