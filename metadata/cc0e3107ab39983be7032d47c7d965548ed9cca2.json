Jones issued his first solo release, Nowhere Else But Here in 2000 after moving to Nashville, TN to pursue music full-time.\n\nIn 2006 he released the album Throwing Punches in the Dark. This album, produced by Neilson Hubbard (Glen Phillips, Garrison Starr), is a departure from his previous Folk/Americana sound to something more Pop Rock. Throwing Punches in the Dark has been well received by critics and fans alike.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007 Matthew was asked to perform at the historic Alabama Theatre in Birmingham, AL for the 10 year celebration of the syndicated radio program, Reg's Coffee House. Matthew shared the stage with Stoll Vaughan, Jim James (My Morning Jacket) and Patty Griffin.\n\nIn 2008, Matthew has teamed up again with producer Neilson Hubbard to produce a new LP entitled Swallow the Sea which, according to his MySpace blog, is named after one of the ten songs included on the album. The album was released August 19, 2008[2].\n\nMatthew is currently on tour with Ingrid Michaelson.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0e3107ab39983be7032d47c7d965548ed9cca2","amp;dn":"Matthew+Perryman+Jones+Swallow+The+Sea+Advance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0e3107ab39983be7032d47c7d965548ed9cca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,14,49,7,171,57,152,59,231,3,45,71,199,217,101,84,142,217,204,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
