In his search for the truth behind the brutal killings, Borubaev hits a wall of silence, with no one to turn to outside his sometime lover, the beautiful and lethal undercover security service agent Saltanat Umarova.\r\nWhen Borubaev himself is framed for the production of blood-soaked child pornography connected with the case, it looks as though things couldnâ€™t get any worse. With the investigation at a dangerous standstill, Borubaev sets out to save his integrity, and to deliver his own savage brand of justice on behalf of the many dead who canâ€™t speak for themselves . . .\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c8a0e46eac2ba570389af32b02bb82d8b9c1cf","amp;dn":"A+Spring+Betrayal+-+Tom+Callaghan+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c8a0e46eac2ba570389af32b02bb82d8b9c1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,200,160,228,110,172,43,165,112,56,154,243,43,2,187,130,216,185,193,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
