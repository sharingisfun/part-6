When AbbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private school notifies him that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be expelled unless Danny pays his astronomical tuition bill, he dreads forcing more change in AbbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. So, Danny thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dodged an emotional bullet when he accepts a loan from Thomas Galvin, father of AbbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. But, before relief sinks in, Danny is summoned to an undercover DEA office and informed that the loan implicates him in their case against Galvin, a money-launderer for the Sinaloa drug cartel. Danny can either work undercover or face indictment, and a public indictment will alert chainsaw-wielding cartel enforcers. Danny takes the DEAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deal, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no 007, and every moment undercover is torture.\n\n\nRead by Steve Kearney\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nLength: 10 hrs 16 min\nRelease Date: 05-27-14\nPublisher: Penguin Audio\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4a7f74f0091804db5df1066e64e1990daf6008","amp;dn":"Joseph+Finder+-+Suspicion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4a7f74f0091804db5df1066e64e1990daf6008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,74,127,116,240,9,24,4,219,93,241,6,110,100,225,153,13,175,96,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
