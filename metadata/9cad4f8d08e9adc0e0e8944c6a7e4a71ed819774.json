Launched on February 11, 2010, SDO keeps a 24-hour eye on teh entire disk of The Sun, with a prime view of hte graceful dance of solar material coursing through The Sun's atmosphere, the corona.\r\n\r\nSDO captures images of The Sun in 10 different wavelengths, each of which helps highlight a different temperature of solar material. Different temperatures can, in turn, show specific structures on The Sun such as solar flares, which are gigantic explosions of light and x-rays, or coronal loops, which are stream of solar material travelling up and down looping magnetic field lines.\r\n\r\nScientists study these images to better understand the complex electromagnetic system causing the constant movement on The Sun, which can ultimately have an effect closer to Earth, too. Flares and another type of solar explosion called coronal mass ejections can sometimes disrupt technology in space. Moreover, studying our closest star is one way of learning about other stars in the galaxy. NASA's Goddard Space \r\n\r\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Md. built, operates, and manages the SDO spacecraft for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nCredit: The SDO Team, Genna Duberstein and Scott Wiessinger.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CAVLC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: ~15.8Mbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 3840x2160\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 29.97 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.5 VBR 48KHz (~176Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 30 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 3.40 GB\r\nSource: Webrip\r\nEncoded by: NASA\r\nMD5 Hash: 7d51c51899cf8f94aa50fc7448809b5c\r\n\r\nThis file uses the Youtube 4K video and NASA's 320Kbps AAC audio as the sources.\r\nHigher spec video is available at the NASA website","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cad4f8d08e9adc0e0e8944c6a7e4a71ed819774","amp;dn":"Thermonuclear+Art%3A+The+Sun+in+4K+PROPER+2160p+h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cad4f8d08e9adc0e0e8944c6a7e4a71ed819774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,173,79,141,8,233,173,192,224,232,148,76,106,126,74,113,237,129,151,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
