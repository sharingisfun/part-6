The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the episode is loud and not too loud when the episode is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\n\nNote for the Rifftrax audio tracks - audio1, 2.0 Riff - the Rifftrax intro comments run longer than the video running time. The picture is just black during this final audio part.
