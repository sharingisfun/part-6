Installation\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer (also known as anaconda) assists in the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 includes the following enhancements:\n\nA kickstart installation, by default, has the SSH port open in the firewall settings. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7, the new &quot;--no-ssh&quot; kickstart option for the firewall command can be used to ensure that SSH access to a system is disabled.\nThe new blacklist functionality in anaconda is used to avoid the installation or probing of drivers.\nanaconda provides added support for the subscription and entitlement changes implemented in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7. Refer to Section 2, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSubscriptions and EntitlementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for further information.\n\n2. Subscriptions and Entitlement\nEffective software and infrastructure management requires a mechanism to handle the software inventory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both the type of products and the number of systems that the software is installed on.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7,includes support for the new Entitlement Platform which provides oversight for the software entitlements for an organization and a more effective content delivery system. On local systems, the new Red Hat Subscription Manager offers both GUI and command-line tools to manage the local system and its allocated subscriptions.\nA better method to handle subscriptions will help our customers maintain their software compliance and will make installing and updating Red Hat products much simpler.\nNote\nFor more information refer to the Overview of changes to Red Hat subscription and entitlement management article on the Red Hat Knowledgebase.\n3. Virtualization\n3.1. Xen\nXen is a high performance and secure open source virtualization framework.
