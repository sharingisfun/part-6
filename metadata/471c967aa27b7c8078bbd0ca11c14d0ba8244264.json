That&amp;#039;s followed by dramatic feature about a dejected teenager who doesn&amp;#039;t make the cut at a high school basketball team tryout but who winds up, as if by magic, getting coaching from Jordan himself. Pertinent clips from Jordan&amp;#039;s college and pro career illustrate particular points as he delivers lessons about determination and &quot;heart.&quot; Some of Jordan&amp;#039;s teammates and illustrious opponents also appear in interview segments to talk about his fierce will to win. Rounding out Michael Jordan&amp;#039;s Playground is a music video, in which Jordan even does a little dancing. This video is always entertaining, and chances are it would be helpful as a motivational tool for a young player.\n\nGeneral\nComplete name        : Michael jordan playgroundMichael jordan playground.avi\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 549 MiB\nPlayTime             : 42mn 58s\nBit rate             : 1777 Kbps\nWriting library      : VirtualDub build 10805/release\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : DivX 3 Low\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec settings/Packe : No\nPlayTime             : 42mn 58s\nBit rate             : 1668 Kbps\nWidth                : 512 pixels\nHeight               : 384 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 4/3\nFrame rate           : 29.970 fps\nResolution           : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.283\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nPlayTime             : 42mn 58s\nBit rate             : 96 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\nVideo0 delay         : 16ms\nWriting library      : Xing (old)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471c967aa27b7c8078bbd0ca11c14d0ba8244264","amp;dn":"Michael+Jordan%60s+Playground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471c967aa27b7c8078bbd0ca11c14d0ba8244264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,28,150,122,162,123,124,128,120,187,208,202,17,193,77,11,168,36,66,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
