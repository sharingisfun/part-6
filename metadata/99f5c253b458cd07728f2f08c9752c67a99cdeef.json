Our thorough knowledge of your equipment allows DxO Optics Pro to provide you with the best tools and the most precise settings for unparalleled sharpness and beauty in your photos\n\nRigorous optical corrections\n\nDxO Optics Pro corrects precisely and with an unrivaled level of quality all the optical flaws in your images (RAW and JPEG) such as distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberrations. DxOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s totally unique library of thousands of DxO Optics Modules precisely fits each correction to every single image. Generated using an exclusive calibration process for each combination of cameras and lenses, DxO Optics Modules contain tens of thousands of data about the intrinsic flaws of each camera and lens. A DxO Labs exclusive.\n\nLens softness\n\nWith its exclusive Lens softness tool, DxO Optics Pro automatically sharpens photos (RAW and JPG). Image sharpness is improved and homogenized from the center to the photo edges. The results are even more dramatic with RAW-format photos. Local-content photo analysis technology offers you flawless images, even when pushing settings to the max. DxO Optics Pro also preserves the bokeh, avoiding artifacts that can appear in homogenous or deliberately out-of-focus zones.\n\nLight and contrast optimization\n\nRestore the ideal balance between the dark and light zones in your images. New, exclusive DxO Smart Lighting intelligently reveals your photos details under different lighting conditions, including under- or overexposure. Light and contrast are locally as well as globally optimized for a perfect rendering. Set your hand on a unique intensity slider to globally refine final rendering and make subtle improvements. Want to go further? Use the Selective Tone tool to precisely and separately handle highlights, midtones, and shadows.\n\nThe HDR mono-image tool provides the final touch, revealing tons of details in burnt or dark zones.\n\nExceptional denoising\n\nGive up your flash with DxO Optics Pro! Restore the full emotional impact of your night shots and obtain detailed textures with incomparable colors. Based on meticulous calibration in our laboratories, DxO Optics ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurpassed denoising tool has been designed to support all cameras, including yours, thus automatically eliminating the digital noise from all your images.\n\nRAW conversion\n\nDxO Optics Pro provides you with incomparable image quality, thanks to its RAW converter based on careful and thorough characterization of cameras just like yours. Optimized for RAW format, DxO Optics Pro provides extremely fine adjustments to your photos in a non-destructive manner. Master your image rendering by precisely adjusting white balance, details, and colors in your photos. Save your settings as custom presets to easily apply them to batches of images later.\n\nColor management\n\nRestore the brilliant colors of your images thanks to DxO Optics ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful correction tools.
