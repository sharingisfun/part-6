When the boys hear about a strange traveling carnival from a lightning rod salesman, they decide to see what it is all about-but Will is fearful, as most carnivals end their tours after Labor Day. When the ominous Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man, rides into town on a dark midnight, setting up his massive carnival in a matter of seconds, the boys are both thrilled and terrified. It seems to be just another carnival at first, but it is not before long that the forces of darkness themselves are manifesting from the haunting melodies of the carousel-which can change your age depending on which way you ride it-and the glaring Mirror Maze.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c20160a684170b72dee3d33be6a3032f475a35","amp;dn":"Disney%27s+Something+Wicked+This+Way+Comes+1983.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c20160a684170b72dee3d33be6a3032f475a35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,194,1,96,166,132,23,11,114,222,227,211,59,230,163,3,47,71,90,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
