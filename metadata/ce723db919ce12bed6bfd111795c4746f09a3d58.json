Each recipe tackles a specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe works.\n\nMost of the recipes use the ggplot2 package, a powerful and flexible way to make graphs in R. If you have a basic understanding of the R language, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to get started.\n\n- Use RÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default graphics for quick exploration of data\n- Create a variety of bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots\n- Summarize data distributions with histograms, density curves, box plots, and other examples\n- Provide annotations to help viewers interpret data\n- Control the overall appearance of graphics\n- Render data groups alongside each other for easy comparison\n- Use colors in plots\n- Create network graphs, heat maps, and 3D scatter plots\n- Structure data for graphing\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
