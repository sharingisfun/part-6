There she \nmeets a hearty housekeeper and her spirited brother, a dour gardener, a cheerful \nrobin, and her willful, hysterical, and sickly cousin, Master Colin. With the \nhelp of the robin, Mary finds the door to a secret garden, neglected and hidden \nfor years. When she decides to restore the garden in secret, the story becomes a \ncharming journey into the places of the heart where faith restores health, \nflowers refresh the spirit, and the magic of the garden coming to life anew \nbrings to Colin health and to Mary happiness.\n\n\n&quot;It will rapt most children away, for after fifty years its spell is still as \nstrong; a blend of power, beauty, vivid interest and honest goodness. Yes, if \nthis is magic, it is good magic.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“New York Times Book Review\n\n&quot;For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, The Secret Garden's \nportrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson \nBurnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to \nidentify with them even eighty-five years after they were conceived.&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Amazon.com Review\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd843f2133870969ffbb2ce9e0efe528fd612994","amp;dn":"THE+SECRET+GARDEN+-+Frances+Hodgson+Burnett.+Ward+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd843f2133870969ffbb2ce9e0efe528fd612994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,132,63,33,51,135,9,105,255,187,44,233,224,239,229,40,253,97,41,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
