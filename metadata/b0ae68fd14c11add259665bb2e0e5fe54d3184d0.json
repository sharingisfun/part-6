He often sits in on the program when third-mic Jimmy Norton is away.\n\nBeginning in March 2006, Oneal began hosting an uncensored relationship advice show on XM Satellite Radio. He hosts the program on select Saturday nights when he is not performing stand-up. The three-hour program became known as &quot;The Black Phillip Show&quot;, in a parody of Dr. Phil's show. The show runs on XM's The Virus. Dante Nero co-hosts, and a rotating cast of female comedians have played third mic.\n\nThis is every Black Phillip show I could find, from March '06 June '08 - 13 episodes (365 MB) in 24k commercial-free mp3 (the last 6 are 32k).
