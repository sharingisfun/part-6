About the gigs in Land of the Rising Sun vocalist Klaus Meine said: The screaming and shouting was incredible. It was total star-cult.\n\nThese shows were guitarist Uli Jon Roth's last performances with the band. He had announced his departure after the release of the preceding album &quot;Taken by Force&quot; and bid an impressive farewell with &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot;.\n\n&quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot; includes songs from all Scorpions' albums, released before 1978. The group delivering brilliant versions of hits like &quot;In Trance&quot;, &quot;Pictured Life&quot;, &quot;Speedy's Coming&quot;, &quot;He's a Woman - She's a Man&quot; or &quot;We'll Burn the Sky&quot; and new song &quot;All Night Long&quot;, which wasn't release on any Scorps' studio album.\n\nThe songs &quot;Hell-Cat&quot;, &quot;Catch Your Train&quot; and the Japanese national anthem (&quot;Kimi ga yo&quot;) were also performed during these shows but were not included in the official album. On the 2001 EMI re-mastered CD, &quot;Polar Nights&quot; was disappointingly omitted so as to fit a single CD, although it was included on the re-mastered version of &quot;Taken by Force&quot;.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Klaus Meine - Lead Vocals\n    * Ulrich Roth - Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals, Lead Vocals on &quot;Polar Nights&quot;, &quot;Fly To The Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Dark Lady&quot;\n    * Rudolf Schenker - Rhythm Guitar, Backing Vocals\n    * Francis Buchholz - Bass, Backing Vocals\n    * Herman Rarebell - Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ebea8da40930dd790b56f02187eade0479d5456","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+%5C%27Tokyo+Tapes%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ebea8da40930dd790b56f02187eade0479d5456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,190,168,218,64,147,13,215,144,181,111,2,24,126,173,224,71,157,84,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
