They are characterized by their irreverent approach to music. Primus release their records on Claypool's Prawn Song Records label, a parody of Led Zeppelin's Swan Song.\nContents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f7665d634a4b510fa7768dc21a4be750199ff4","amp;dn":"Primus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f7665d634a4b510fa7768dc21a4be750199ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,247,102,93,99,74,75,81,15,167,118,141,194,26,75,231,80,25,159,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
