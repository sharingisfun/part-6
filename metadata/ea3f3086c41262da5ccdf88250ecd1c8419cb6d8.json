Certain elements had to be re-recorded in the studio due to technical problems with the live recordings. The original LP release featured three new studio tracks, two of which (&quot;She Is Always Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Love Is Just Another Word&quot;) were omitted from the CD release. &quot;A Better Place to Be&quot; was released as a single, and did manage to crack the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album is popular for its extended cut of &quot;30,000 Pounds of Bananas&quot;, infamous for Chapin's recounting of his brothers' remarks after hearing the original ending: &quot;Harry...it sucks.&quot; The quote became so popular with Harry Chapin fans that concert shirts were sold with the quotation on it.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Dreams Go By\n[02] W*O*L*D\n[03] Saturday Morning\n[04] I Wanna Learn A Love Song\n[05] Mr. Tanner\n[06] Better Place To Be\n[07] Let Time Go Lightly\n[08] Cat's In The Cradle\n[09] Taxi\n[10] Circle\n[11] 30,000 Pounds Of Bananas\n[12] Shortest Story\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:10m:32s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 168mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
