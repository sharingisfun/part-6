The right way takes advantage of the WordPress enqueue system, which prevents script and style conflicts. In this installment of WordPress Developer Tips, staff author Morten Rand-Hendriksen introduces the two main functions for enqueuing: wp_enqueue_style() and wp_enqueue_script(0). He'll show how the functions work and how to adjust their parameters, as well as theoretical and practical examples of implementing them in themes. This course uses Simone, a theme developed especially for Morten's WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores course, but you can use any theme or subtheme that you'd like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ddaec54217befb01fa7383ad550d0b8d40e68d3","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+WordPress+Developer+Tips%3A+Enqueuing+Styles+and+Scripts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ddaec54217befb01fa7383ad550d0b8d40e68d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,218,236,84,33,123,239,176,31,167,56,58,213,80,208,184,212,14,104,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
