This 7 CD set is fantastic, and definitely worth a thorough listen.\n\nThe works on here include:\nAll four of Brahms' symphonies (if you download anything, download the 4th Symphony, it is sublime)\nBoth of Brahms' piano concertos (played by Stephen Kovacevich)\nTragic Overture\nSt. Anthony Variations\nSchicksalslied (Song of Destiny)\nAcademic Festival Overture\nViolin Concerto in D\nMozart's third violin concerto (I don't know why this is on here...)\nDouble Concerto\nHorn Trio in E flat\nTwo Songs Op. 91\n\nI tag my classical music very strictly. See http://www.scene24.net/1203.html for details.\n\nFormat is 256k VBR AAC. This should sync up very nicely with iTunes.\n\nEnjoy!
