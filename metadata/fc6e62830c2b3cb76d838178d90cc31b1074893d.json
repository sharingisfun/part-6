MCT developer Adrian Wells shows that much psychological distress results from how a person responds to negative thoughts and beliefsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for example, by ruminating or worryingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½rather than the content of those thoughts. He presents innovative, practical techniques and specific protocols for addressing metacognitive processes to effectively treat generalized anxiety disorder, obsessiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression. Special features include reproducible treatment plans and assessment and case formulation tools, plus a wealth of illustrative case material.\n\n\n\n*************\n\n\t\n11 of 11 people found the following review helpful:\n5.0 out of 5 stars Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression, March 18, 2009\nBy \tI. Care - See all my reviews\nThis review is from: Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression (Hardcover)\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression. I saw many psychiatrists, psychologists and over 35 years in January 2009 I discovered Metacognitive Therapy and three months later I've reduced my anxiety to normal levels. It's not a miracle, it's a direct benefit of putting together the knowledge from this book and practicing the techniques described. I've contacted my friends with anxiety and/or depression as this is the best resource I've seen to overcome anxious and depressive conditions. \n\nI was intrigued with the book from page one, &quot;Thoughts don't matter, but your response to them does: as everyone has negative thoughts but not everyone believes their negative thoughts and develops anxiety.&quot; I've read the book three times and I've phoned all my friends and family members with anxiety and/or depression to please read this book. \n\nMetacognitive therapy (MCT) does not question the reality of a person's individual thoughts and beliefs; it focuses on how to change a person's response to the thought. It cuts to the chase of the how to overcome anxious thinking and provides the tools to disengage from intrusive thoughts (called mental events) while providing a step by step method of how to reduce anxiety to normal levels. \n\nBefore reading this book, I thought that my worry kept me safe, protected me from danger and I firmly believed it was impossible for me to stop worrying. I worried all day, everyday and half the night. I was existing, not living. Thanks to MCT I now experience anxious thoughts in metacognitive mode and view the thought as an event in the mind and as such, I do not have to pay attention to it resulting in no more worry! I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I hope that MCT becomes better known in the US (the author is from England) as it has the potential to help millions. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6e62830c2b3cb76d838178d90cc31b1074893d","amp;dn":"Metacognitive+Therapy+For+Anxiety+and+Depression","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6e62830c2b3cb76d838178d90cc31b1074893d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,110,98,131,12,43,60,183,109,131,129,120,217,12,195,27,16,116,137,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
