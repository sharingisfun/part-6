Marx not only stood against the global economic system but he also helped us understand it. He explained how wealth was created on the backs of workers, how &quot;surplus value&quot; is realized and how accumulation is achieved through unpaid labour-time, the intensification of work and the tyranny of credit.\n\n&quot;Capital - In Manga!&quot; is the English translation of the Japanese bestseller. It's a story of a cheese-maker turned capitalist and how greed, exploitation and its social consequences destroys lives and remakes workers into commodities.\n\nIt is hoped that this manga may act as a bridge to Marx's original work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10240826d0cb14b712771686bbf3467762adb52","amp;dn":"%5BManga%5D+Karl+Marx+-+Capital+%28Das+Kapital%29+Vol.+I+%26amp%3B+II+%28Engli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10240826d0cb14b712771686bbf3467762adb52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,2,64,130,109,12,177,75,113,39,113,104,107,191,52,103,118,42,219,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
