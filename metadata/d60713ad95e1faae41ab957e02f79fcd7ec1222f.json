It premiered in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. At the premiere, directors Roger Waters and Sean Evans were in attendance and received praise from those in the audience that night.\r\n\r\nRoger Waters is about to launch a tour where a 36-foot-high wall will rise up each night between him and his fans â€“ and right now, you wouldn't blame him for wishing the thing was a bit more portable. The former Pink Floyd leader has just ducked his still-gangly six-foot-three-inch frame into a town car for a ride to a midtown Manhattan restaurant, and it is immediately clear that the driver is way too excited to see him. Waters braces himself. &quot;Been a fan all my life, man,&quot; says the driver, a baseball-capped, middle-aged dude named Fred, with a broad New York accent. &quot;'Wish You Were Here' â€“ I was backpacking in Europe when I got turned on to it. I was like, 'This is the best album evvuh!' It must be an unbelievable feeling to know what an impact you made on my generation.&quot; Absolutely I was in high school when the album first appeared in 1979. And than when the movie come out in 82 I was graduating. So this defined my existence.\r\nGod help us.\r\n\r\nALBUM: The Wall\r\n\r\nYEAR : 2015\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: UK\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Progressive Rock, Art-Rock, Psychedelic Rock\r\n\r\nLABEL: Columbia\r\n\r\nDURATION: 01:43:11\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressive Rock Psychedelic Rock Art rock\r\n\r\nRoger Waters - The Wall (2 CD) (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n\r\n01.
