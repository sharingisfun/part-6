It is preferable to use the current newest program version 3.4.5 (or later, I'd imagine).  Version 3.3.7 should also work fine.\n\n\n\n\n########################################################################\nFrom the Readme.txt file\n########################################################################\n\nGreetings fellow polyglot wannabes (and non-Iranians dreaming for a free and democratic SECULAR Iran!)\n\nI am the original creator of this torrent.\n\n===============================================================================\nFor the past ~2 years the only Rosetta Stone Farsi available for download was levels 1 &amp; 2 for RS v2.1.\nThat version sucked. Its first unit taught you useless words like &quot;elephant&quot;. And it foolishly presented \nrarely used Persian synonyms for everyday words like &quot;car&quot; among other crimes.  Good riddance.\n\nThis torrent includes all 3 currently available MUCH IMPROVED levels for Version 3 of RS.\nIt also includes the Audio Companions associated with these levels.\n\nThe actual Persian (Farsi) CD-ROMS have the following internal disc labels:\n&quot;Farsi_1&quot;\n&quot;Farsi_2&quot;\n&quot;Farsi_3&quot;\n\nThe physical CD-ROM media have the following labels (identical on each disc):\n\t&quot;VERSION 3, v7.4.0.r19&quot;\t\t(which implies version 3.7.4.0.r19)\nAlso, the discs for Level 1, 2, 3 have the following number code near the lower disc edge:\n\t&quot;210#019&quot; (where &quot;#&quot; = level of the disc).\n\nThese discs originally shipped with Rosetta Stone Application: &quot;VERSION 3, v3.3.7A&quot;\n\nSo I would recommend using these dics with that release or preferably version 3.4.5.\nI trust that you already own that software or know how to acquire it!\n\n===============================================================================\nAudio Companions:  4 audio CDs for each of the 3 levels = 12 CDs.\n\nI have converted these all to mono MP3 files at 64kbps (CBR) which is a good norm for voice.\n\nThe original Audio Companion CDs are each labeled as &quot;v1.0&quot; with 2008 copyright.\nAlso, the discs have the following number code near the lower disc edge:\n\n&quot;21070##&quot; where ## is:\n00,01,02,03,04,..11 FOR: L1 U1, L1 U2, L1 U3, L1 U4, L2 U1, ... L3 U4 respectively.\n\n===============================================================================\nLastly, please do buy this software from Rosetta Stone Ltd. if you actually end up using it frequently and \nimproving yourself with its assistance.  That company may have some draconian licensing and asinine \nactivation schemes, but they still deserve some compensation when users utilize their creations.\n===============================================================================\nThank you.\n\nAnd:\nViva the Green Movement!\nMarg bar dictator!\n(that means YOU Ahmadinejad &amp; &quot;Rahbar&quot; Khamenei. + your clerical &amp; military supporters &amp; those ignorant basij thugs!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933a81c882a2addf09452b9dfb1e5ba47de384b3","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+V3+-+Persian+%28Farsi%29+%28L1%2C+L2%2C+L3%29+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933a81c882a2addf09452b9dfb1e5ba47de384b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,58,129,200,130,162,173,223,9,69,43,157,251,30,91,164,125,227,132,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
