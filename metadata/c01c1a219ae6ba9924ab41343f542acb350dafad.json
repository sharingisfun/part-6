This is a technically comprehensive study of the components that constitute a gas turbine aero-engine and examines each part's design and function in practice. Concentrates on turbojet, turboprop and turbofan designs, and is applicable to civilian and military usage. Contains an overview of the main design types and fundamentals, and looks at air intakes, compressors, turbines and exhaust systems in great detail.\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Zenith Press (December 21, 1997)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0760304599\n# ISBN-13: 978-0760304594","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01c1a219ae6ba9924ab41343f542acb350dafad","amp;dn":"Jet+Engines+-+Fundamentals+of+Theory%2C+Design+and+Operations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01c1a219ae6ba9924ab41343f542acb350dafad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,28,26,33,154,230,186,153,36,171,65,52,63,84,42,203,53,13,175,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
