He heads to the beautiful city of Orvieto and meets a winemaker who is making a cool climate pinot noir in Lazio. Chef Stephen Harris shares his love of red burgundy and creates a simple dish to complement it. Matt and Matt are challenged to tell the difference between a 120 pound bottle of French wine and one from Spain that costs just 10. The programme also tells the story of Rudi Kurniawan, the most famous wine criminal in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 10-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e56ebc3b8b3d4f7ea85866f32a0495b31fd7b161","amp;dn":"The+Wine+Show+S01E11+HDTV.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e56ebc3b8b3d4f7ea85866f32a0495b31fd7b161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,110,188,59,139,61,79,126,168,88,102,243,42,4,149,179,31,215,177,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
