He tore up the score and for many years it was believed lost; however after his death, the orchestral parts were found in the Leningrad Conservatory and the score was reconstructed, leading to its second performance (and American premiere) on 19 March 1948 at an all-Rachmaninoff concert marking the fifth anniversary of the composer's death. The second and third were much more popular. Other orchestral works include The Rock, Capriccio on Gypsy Themes, The Isle of the Dead, and the Symphonic Dances.\n\nRachmaninoff wrote two major choral works: the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom and the All Night Vigil or Vespers. The Bells, a work for choir and orchestra, is based on the translated poetry of Edgar Allan Poe; its four-movement program signifies the circle of life: youth, marriage, maturity, and death. The Vespers and The Bells are widely considered to be some of his finest works.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachmaninoff\n\n_____\n\nENCODING: LAME 3.96.1, alt-preset-abr, 192 Kbps\n\n\nSergei Rachmaninov / The Three Symphonies (Disc 1) - Leonard Slatkin &amp; St. Louis Symphony Orchestra\nYear: 1991\nTrack\tTitle\t\n1.\tSymphony No. 1 in D minor, Op.13: I.
