While science largely ignores this kind of psychic activity, many prominent scholars went on to explore the realms of ghosts and what might cause them to exist. Giving many accounts of various experiences of people, Phantom Encounters states in objective, journalistic-like manner, how ghosts may be messengers of the unconscious. Yet, without adhering to this belief, the book questions why some apparitions visit some, and not others. Why some ghosts are not pertinent to the percievers life, but to someone close by. Much food for thought, why also being entertaining as well as a great resource book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832aa7bf8113ab86baf2f618a07d4c32b6af6c93","amp;dn":"Phantom+encounters+%28Time-Life+Mysteries+of+the+Unknown%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832aa7bf8113ab86baf2f618a07d4c32b6af6c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,42,167,191,129,19,171,134,186,242,246,24,160,125,76,50,182,175,108,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
