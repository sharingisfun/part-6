In a pair of documentaries, Broomfield profiles the Wellington Rooms in Liverpool and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff.\r\nThe Wellington Rooms, built in 1815 by Edmund Aikin, was originally the social hub for the super-rich, slave traders, businessmen and the elite. The Prime Minister William Gladstone's family, themselves wealthy slave owners, invested heavily in this magnificent building with the most intricate detailing and proportions. A Wedgwood ceiling and sprung dance floor, with classical columns, create a building of love and light. \r\nDespite the depression in Liverpool's fortunes, it's a building that has brought enormous happiness to many different people over a couple of centuries. Countless people seem to have fallen in love and met their future partners in the assembly room. Now in a rundown state of faded glory, the question is - what to do with the Wellington Rooms?\r\nThe Coal Exchange in Cardiff, built in 1883 by Edward Seward, is a magnificent celebration of the industry of coal and its immense wealth. A glass-ceilinged exchange room with galleries on three floors and a unique lowered floor are a remarkable monument to this time. \r\nNow in serious neglect, the whole building, the size of a city block, faces demolition. It signifies the serious lack of resourcefulness on the part of Cardiff Council to celebrate and regenerate not only this building but the whole area. The once great Butetown Docks and the magnificent buildings surrounding the Coal Exchange have also been allowed to crumble and disintegrate. Rather than redevelop the docks in a way that they have been so wonderfully done in Liverpool, the docks in Cardiff have been filled in. Magnificent warehouses have been torn down, and the whole history of coal and the uniqueness of this area have been almost obliterated.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/Going-Going-Gone-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Going-Going-Gone-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Going-Going-Gone-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Going-Going-Gone-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Going-Going-Gone-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/Going-Going-Gone-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Going-Going-Gone-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Going-Going-Gone-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Going-Going-Gone-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Going-Going-Gone-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Going-Going-Gone-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Going-Going-Gone-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Going-Going-Gone-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/Going-Going-Gone-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/Going-Going-Gone-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Going-Going-Gone-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2602 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.13 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07chym0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf179d5796b528c793d554072c905aee0c008d7","amp;dn":"BBC+Going+Going+Gone+Nick+Broomfields+Disappearing+Britain+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf179d5796b528c793d554072c905aee0c008d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,241,121,213,121,107,82,140,121,61,85,64,114,201,5,174,224,192,8,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
