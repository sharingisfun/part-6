Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics.\n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.\n\n\nThe Autumn of the Patriarch\n\nThe Autumn of the Patriarch (original Spanish title: El otoÃƒÂ±o del patriarca) is a novel written by Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez in 1975.\n\nA &quot;poem on the solitude of power&quot; according to the author, the novel is a flowing tract on the life of an eternal dictator. The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypical Caribbean tyrant.\n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life autocrats, including Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of his Colombian homeland, Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain (the novel was written in Barcelona), and Venezuela's Juan Vicente GÃƒÂ³mez. The product is a universal story of the disastrous effects created by the concentration of power into a single man.\n\nThe book is written in long paragraphs with extended sentences. The general's thoughts are relayed to the reader through winding sentences which convey his desperation and loneliness alongside the atrocities and ruthless behavior that keep him in power.\n\nOne of the book's most striking aspects is its focus on the God-like status held by the protagonist and the unfathomable awe and respect with which his people regard him. Dictators and strongmen such as Franco, Somoza, and Trujillo managed to hold sway over the populations of their nations despite internal political division. GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez symbolizes this with the discovery of the dictator's corpse in the presidential palace.\n\n\nThe torrent contains The Autumn of the Patriarch in ePUB format.\n\nR.I.P.
