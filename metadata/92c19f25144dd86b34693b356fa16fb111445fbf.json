It was Bowie's first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Hunky Dory has been described by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having &quot;a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mÃƒÂ©lange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class.&quot;\nThe style of the album cover was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photo shoot.\nMusical biographer David Buckley said of Hunky Dory, &quot;Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career . The opening track, &quot;Changes&quot;, focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (&quot;Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through&quot;) and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (&quot;Look out, you rock 'n' rollers&quot;). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot;, &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; and the Velvet Underground inspired &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;.\nFollowing the hard rock of Bowie's previous album The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of Space Oddity, with light fare such as &quot;Kooks&quot; (dedicated to his young son, known to the world as Zowie Bowie but legally named Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones) and the cover &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot; sitting alongside heavier material like the occult-tinged &quot;Quicksand&quot; and the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot;. Between the two extremes was &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;, whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by Nietzsche, predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by &quot;the Homo Superior&quot;, and which has been cited as a direct precursor to &quot;Starman&quot; from Bowie's next album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\n\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Folk rock, glam rock, art rock\nQuality: FLAC (image+.cue)\nTracklist:\n\n01.
