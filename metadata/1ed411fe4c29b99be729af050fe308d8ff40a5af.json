The controls are damn near perfect, you can get used to them very quickly making the game a lot of fun.\n\nINFO:\n\nAs the first Formula One product for PSP, Formula One includes all of the official licensed tracks, cars and drivers of the FIA Formula One World Championship. F1 Grand Prix on PSP offers fast action game play with seven challenge modes. Try the Eliminator Championship Mode where a car is eliminated after each lap; tackle the Challenge Mode with contests including speed and racing line tests; or race the Mini Grand Prix for three quick laps for quick bursts of racing action. \n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nCore 2 duo 2.4GHz or higher.\n\nnVidia GeForce GT 620 / ATI Radeon HD 5 series or higher.\n\n3 Gig of ram or more.\n\nWindows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 32 or 64bit OS.\n\n\nPPSSPP is the easiest emulator to use; I have already pre-configured the best settings for this game, so start the emulator, load the ISO and off you go. \n\nI have also pre-configured the controls to suit the Xbox360 controller, but you can change all of the control settings if you like.\n\nIGN Rating:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/f1-grand-prix/psp-682956&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/f1-grand-prix/psp-682956&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMy Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eANkhAAfa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eANkhAAfa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nPlease seed for others\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed411fe4c29b99be729af050fe308d8ff40a5af","amp;dn":"F1+Grand+Prix+%28Emulated+for+PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed411fe4c29b99be729af050fe308d8ff40a5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,212,17,254,76,41,185,155,231,41,175,5,15,227,8,216,255,64,165,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
