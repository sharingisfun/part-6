There are times on this recording when one might understand why Davis and Rivers never meshed, and times when the partnership is quite wonderful. The almost-second great quintet heard on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miles in TokyoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an aberration, a rare gem, and worth investigating.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Miles in BerlinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (September 25, 1964) marks the first recorded date of Miles Davis's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second Great QuintetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Wayne Shorter on saxophone. It was only the band's third date together. In each song, the mental affection between the players is strikingly evident, realizing an internal, truly improvised aim to compose music from out of the air.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nCD 1: Miles in Tokyo (1964)\n\nCD 2: Miles in Berlin (1964)\n\n\n   2 CDs / 2005 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miles in TokyoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½:\n\n1.
