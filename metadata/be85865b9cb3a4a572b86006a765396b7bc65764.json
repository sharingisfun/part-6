Burr\n\nStimulus plans: good or bad? Free markets: How free are they? Jobs: Can we afford them? Occupy Wall Street . . . worldwide!\n\nEverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking about the economy, but how can we, the people, understand what Wall Street or Washington knowsÃ¢â‚¬â€or say they know? Read Economix.\n\nWith clear, witty writing and quirky, accessible art, this important and timely graphic novel transforms Ã¢â‚¬Å“the dismal scienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of economics into a fun, fact-filled story about human nature and our attempts to make the most of what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got . . . and sometimes what our neighbors have got. Economix explains it all, from the beginning of Western economic thought, to markets free and otherwise, to economic failures, successes, limitations, and future possibilities. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the essential, accessible guide to understanding the economy and economic practices. A must-read for every citizen and every voter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be85865b9cb3a4a572b86006a765396b7bc65764","amp;dn":"Economix%3A+How+and+Why+Our+Economy+Works+%28and+Doesn%27t+Work%29+%282012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be85865b9cb3a4a572b86006a765396b7bc65764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,133,134,91,156,179,164,165,114,184,96,6,167,101,57,107,123,198,87,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
