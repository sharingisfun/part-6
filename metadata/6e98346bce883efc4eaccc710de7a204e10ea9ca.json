This is as complete a discography as you are going to get without hunting down some obscure LP singles and ripping them, which I might well just do sometime, but for now this is complete enough, with every single album, as well as two exclusive single tracks from the &quot;From hell to obscurity&quot; cd.\n\nI don&amp;#039;t have the Rhino release of his first two albums, so I don&amp;#039;t have the bonus track &quot;The Drinking Song&quot;. While this song is, in a very similar version, on Album III, it is not the same, as I have heard a low quality mp3 of it. I ask, kindly, if anyone has this track to make it available.\n\nI might do bootlegs later, if enough people are interested.\n\nCheers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e98346bce883efc4eaccc710de7a204e10ea9ca","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e98346bce883efc4eaccc710de7a204e10ea9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,152,52,107,206,136,62,252,78,172,204,113,13,231,162,4,225,14,169,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
