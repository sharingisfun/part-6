He claims that he and the FBI have the same interests: bringing down dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will co-operate, but insists that he will speak only to Elizabeth Keen, a rookie FBI profiler. Keen questions Reddington's sudden interest in her, though he claims that Keen is very special. After the FBI brings down a terrorist he provided information on, Reddington reveals that the terrorist is only just the first of many. In the last two decades, he's made a list of criminals and terrorists he believes the FBI cannot find because they did not know they exist and that they matter the most. Reddington calls it &quot;The Blacklist&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6931a4b049f40065665f59f2fdf185226865557","amp;dn":"The.Blacklist.S01E04.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6931a4b049f40065665f59f2fdf185226865557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,147,26,75,4,159,64,6,86,101,245,159,47,223,24,82,38,134,85,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
