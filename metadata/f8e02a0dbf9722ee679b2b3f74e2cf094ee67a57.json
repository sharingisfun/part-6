Let author Patrick Royal show\nyou how to harness the MATLAB tools and gain a level of fluency with the\nlanguage. He shows how to work with the core syntax, which is\nsignificantly different than other programming languages; create scripts\nand functions; debug your program; and finally, work with plots,\nannotations, and images. The final chapter covers external\ntoolboxes.extensions and libraries that automate, complement, and enhance\nexisting MATLAB functionality.\n\nTopics include:\n* Installing MATLAB\n* Working with MATLAB variables\n* Working with matrix and scalar operations\n* Creating functions\n* Understanding performance considerations\n* Building basic plots\n* Creating responsive programs\n* Editing variables manually\n* Working with the Statistics Toolbox\n\nAuthor: Patrick Royal\nSubject: Developer, Desktop Apps, Programming Languages\nSoftware: MATLAB\nLevel: Intermediate\nDuration: 1h 30m\nReleased: Jun 12, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e02a0dbf9722ee679b2b3f74e2cf094ee67a57","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+Up+and+Running+with+MATLAB-ELOHiM+-+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e02a0dbf9722ee679b2b3f74e2cf094ee67a57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,224,42,13,191,151,34,238,103,155,43,63,116,226,207,9,78,230,122,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
