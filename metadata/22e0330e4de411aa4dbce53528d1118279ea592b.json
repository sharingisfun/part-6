If you love country music than I highly recommend this excellent CD, and even if you aren't into country music you still might like this CD, it's awesome!\n[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e0330e4de411aa4dbce53528d1118279ea592b","amp;dn":"Women+Of+Country+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1999+Various+Artists+Initimat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e0330e4de411aa4dbce53528d1118279ea592b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,224,51,14,77,228,17,170,77,188,229,53,40,209,17,130,121,234,89,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
