Rise up the ranks of the family business. Marry the rich girl of his parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dreams. Pretend that wealth and privilege was all heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever wanted. Then a girl named Della breezed into town, a beautifully imperfect stranger who captured his heart and opened his eyes to a new kind of future. Woods is ready and willing to sacrifice everything for her when the sudden death of his father leaves him with his mother to care for and a business to manage.\n\nDella is determined to be strong for Woods, even as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quietly falling to pieces. No matter how far from home sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s run, the ghosts of her past have never stopped haunting her. Struggling to hide her true feelings from Woods, Della fears she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be his rock without dragging him down into the darkness with her. But is she strong enough to let go of the last thing holding her together?\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91999380818c426d1af2cfc181f5e7cdd600ee5","amp;dn":"Simple+Perfection+-+Abbi+Glines.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91999380818c426d1af2cfc181f5e7cdd600ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,25,153,56,8,24,196,38,209,175,44,252,24,31,94,124,221,96,14,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
