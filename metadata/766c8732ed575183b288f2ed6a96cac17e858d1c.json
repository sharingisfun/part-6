A \npreliminary survey among 29 European countries showed considerable \nvariation in postgraduate training. Based on these findings, the ERS School \ndeveloped a range of consensus documents: a core syllabus describing the \ncompetencies required, a curriculum of recommendations indicating how \ncompetencies should be taught and learned, an accreditation methodology \nfor training centres, and a voluntary European examination to assess whether \nspecialists have acquired the knowledge-based component of competence. The \nHandbook, together with a vast array of educational material, such as lectures, \narticles published in Breatheand the European Respiratory Monograph, and other \nlectures and courses, all available on the ERS School website, together comprise \nan unrivalled educational resource for anyone preparing for the European \nExamination in Adult Respiratory Medicine.\nThe first edition of the ERS Handbook of Respiratory Medicinewas published \nin 2010 with the aim of providing state-of-the-art summaries in all areas of \nrespiratory medicine. This second edition of the Handbookhas been extensively \npeer review and revisited, and includes new sections on\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ cytology of the lung\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ HRCT of the chest\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ long-term ventilation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ opportunistic infections in the immunocompromised host\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the pharmacology of asthma and COPD\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ HRCT in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ pathology and molecular biology of lung cancer\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ palliative care \nThe Handbookis a comprehensive, easily accessible source of the essentials \nof respiratory medicine for senior medical staff requiring revalidation, and \nnursing and allied healthcare professionals at all levels who wish to keep \ntheir knowledge up to date. All readers can be assured that as they set sail to \nmanage patients across the spectrum of respiratory disorders, they are armed \nwith the best information, access to multiple-choice questions to check their \nknowledge, and a source guide for more in-depth study.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766c8732ed575183b288f2ed6a96cac17e858d1c","amp;dn":"ERS+Handbook+of+Respiratory+Medicine%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766c8732ed575183b288f2ed6a96cac17e858d1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,108,135,50,237,87,81,131,178,136,242,237,106,150,202,193,126,133,141,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
