Tested virtual machine using VMware Workstation 7.0.0-build 203739. Virtual machine is clean of personal information, any time a name or user was required &quot;User&quot; was used.\n\nArchive has been compressed with 7-Zip 9.10 using maximum LZMA2 compression.\n\nOriginal size: 11457 MB\nCompressed size: 8341 MB\nCompression ratio: 72%\n\n---- Prerequisites -----\n\nVMware Workstation 7 (Included)\nPremade OS X Virtual Machine (Included)\nVMware Tools for OS X (Included - darwin_snow.iso)\n64-bit Intel processor with Virtualization Technology\n\n----- Usage -----\n\n1. Install VMware Workstation if not already done so.\n2. Extract and then copy the &quot;Mac OS X 10.6.2&quot; directory to your Virtual Machines directory.\n3. Open the virtual machine in VMware and edit the processor, RAM and hard drive settings to your liking.\n4. Set darwin_snow.iso (under Misc) as CD-ROM media.\n5. Boot your virtual machine.\n\n---- Tips ----\n\nI recommend taking a snapshot of the virtual machine prior to making any major changes such as a system update.\n\nYou will always need to use the darwin_snow.iso to boot your VM but this is a small price to pay for having Snow  Leopard in a VM, using a vanilla install disk at that. Not having darwin_snow.iso mounted at boot will result in an Operating system not found error.\n\nIf you have any difficulties with this premade virtual machine, you can try setting up OS X yourself using the guide at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.online-tech-tips.com/mac-os-x/install-snow-leopard-on-pc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.online-tech-tips.com/mac-os-x/install-snow-leopard-on-pc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have successfully installed iLife 09 and Microsoft Office 2008 in this virtual machine however they are NOT included for the sake of keeping this torrent below 10 GB.\n\niLife 09: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4679908/iLife__09_Install_DVD.dmg\nMicrosoft Office 2008: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4011190/Microsoft_Office_2008_for_Mac_-_Standard_Edition___14_serials\n\nTo mount these in VMware, use dmg2img from http://vu1tur.eu.org/tools/.\n\n-- Duff\n\nCredit to &quot;P|astikman&quot; and &quot;Online Tech Tips&quot; for the original guide on setting up OS X in VMware.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf399e9b7fd3b1d13d47322cdfb84a3f95341d5","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+10.6.2+Virtual+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf399e9b7fd3b1d13d47322cdfb84a3f95341d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,243,153,233,183,253,59,29,19,212,115,34,205,251,132,163,249,83,65,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
