But how do you document a horrific tragedyâ€”a deadly school shooting by a classmate?\r\nStruggling to comprehend this cataclysmic eventâ€”and propelled by a sense of responsibility to the town, their parents, and their schoolâ€”these four â€œluckyâ€ survivors vow to honor the memories of those lost, and also, the memories forgotten in the shadow of violence. But the shooting is only the first inexplicable trauma to rock their small suburban St. Louis town. A series of mysterious house fires have hit the families of the victims one by one, pushing the grieving town to the edge.\r\nNick, the son of the lead detective investigating the events, plunges into the case on his own, scouring the Internet to uncover what could cause a fire with no evident starting point. As their friend pulls farther away, Matt and Christina battle to save damaged relationships, while Zola fights to keep herself together.\r\nA story of grief, community, and family, of the search for understanding and normalcy in the wake of devastating loss, Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down explores profound questions about resiliency, memory, and recovery that brilliantly illuminate the deepest recesses of the human heart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea5fd47958ca3a67ab4fc2b8da47246a7f939a5","amp;dn":"Our+Hearts+Will+Burn+Us+Down+-+Anne+Valente+%5BEN+EPUB+AZW3%5D+%5Beboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea5fd47958ca3a67ab4fc2b8da47246a7f939a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,165,253,71,149,140,163,166,122,180,252,43,141,164,114,70,167,249,57,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
