The record reached number 36 on the Billboard album chart. A re-recorded version of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; was the album's lead single and reached number 78 on the Billboard singles chart that year. Despite the acclaim awarded the album, by the end of 1983 Murmur had only sold about 200,000 copies, which I.R.S.'s Jay Boberg felt was below expectations. Murmur was eventually certified gold (500,000 units shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991.\n\nThe album drew substantial critical acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Steve Pond felt the album fulfilled the promise the band showed on Chronic Town. He wrote, &quot;Murmur is the record on which [R.E.M.] trade that potential for results: an intelligent, enigmatic, deeply involving album, it reveals a depth and cohesiveness to R.E.M. that the EP could only suggest.&quot; He concluded, &quot;R.E.M. is clearly the important Athens band.&quot; It was Rolling Stone's Best Album of 1983, beating Michael Jackson's Thriller, The Police's Synchronicity and U2's War.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e94d53185b8c49b233802ded27f63148f611f12","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Murmur+%28I.R.S.+Years+Vintage%29+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e94d53185b8c49b233802ded27f63148f611f12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,148,213,49,133,184,196,155,35,56,2,222,210,127,99,20,143,97,31,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
