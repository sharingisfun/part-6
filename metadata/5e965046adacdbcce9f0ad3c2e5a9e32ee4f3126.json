So yeah, here's their discography, all in 320kbps mp3s neatly tagged with all album covers  . Oh, and the Dysgenics video is there. The rips aren't really mine, I got this off some torrent ages ago but its nowhere to be found now.\n\nAnyways, go attend QV concerts, they're awesome. And remember to buy their music. Supporting artists is key to keeping the underground alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e965046adacdbcce9f0ad3c2e5a9e32ee4f3126","amp;dn":"Quo+Vadis+Discography+%28Technical+Melodic+Death+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e965046adacdbcce9f0ad3c2e5a9e32ee4f3126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,150,80,70,173,172,219,204,233,240,173,60,46,90,158,50,238,79,49,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
