His work is frequently associated with postmodernism and post-structuralism.\n\n\nSimulacra and Simulation\n\nJean Baudrillard\nTranslated by Sheila Glaser\n\nPublished:February 15, 1995\n\nPublisher:University of Michigan Press\n\n\nThe first full-length translation in English of an essential work of postmodernist thought\n\nAbout the Book\n\nThe first full-length translation in English of an essential work of postmodernism.\n\nThe publication of Simulacra et Simulation in 1981 marked Jean BaudrillardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first important step toward theorizing the postmodern. Moving away from the Marxist/Freudian approaches that had concerned him earlier, Baudrillard developed in this book a theory of contemporary culture that relies on displacing economic notions of cultural production with notions of cultural expenditure.\n\nBaudrillard uses the concepts of the simulacraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the copy without an originalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and simulation. These terms are crucial to an understanding of the postmodern, to the extent that they address the concept of mass reproduction and reproduceability that characterizes our electronic media culture.\n\nBaudrillardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book represents a unique and original effort to rethink cultural theory from the perspective of a new concept of cultural materialism, one that radically redefines postmodern formulations of the body.\n\nSheila Glaser is an editor at Artforum magazine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a642d9c8599df632d29fd61a381c5c31a5ac2e","amp;dn":"Simulacra+And+Simulation+-+Jean+Baudrillard+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a642d9c8599df632d29fd61a381c5c31a5ac2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,166,66,217,200,89,157,246,50,210,159,214,26,56,28,92,49,165,172,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
