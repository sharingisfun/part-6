The thirty-five chapters describe the life of a Roman family in the 2nd century A.D., and culminate in readings from classical poets and Donatus Ars Grammatica, the standard Latin school text for a millennium. Each chapter is divided into two or three lectiones (lessons) of a couple pages each followed by a grammar section, Grammatica Latina, and three exercises or Pensa. Hans ÃƒËœrbergs impeccable Latinity, humorous stories, and the Peer Lauritzen illustrations make this work a classic. The book includes a table of inflections, a Roman calendar, and a word index, Index vocabulorum.\n\nIn Part II, Roma Aeterna, the subject is Roman history. Roma Aeterna includes a wide range of classical Latin literature. The main subject of the twenty-one long chapters is Roman history as told by Roman authors themselves. A description of the monuments of Rome, is followed by a prose version of Vergil s Aeneid I-IV, with extracts from the original, and Livy s Book I, supplemented by extracts from Ovid. At first, Livy s prose is gently adapted, but most of the book integrates unadapted texts by Livy, Aulus Gellius, Nepos, Sallust, Cicero and Horace with linguistic and historical information in a seamless narrative. The Indices is a supplement which contains lists of the Roman consuls and their triumphs (Fasti consulares and triumphales), as well as name and word Indices covering the whole course.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:291584f52a06bc543f12dec42a60ae246c16998c","amp;dn":"Lingua+Latina+per+se+Illustrata+I%2C+II+and+supplements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"291584f52a06bc543f12dec42a60ae246c16998c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,21,132,245,42,6,188,84,63,18,222,196,42,96,174,36,108,22,153,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
