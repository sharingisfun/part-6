The ska-pop sound of their first album, No Doubt, failed to make waves due to the popularity of the grunge movement at the time. The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom helped to launch the ska revival of the 1990s, and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, the third single from the album, set a record when it spent sixteen weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart, later broken by the Goo Goo Dolls' &quot;Iris&quot;.\n\nThe group released its next album, Return of Saturn, four years later, but despite positive reviews, the album was considered a commercial failure. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with Rock Steady, which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;.\n\nNo Doubt released the compilation The Singles 1992ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2003 and box set Boom Box in 2003, both of which contained a cover version of the Talk Talk synthpop song &quot;It's My Life&quot;. Frontwoman Gwen Stefani launched her solo career the next year with several collaborations, including bandmate Tony Kanal and Neptune Pharrell, while guitarist Tom Dumont began his side project, Invincible Overlord. During its career, the band has won two Grammy Awards and sold 27 million records worldwide to date.[1] \n\n\n\n\n\nTragic kingdom \n\n\n\nTragic Kingdom is the third studio album by American third wave ska band No Doubt, released on October 10, 1995 on Trauma Records, a division of Interscope Records. The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and was recorded in eleven different studios across California between March 1993 and October 1995. The album takes its name from the nickname Tom Dumont's teacher had for Disneyland in California ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a pun on the nickname &quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot;.\n\nFollowing the release of the band's debut album, No Doubt, released in 1992, Interscope Records paired the band with producer Matthew Wilder and rejected much of the band's material, refusing to let them record a second album under Interscope. This alienated songwriter Eric Stefani, who withdrew from and eventually left the band in 1994. Frustrated by their lack of progress with Interscope, No Doubt recorded and released their second album, The Beacon Street Collection (1995), independently. It sold 100,000 copies and ensured that Interscope would finance another album. During one of the recording sessions for Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt met Paul Palmer, owner of Trauma Records, who persuaded Interscope to sign No Doubt to him and released the album under his own label.\n\nUpon its release, Tragic Kingdom received mixed reviews from music critics. It sold over sixteen million copies worldwide and was certified diamond by the RIAA in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple-platinum in Australia. At the 39th Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. The album's sales helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them attract mainstream attention. Tragic Kingdom spawned seven singles from 1995 to 1998, including &quot;Just a Girl&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1. &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;  \n2. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot;  \n3. &quot;Just a Girl&quot;  \n4. &quot;Happy Now?&quot;  \n5. &quot;Different People&quot;  \n6. &quot;Hey You&quot;  \n7. &quot;The Climb&quot;  \n8. &quot;Sixteen&quot;  \n9. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;  \n10. &quot;Don't Speak&quot;  \n11. &quot;You Can Do It&quot;  \n12. &quot;World Go 'Round&quot;  \n13. &quot;End It on This&quot;  \n14. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;  \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fede8dee41ceeb74393586cb69da43f752e3d83","amp;dn":"No+Doubt+-+Tragic+Kingdom+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fede8dee41ceeb74393586cb69da43f752e3d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,237,232,222,228,28,238,183,67,147,88,108,182,157,164,63,117,46,61,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
