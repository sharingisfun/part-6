Rhine Gold 6:18\n\nThere's a chilly rigour to the orchestral compositions of Jannis Noya Makrigiannis, the singer/writer behind Copenhagen's Choir of Young Believers. But then, this is an unusual &quot;choir&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one that projects a feeling of isolation rather than uplifting togetherness. Makrigiannis is already a star at home, the recipient of a Danish Grammy, which says something about that country's appetite for music that would remain under the radar in the UK. This second album continues in the same vein as the 2009 debut: fragile, precisely enunciated vocals pick their way through frosty terrain created by synth, guitar and strings, for a result that gets discomfitingly under the skin. Makrigiannis occasionally gives in to the urge to go uptempo, and evokes Depeche Mode at their youthful perkiest when he does, as on the perversely ebullient Paint New Horrors. What makes Rhine Gold compelling, though, is the echo-chamber chill of The Third Time, the synth-haze that clouds the title track and the way his frozen heart cracks open as he croons: &quot;Oh, how I long for something different&quot; on The Wind is Blowing Needles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550269a98f50b7fe986a6af6c07b112c94984ca9","amp;dn":"Choir+Of+Young+Believers+-+Rhine+Gold+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550269a98f50b7fe986a6af6c07b112c94984ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,2,105,169,143,80,183,254,152,106,106,246,192,123,17,44,148,152,76,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
