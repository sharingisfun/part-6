Unlike other books it does not get bogged down in the complexities of the law, but tries to focus, in a very straightforward manner, on the core legal concepts most essential for business managers to know. Rather than conveying the material in the dry, serious manner of many other legal environment books, the text uses a reader-friendly style and frequent points of humor and levity to make it much easier for the key ideas to come across.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:857bbcb25068abba006eae10e79a9d2151ff4639","amp;dn":"The+Legal+Environment+of+Business%2C+11th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"857bbcb25068abba006eae10e79a9d2151ff4639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,123,188,178,80,104,171,186,0,110,174,16,231,154,157,33,81,255,70,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
