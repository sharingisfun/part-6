It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions. It is a fighter with both air superiority and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S.F-15E.\n\nThe Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella. KnAAPO manufactures the Su-30MKK and the Su-30MK2, The Chinese chose an older but lighter radar so the canards could be omitted in return for increased payload.\n\nIrkut offered the multirole Su-30MK/MKI for India Air Force, Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as canards, thrust-vectoring, and a long-range phase-array radar. The Russian Air force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\nThe Su-30 Flanker C from Bear Studios is an accurate and in-depth simulation product for Microsoft Flight Simulator FSX (ESP/Prepar 3D) and FS2004.
