The book covers unit, system, and non functional tests and includes examples on how to estimate the number of bugs expected to be found, the time required for testing, and the date when a release is ready. It weighs the cost of finding bugs against the risks of missing release dates or letting bugs appear in the final released product.\n\nIt is imperative to determine if bugs do exist and then be able to metric how quickly they can be identified, the cost they incur, and how many remain in the product when it is released. With this book, test managers can effectively and accurately establish these parameters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb522ed125045fef9f023dad57ad5f70c59090b0","amp;dn":"Manage+Software+Testing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb522ed125045fef9f023dad57ad5f70c59090b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,82,46,209,37,4,95,239,159,2,61,173,87,173,95,112,197,144,144,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
