Walk through walls. Shape-shift. Breathe underwater. Conjure loved onesÃ¢â‚¬â€or total strangersÃ¢â‚¬â€out of thin air. Imagine experiencing your nighttime dreams with the same awareness you possess right nowÃ¢â‚¬â€fully functioning memory, imagination, and self-awareness. Imagine being able to use this power to be more creative, solve problems, and discover a deep sense of well-being.\n\nThis is lucid dreamingÃ¢â‚¬â€the ability to know you are dreaming while you are in a dream, and then consciously explore and change the elements of the dream. A Field Guide to Lucid Dreaming, with its evocative retro illustrations, shows exactly how to do it. Written by three avid, experienced lucid dreamers, this manual for the dream world takes the reader from step oneÃ¢â‚¬â€learning how to reconnect with his or her dreamsÃ¢â‚¬â€ through the myriad possibilities of what can happen once the dreamer is lucid and an accomplished oneironaut (a word that comes from the Greek oneira, meaning dreams, and nautis, meaning sailor).\n\nReaders will learn about the powerful REM sleep stageÃ¢â‚¬â€a window into lucid dreams. Improve dream recall by keeping a journal. The importance of reality checks, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FingerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€during the day, try to pass your finger through your palm; then, when you actually do it successfully, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dreaming. And once you become lucid, how to make the most of it. Every time you dream, you are washing up on the shores of your own inner landscape.
