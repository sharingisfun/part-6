Android, Windows, and iOS support are all required for a successful productÃ¢â‚¬â€but learning the different environments is difficult. This course is one of a matched set spanning the three platforms and will demonstrate their similarities and differences. Start with the product most familiar to you, then watch the parallel courses to understand how to bridge your knowledge.\n\nLike its companions, this course will take you through building a complete mobile app from scratch; but this installment uses the Android SDK and Java to get the job done. Author David Gassner shows you how to install the SDK and the Android Developer Toolkit, create a project, save data on a device, build and control screen layouts, and create action bars and icons that control navigation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3c2d57b21c8f3b669ee60544adf86b2eb1dd89","amp;dn":"Building.a.Note-Taking.App.for.Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3c2d57b21c8f3b669ee60544adf86b2eb1dd89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,60,45,87,178,28,143,59,102,158,230,5,68,173,248,107,46,177,221,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
