Itâ€™s their first release with new vocalist Kâ€™noup (formerly of Viza) and itâ€™s an explosive one. Starting out with grinding â€œTsunami,â€ the album is an exploration of the questions and problems pervading the world right now. Kâ€™noupâ€™s vocals are incredibly strong and passionate, perfectly balanced between melodic and in your face â€“ â€œGod Sellsâ€ isnâ€™t letting anyone off the hook. Musically, the band isnâ€™t afraid to experiment with sound, be it on the guitar or keyboard. The later features prominently on the third track, â€œStarlord.â€ The guitar riffs are very tremolo heavy, and call to mind Sinister of Avenged Sevenfold. In fact, BLACKMORE and â€œNEOâ€ call to mind Avenged Sevenfold at many turns; sharing the raw energy and excitement of the later bandâ€™s early releases. Check out my favorite tracks, â€œ3 Ballets,â€ â€œOut of Reachâ€ and the last, brilliant track â€œA Cold Night (Icarus Song).â€ \r\n\r\nThanks to Arlene Allen for this review \r\n\r\nALBUM: Neo\r\n    \r\nYEAR: 2016\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Alt.Metal, Hard Rock\r\n    \r\nDURATION:\t00:37:41\r\n    \r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n01 Tsunami\r\n02 God Sells\r\n03 72\r\n04 Starlord\r\n05 Roses are Dead\r\n06 3 Ballets\r\n07 Eye for an Eye\r\n08 Nosedive\r\n09 Out Of Reach\r\n10 A Cold Night (Icarus Song)\r\n\r\nMembers: Vox: K'noup Guitars: Shaunt Sulahian Guitars: Vahan Aslanyan Bass: Andy Terzyan Drums: Vinny Mezian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7b766a05824eaa072fd4ef9feee63eaa841518","amp;dn":"Blackmore+-+Neo+2016+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7b766a05824eaa072fd4ef9feee63eaa841518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,123,118,106,5,130,78,170,7,47,212,239,159,238,230,62,170,132,21,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
