These Oklahoma hitmakers are in their 14th year together as a band, but they're still mining teenage dramatics for buoyant, chant-along tunes. From confronting a cheating girlfriend at a party to sighing about feeling claustrophobic in a small hometown over gyrating New Wave synth, pinup singer Tyson Ritter is a hook wielding bard of frustrated young suburbanites. Thankfully, his band shows signs of cracking through its own arrested development, especially in the sinuous groove of &quot;Bleed Into Your Mind&quot; and the sweetly vulnerable orchestral ballad &quot;Affection.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
