When Twin Peaks took off, however, the album became more or less its unofficial soundtrack thanks to the instrumental adaptation of &quot;Falling&quot; that served as the theme song. Other cuts, like the haunting, moody &quot;Into the Night,&quot; and &quot;Rockin' Back Inside My Heart&quot; turned up on the show as well; but as a beautiful, mysterious stand-alone effort, Floating is still that best of surprises, a left-field hit that loses nothing thanks to its fame. The combination of Cruise's sweet, light tones, Lynch's surprisingly affecting lyrics, which play just enough with clichÃƒÂ©s so as not to seem willfully ironic, and Angelo Badalamenti's combination of retro styles and modern ambience, is a winner throughout. The feeling is one of a '50s jukebox suddenly plunged into a time warp, dressed with extra sparkle and with a just-sleepy-enough, narcotic feeling. At its most upfront, the music can get downright raunchy -- check out the big band/sax blasts on the strutting tearjerker &quot;Rockin' Back Inside My Heart,&quot; or the sudden orchestral blast three minutes into &quot;Into the Night.&quot; Cruise herself has a wonderfully slow, burning passion that surfaces as well, such as in her whispers on &quot;Floating.&quot; But mostly everything is just sedate enough, crystalline rockabilly guitar playing gentle riffs with a slow slinkiness, Cruise's multi-tracked backing vocals and more combining beautifully. &quot;Falling&quot; remains the most well-known number, and a winner it is, too; Badalamenti's synth orchestrations are so affecting that Moby ended up sampling them for &quot;Go,&quot; kickstarting his own career. But songs like the just-spooky-enough &quot;The World Spins,&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale,&quot; with a great performance all around, ensure Floating's success as a through-and-through listen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bebfbaac1b887044241bae39213622878b95daaa","amp;dn":"Julee+Cruise+-+Floating+into+the+Night+%5B1989%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bebfbaac1b887044241bae39213622878b95daaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,191,186,172,27,136,112,68,36,27,174,57,33,54,34,135,139,149,218,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
