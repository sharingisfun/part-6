This book is also ideal for a wide range of amateur and professional woodworkers.\n\nVolume 2 builds on the fundamental knowledge introduced in volume 1, by covering more advanced topics and procedures, including machine tools. Essential Ã¢â‚¬Ëœback-upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ topics are presented throughout the text to revise the key aspects covered in volume 1. The reader is shown how to apply this basic theory to actual carpentry and joinery practice in a highly illustrated, easily accessible text.\n\nThe third edition has been fully updated in line with changes to the Building Regulations and current legislation, the third edition also incorporates developments in current best practice, with a comprehensive match to the latest qualifications in Wood Occupations.\n\n\n\nBy Brian Porter, Chris Tooke\nPublished by Routledge in 2005\nPDF, 226 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48204aef6942e14f67fb0a8ffa4e8e414a674cd","amp;dn":"Carpentry+and+Joinery%2CVol+2%28PDF%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48204aef6942e14f67fb0a8ffa4e8e414a674cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,130,4,174,246,148,46,20,246,127,176,168,255,164,232,228,20,166,116,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
