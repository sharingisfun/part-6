Staying in flow becomes increasingly difficult however, when dealing with the complexities of modern software synthesizers.\n\nBy looking at the most important things a synthesizer should do and designing simple work flows around these tasks, FAW feels it has created a synthesizer that is both powerful and complete in its features, yet simple and easy for the musician, sound designer and performer to use, play and stay in flow with.\n\nVisually Design Sounds\n\nSimply move colour coded circles around the interface to start creating your own unique sounds. Preview the connections by just hovering the circle beneath a knob. Explore sound in an intuitive way.\n\nPowerful Audio Engine\n\nChoose from a large variety of effects and audio modules. Mix the classic synthesizer tones of analog modeled filters and oscillators with contemporary wavetables and digital bit crushers.\n\nStart Right Away\n\nTo get you started, Circle comes with many pre-made sounds, in a wide variety of styles and genres.\n\nCreative control\n\nAssign your midi controllers in a simple and fast way with visual midi learn.
