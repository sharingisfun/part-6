Three women and two men blend guitar-bass-drums with dueling violins and everyone contributes equally to the ritual. There are chamber music flourishes somewhere in there, as well as folky frames on which to hang the riffs, but Rebecca Vernon's plainsong vocals are as striking as the destruction they're buried in.Metal archives ...Last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“More Constant than the GodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the third album released by American doomsters SubRosa, and it is an incredibly unique and brilliant effort. They have truly found their own niche in the genre of sludge metal. As well as punishing your ears with heavy bluesy riffs, the five piece features two violinists who provide an excellent addition to the atmosphere, really giving the music an extra dimension. Not just used as a gimmick or an add on like some bands out there, the violins are utilised fantastically, taking the lead at points in the music, giving an extra layer to the thick atmosphere in others. Guitarist/vocalist Rebecca Vernon is fantastic on this release, delivering riff after riff of sludgy, crushing brilliance, brilliant leads, and her deep, emotional powerful voice ties the whole thing together, her vocals matching the sludgy heavy sections to perfection, while the softer side of the voice fits excellently with the lovely mellow interludes. The Usher kicks off proceedings with RebeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant voice, dueting with male vocals over the brilliant violins, before kicking off into the riff heaven that follows. Cosey Mo is the most straight forwardly bluesy track on the release, with itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ripping riffs, while still having the gorgeous violins of the other tracks. Closing track Ã¢â‚¬Å“No safe HarbourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contains piano, flute and harpsichord, creating another incredible track. As with the violins, neither is used as a gimmick, each fits in perfectly.\n\n1.
