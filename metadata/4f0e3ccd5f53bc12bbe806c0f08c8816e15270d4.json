Witness their turbulent journeys, brought to life through rarely seen combat footage and the stories of the dedicated pilots and teams who fly and maintain these ultimate air warriors.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  C-17 Globemaster III \r\nThe C-17 Globemaster III is the Air Force's favorite heavy hauler, a flying warehouse that has stood tall against the mightiest of enemies for decades. Strangely, some of its toughest battles were fought right in America, where critics in Congress nearly scrapped the big gray beast before it even left the ground. This is the story of how the C-17 flew through all opposition to prove it could pull its weight in any situation, as told by the men and women who flew the &quot;Moose&quot; into and out of danger in Eastern Europe, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n2)  CH-47 Chinook \r\nPower, Strength, and Precision the CH-47 Chinook is not the most glamorous aircraft in the military's inventory, but it's been the Army's go-to helicopter for lifting heavy cargo for decades. The Chinook has proven its worth in every notable conflict since Vietnam, but to live through changing war zones, the aging chopper has needed to learn new tricks. Explore how the Army's oldest heavy hauler evolved, from its birth after the Korean War to its triumphant performances in Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond.\r\n\r\n3)  Drones \r\nDrones: they watch, analyze, even kill without ever risking a pilot's life. These unmanned aerial vehicles can be flown from anywhere on the globe and can get into places never before dreamed. They are widely used by military and civilians alike and can be seen almost everywhere, but exactly where, when, and how did these flying robots come to be? Join us as we follow drones over war zones, wildfires, and into aviation history as we detail their meteoric rise from yesterday's obscure wonder to today's global obsession.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen0.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen1.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen2.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen3.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen8.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen9.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen10.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen11.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen12.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d5/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen13.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen14.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/Air-Warriors-Series-3-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3776 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 46 mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.26 GB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/air-warriors/1003487","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0e3ccd5f53bc12bbe806c0f08c8816e15270d4","amp;dn":"Air.Warriors.Series.3.3of3.Drones.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0e3ccd5f53bc12bbe806c0f08c8816e15270d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,14,60,205,95,83,188,18,187,232,6,192,240,140,136,22,225,82,112,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
