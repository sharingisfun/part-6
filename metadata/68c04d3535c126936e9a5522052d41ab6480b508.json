The story revolves around the Hadleys, a wealthy but thoroughly debauched family of Texas oil millionaires. Robert Stack is self-destructive alcoholic Kyle Hadley, while Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her equally vivid potrayal of Kyle&amp;#039;s nymphomaniac sister Marylee. Kyle manages to win beautiful, level-headed advertising executive Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) away from his best friend, virile Hadley Oil geologist Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), but Lucy soon comes to regret her decision to marry into the hell-on-earth Hadley family. When Lucy becomes pregnant, Kyle assumes that Mitch is the father, leading to a maelstrom of fever-pitch emotionalism and stark tragedy. Before he quite knows what is happening, Mitch is on trial for murder; the one person who can clear him is the craven Marylee, who demands Mitch&amp;#039;s sexual favors as the price for her\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049966/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049966/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-6220&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-6220&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nDouglas Sirk\n\n\n\tRock Hudson\t... \tMitch Wayne\n\n\tLauren Bacall\t... \tLucy Moore Hadley\n\n\tRobert Stack\t... \tKyle Hadley\n\tDorothy Malone\t... \tMarylee Hadley\n\tRobert Keith\t... \tJasper Hadley\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c04d3535c126936e9a5522052d41ab6480b508","amp;dn":"Written+on+the+Wind+1956-Rock+Hudson-Lauren+Bacall.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c04d3535c126936e9a5522052d41ab6480b508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,192,77,53,53,193,38,147,110,154,85,34,5,45,65,171,100,128,181,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
