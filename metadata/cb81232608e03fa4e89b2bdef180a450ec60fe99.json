So instead, she challenged herself to have a single cup of coffee with a different person every week for a year to see what lessons she could learn about life and careers.\n\nWhat started out as a strange, unconventional, and slightly awkward experiment soon transformed into a year filled with adventure, hardship, courage, and personal growth.\n\nWhether she's grabbing a grande coffee with a former Starbuck's Vice President, discussing recess politics with a first grader, or debating talent with the co-founder of Apple, Megan's enthusiasm and empathy coax the best advice from every walk of life.\n\nAs a whole, 52 Cups of Coffee chronicles one young woman's daring and heartfelt first foray into life after college. Separately, each cup delivers a daily dose of inspiration--a perfect pairing for a morning cup of joe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb81232608e03fa4e89b2bdef180a450ec60fe99","amp;dn":"52+Cups+of+Coffee+-+Megan+Gebhart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb81232608e03fa4e89b2bdef180a450ec60fe99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,129,35,38,8,224,63,164,232,155,43,222,241,128,164,80,236,96,254,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
