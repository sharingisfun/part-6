Lvovich (Wiley, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book presents a balance of theoretical considerations and practical problem solving of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This book incorporates the results of the last two decades of research on the theories and applications of impedance spectroscopy, including more detailed reviews of the impedance methods applications in industrial colloids, biomedical sensors and devices, and supercapacitive polymeric films. The book covers all of the topics needed to help readers quickly grasp how to apply their knowledge of impedance spectroscopy methods to their own research problems. It also helps the reader identify whether impedance spectroscopy may be an appropriate method for their particular research problem. This includes understanding how to correctly make impedance measurements, interpret the results, compare results with expected previously published results form similar chemical systems, and use correct mathematical formulas to verify the accuracy of the data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnique features of the book include theoretical considerations for dealing with modeling, equivalent circuits, and equations in the complex domain, review of impedance instrumentation, best measurement methods for particular systems and alerts to potential sources of errors, equations and circuit diagrams for the most widely used impedance models and applications, figures depicting impedance spectra of typical materials and devices, extensive references to the scientific literature for more information on particular topics and current research, and a review of related techniques and impedance spectroscopy modifications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031943958fde7f458c43ca0705913343f39edf39","amp;dn":"Impedance+Spectroscopy+-+Applications+to+Electrochemical+and+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031943958fde7f458c43ca0705913343f39edf39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,25,67,149,143,222,127,69,140,67,202,7,5,145,51,67,243,158,223,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
