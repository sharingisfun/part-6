In ten clearly written and succinct chapters, leading scholars from around the English-speaking world treat all aspects of the civilization of Archaic Greece, from social, political, and military history to early achievements in poetry, philosophy, and the visual arts. Archaic Greece was an age of experimentation and intellectual ferment that laid the foundations for much of Western thought and culture. Individual Greek city-states rose to great power and wealth, and after a long period of isolation, many cities sent out colonies that spread Hellenism to all corners of the Mediterranean world. This Companion offers a vivid and fully documented account of this critical stage in the history of the West","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7632156edfe82ca493a1c89f612b3b70bac3b872","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Archaic+Greece","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7632156edfe82ca493a1c89f612b3b70bac3b872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,50,21,110,223,232,44,164,147,161,200,159,97,43,59,112,186,195,184,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
