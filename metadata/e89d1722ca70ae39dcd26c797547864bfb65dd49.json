The album was released by ABC-Dunhill Records in August 1969 and was a strong success along with the film, peaking at #6 on the Billboard album chart in September of that year.The songs on the soundtrack album are sequenced in the same order as they appear in the film, with the following differences: &quot;The Weight,&quot; as originally recorded by The Band for their 1968 debut album Music From Big Pink, was used in the film but could not be licensed for the soundtrack. To deal with this, ABC-Dunhill commissioned Smith, who recorded for the label at the time, to record a cover version of the song for the soundtrack album. Two songs used in the film, Little Eva's &quot;Let's Turkey Trot&quot; and The Electric Flag's &quot;Flash, Bam, Pow,&quot; were omitted from the soundtrack album.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoundtrack\nOriginal Release Date:\t1969\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.The Pusher - Steppenwolf\n02.Born To Be Wild - Steppenwolf\n03.The Weight - Smith\n04.Wasn't Born To Follow - The Byrds\n05.If You Want To Be A Bird (Bird Song) - The Holy Modal Rounders\n06.Don't Bogart Me (Aka Don't Bogart That Joint) - Fraterity Of Man\n07.If 6 Was 9 - The Jimi Hendrix Experience\n08.Kyrie Eleison/Mardi Gras - The Electric Prunes\n09.It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) - Roger McGuinn\n10.Ballad Of Easy Rider - Roger McGuinn\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89d1722ca70ae39dcd26c797547864bfb65dd49","amp;dn":"VA+-+Easy+Rider+Soundtrack+%282000%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89d1722ca70ae39dcd26c797547864bfb65dd49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,157,23,34,202,112,174,57,220,210,108,121,117,71,134,75,251,101,221,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
