More than 50 years after their heyday, however, their origins, the level of their success, the forces that cut the group's future off in its prime, and the allure that keeps their music selling are all difficult to explain -- as, indeed, none of this was all that easy to explain at the time. How could a song as pleasant and tuneful as &quot;Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&quot; be subversive?\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-weavers-p2165/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-weavers-p2165/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nThis is an excellent double-disc compilation of this group's more directly folk-related work from the mid 50s to the mid 60s. Note, however, that these are not the original Weavers recordings of their hits.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-r97244&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-r97244&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000EBD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000EBD&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD Universe's page: \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
