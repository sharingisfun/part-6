It's there that he meets a beautiful posh sort called Cassandra, who learns his name from the tag Del stitched into his raincoat (for a giggle).\n\nDel and Trig ditch The Nags Head in favour of propping up a wine bar. The rest is comedy gold. Rodney and the boys head to a club, where Rodders amazes the others by dancing with Cassandra.\n\nPlay a video clip Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nOne of the most popular OFAH scenes and arguably one of the best gags in British comedy history!\n------------------------\n\nDanger UXD\n\nTransmitted: 15.1.1989\nDuration: 50 minutes\nViewing Figures: 16.1 million\n\nDel continues to pursue the Yuppy lifestyle, and insists that Rodney follows suit by wearingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a suit.

The ambulance whisks him away, with both the jewellery and twelve-and-a-half grand still on his person.\n\nDespite being dead, Rodney spots Arnie collapsing and being whisked away from another restaurant.\n\nThey've been had, but no-one pulls a fast one quicker than the Trotters and revenge is the only dish on the menu at Arnie's next meal.\n-----------------\n\nThe Unlucky Winner Is...\n\nTransmitted: 29.1.1989\nDuration: 50 minutes\nViewing Figures: 17 million\n\nDel has entered every competition on the market, trying to win as many freebies as possible.\n\nRodney has unknowingly been entered for an art competition, and won it.

It could be his new fast-paced Yuppy lifestyle, or it could the eviction notice demanding three months worth of unpaid rent up front.\n\nTITCO hasn't been successful and the pressure's on to raise the cash.\n\nThe solution presents itself in the shape of Uncle Albert's lady-friend Elsie Partridge, a medium who lives off payments for her amazing predictions.\n\nDel thinks it's a load of mumbo-jumbo, but sets up a seance room in The Nags Head. Albert, worried for Del's health tells Elsie to say his Mum has contacted her asking him to go the doctor.\n\nWhen Marlene falls pregnant, just as Elsie foresaw, Del takes heed and is prescribed with irritable bowl syndrome.

His only relief is that the diploma arrives in the post.\n\nDel comes to the rescue, promising to call in all his favours to raise the money Rodney needs.\n\nTrouble is, the Driscoll brothers are calling in their debts, and those who can't pay get bruised.\n\nManaging to buy precious time, Del cons Boycie into paying for some dodgy video recorders and can cover the Trotter's debts. Meanwhile, Uncle Albert has Del sussed, and asks him how much Rodney's diploma cost.\n\nNot all goes to plan in the end, and Del fulfils the duties as a battered and bruised Best Man. After some words of Trotter wisdom, Rodders and Cassie journey to Rimini for their honeymoon.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7fb7a54e2c398fe31d59f06236de69f328f768","amp;dn":"Only+Fools+And+Horses%5BComplete+Series+6-xvids-winker%40kidzcorner-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7fb7a54e2c398fe31d59f06236de69f328f768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,127,183,165,78,44,57,143,227,29,89,240,98,54,222,105,243,40,247,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
