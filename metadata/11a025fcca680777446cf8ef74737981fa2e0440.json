If you're looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf.\n\nRework shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business. Read it and you'll know why plans are actually harmful, why you don't need outside investors, and why you're better off ignoring the competition. The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a025fcca680777446cf8ef74737981fa2e0440","amp;dn":"Rework","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a025fcca680777446cf8ef74737981fa2e0440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,160,37,252,202,104,7,119,68,108,248,239,116,115,121,129,250,46,4,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
