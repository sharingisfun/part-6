It is often cited as one of the first disco records.[2] In 1972 David Mancuso found a copy in a Brooklyn West Indian record store and often played it at his Loft parties.[3] The response was so positive that the few copies of &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; in New York City were quickly bought up.[3] The song was subsequently played heavily by Frankie Crocker, who DJed at WBLS, then New York's most popular black radio station.[3] Since the original was now unfindable, at least 23 groups quickly released cover versions to capitalize on the demand for the record.[3] Atlantic eventually licensed the song from the French record label Fiesta.[3] Their release of it peaked at #35 on the Billboard chart in 1973; in 1999 Dave Marsh wrote that it was &quot;the only African record by an African&quot; to crack the top 40.[4] At one point there were nine different versions of the song in the Billboard chart.[5] It became &quot;a massive hit&quot; internationally as well.[5]\n\n&quot;Soul Makossa&quot; was originally recorded as a B-side for &quot;Mouvement Ewondo,&quot; a song about Cameroon's association football team.[5]\n\nIt is probably best remembered for the chanted vocal refrain &quot;Mama-ko, mama-sa, ma-ka-ma-ko-ssa&quot;, which was also used in Michael Jackson's 1982 &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; (albeit in a different key with a not-so-monophonic melody) during the song's final bridge. It is also sampled in the hip hop song &quot;Face Off&quot; by artist Jay-Z on his album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 as well as the single &quot;Don't Stop the Music&quot; by Rihanna. The song is also sampled on the intro to The Carnival, Wyclef Jean's first solo album. The phrase &quot;ma ma say ah, ma ma coo sah&quot; also appears in the fourth verse of the song &quot;Rhythm (Devoted to the Art of Moving Butts)&quot; by A Tribe Called Quest, and in &quot;Mama Say,&quot; the debut single by the Bloodhound Gang. &quot;Makossa&quot; means &quot;(I) dance&quot; in Duala, a Cameroonian language.[6]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1915ca58a3bf93a6a1c3d6d5328791e90d21c223","amp;dn":"Manu+Dibango+-+Soul+Makossa+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1915ca58a3bf93a6a1c3d6d5328791e90d21c223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,21,202,88,163,191,147,166,161,195,214,213,50,135,145,233,13,33,194,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
