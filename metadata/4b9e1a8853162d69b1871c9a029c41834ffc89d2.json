Long before movies like Minority Report and The Matrix, the worldâ€™s writers have been recording the future as it might existâ€”and as it turns out, they were right. This bizarre anthology collects the most stunning predictions and imagined inventions here for the first time. Visions of Tomorrow includes â€œThe Land Iron Cladsâ€ by H. G. Wells, who described a military tank in 1903â€”long before it was ever a possibility; â€œThe Yesterday Houseâ€ by Fritz Leiber, who writes about cloned humans; â€œReasonâ€ by Isaac Asimov, who predicted solar power could be harnessed by satellites; and many more.\r\n\r\nIn this stunning anthology of never-before-collected stories, our worldâ€™s greatest science fiction writers demonstrate that the truth can be just as strange as fiction.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS:\r\n\r\nScience Fiction as Prophecy by Robert Silverberg\r\nPreface by Thomas A.
