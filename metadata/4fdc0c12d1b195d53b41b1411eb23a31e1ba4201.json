M. Nouwen - Reaching Out: The Three Movements of the Spiritual Life (Image, 1975). 165 pages.\n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\ndescription:\n\nWith the clarity and depth characteristic of the classics, this spiritual bestseller lays out a perceptive and insightful plan for living a spiritual life and achieving the ultimate goal of that life -- union with God.\n\nNouwen views our spiritual &quot;ascent&quot; as evolving in three movements. The first, from loneliness to solitude, focuses on the spiritual life as it relates to the experience of our own selves. The second, from hostility to hospitality, deals with our spiritual life as a life for others. The final movement, from illusion to prayer, offers penetrating thoughts on the most mysterious relationship of all: our relationship to God. Throughout, Nouwen emphasizes that the more we understand (and not simply deny) our inner struggles, the more fully we will be able to embrace a prayerful and genuine life that is also open to others' needs.\n\nReaching Out is a rich book to be read, reread, pondered, and shared with others. &quot;It does not offers answers or solutions,&quot; Nouwen cautions, &quot;but is written in the conviction that the quest for an authentic Christian spirituality is worth the effort and the pain, since in the midst of this quest we can find signs offering hope, courage, and confidence.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fdc0c12d1b195d53b41b1411eb23a31e1ba4201","amp;dn":"Henri+Nouwen+-+Reaching+Out%3A+The+Spiritual+Life+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fdc0c12d1b195d53b41b1411eb23a31e1ba4201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,220,12,18,209,177,149,213,59,65,177,65,30,178,58,49,225,186,66,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
