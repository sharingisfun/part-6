On Komeda, his ACT solo album debut, pianist Leszek MoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼er pays his own beautifully crafted tribute to his fellow countryman.\n\nDespite his early death, Komeda's body of work is extensive and influentialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½showing that it was possible to take the ideas and themes of American jazz and create something that had its own uniquely Old World atmosphere. In the 21st century trumpeter Tomasz StaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ko is probably the best-known exponent of Komeda's work, while the New York based Komeda Project, led by expat Polish musicians Andrzej Winnicki and Krzysztof Medyna, flies the flag for Komeda in the New World.\nMoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼er is a classically-trained pianist, born in Gdansk, who discovered jazz as an 18 year-old and now moves comfortably between the classical concert stage and jazz performance, garnering numerous awards along the way. He's played with StaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ko and has recorded with bassist Lars Danielsson. His classical background strongly influences the sound of KomedaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially on the opening bars of &quot;Svantetic,&quot; where he introduces the tune with some sparklingly delicate upper register flourishes.\nMany of Komeda's best-known compositions were written for Roman Polanski movies such as Rosemary's Baby (1968) or Knife In The Water (1962), films whose air of suspense and fear was heightened by the tension and darkness in Komeda's music. While MoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼er's choice of compositions includes some of this music, he focuses firmly on the more lyrical and romantic side of Komeda's work. Still, &quot;Sleep Safe And Warm,&quot; the lullaby from Rosemary's Baby, still retains some of that darknessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½however beautiful the melody may beÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while&quot;Cherry&quot; finds MoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼er developing a funkier, more aggressive, groove, and &quot;Crazy Girl&quot; and &quot;Moja Ballada&quot; both have an edgier tone.\nKomeda's cover art is a piece by German artist Martin NoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l. Its soft pastel tones are perhaps a little more restrained than the usual ACT cover images, but its calm and gentle beauty perfectly reflects the restrained loveliness of MoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼er's playing and Komeda's writing. ACT's selection of solo piano albums has another excellent addition in Komeda.\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n   Svantetic \u0013 03:31\n   Sleep Safe and Warm \u0013 06:21\n   Ballad for Bernt \u0013 04:12\n   The Law and The Fist \u0013 10:52\n   Nighttime, Daytime Requiem \u0013 13:36\n   Cherry \u0013 03:52\n   Crazy Girl \u0013 05:48\n   Moja ballada \u0013 02:53","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1dcffb33a1ea7d1622afba36ac86a09882ca2a8","amp;dn":"Leszek+Mozdzer+-+Komeda+%282011%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1dcffb33a1ea7d1622afba36ac86a09882ca2a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,220,255,179,58,30,167,209,98,42,251,163,106,200,106,9,136,44,162,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
