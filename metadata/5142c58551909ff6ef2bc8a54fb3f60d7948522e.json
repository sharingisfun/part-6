Martin, Graham P. Shaw\nFormat: PDF\nHardcover: 584 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (June 8, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 9780470660232 \n\nMathematics for Physicists is a relatively short volume covering all the essential mathematics needed for a typical first degree in physics, from a starting point that is compatible with modern school mathematics syllabuses. Early chapters deliberately overlap with senior school mathematics, to a degree that will depend on the background of the individual reader, who may quickly skip over those topics with which he or she is already familiar. The rest of the book covers the mathematics that is usually compulsory for all students in their first two years of a typical university physics degree, plus a little more. There are worked examples throughout the text, and chapter-end problem sets.\n\nMathematics for Physicists features:\n\n- Interfaces with modern school mathematics syllabuses\n- All topics usually taught in the first two years of a physics degree\n- Worked examples throughout\n- Problems in every chapter, with answers to selected questions at the end of the book and full solutions on a website\n\nThis text will be an excellent resource for undergraduate students in physics and a quick reference guide for more advanced students, as well as being appropriate for students in other physical sciences, such as astronomy, chemistry and earth sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5142c58551909ff6ef2bc8a54fb3f60d7948522e","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+Physicists+%5B2015%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5142c58551909ff6ef2bc8a54fb3f60d7948522e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,66,197,133,81,144,159,246,239,43,200,165,79,179,246,13,121,72,82,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
