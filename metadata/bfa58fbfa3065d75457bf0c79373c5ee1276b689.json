The album was first released in 1975 with the first CD print in 1987. \n\nThis rip is from the 1990 CD printing and contains FLAC and MP3 versions.\n\n- Big Papi\n[quote]\nBy Thomas Lapins\n\nThis was a collection of hits put together not only by the author but by an artist. It's the total package and concept that matters here. Of course the post-mortem greatest hits are more slick and inclusive. Five of the eleven songs on &quot;Shaved Fish&quot; were never on an LP before this collection: &quot;Give Peace A Chance,&quot; &quot;Cold Turkey,&quot; &quot;Instant Karma,&quot; &quot;Power To The People&quot; and &quot;Happy Xmas&quot;. Back in 1975 that was reason enough to grab this collection Sure &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; is butchered (and should not have been). But the age did not know about re-mastered compact discs that allowed for seventy minutes of crystal clear digital sound. Don't look at &quot;Shaved Fish&quot; through digital eyes but rather through the vinyl cracks and hisses and scratches of art and the 70's. The album cover is full of Lennon's humor and intelligence. The title is brilliant. Maybe you had to be there to really appreciate what I'm saying, and I'm not saying the other greatest hits shouldn't be grabbed and enjoyed. Enjoy them all. But this LP/CD is Lennon at his artful, political, humorous best. Don't compare 1975 to 2000. John and Yoko were a &quot;happening&quot; as was all their music and art and daily events. This collection rates with Lennon's &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot; recordings.
