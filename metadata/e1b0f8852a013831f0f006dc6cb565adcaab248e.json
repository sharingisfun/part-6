He died of a drug overdose in 1976.\n\nAfter performing in a variety of bands since the late '60s, Bolin finally released his first solo album in 1975. Teaser is an impressive display of the guitarist's prowess and range, and is a natural progression from the previous Bolin-dominated James Gang albums Bang and Miami and his work with drummer Billy Cobham. The album features heavy doses of jazz-rock fusion (furthered by guests Jan Hammer, Dave Sanborn, and Michael Walden) in the instrumentals &quot;Homeward Strut&quot; and &quot;Marching Powder,&quot; and straight-ahead rock in tracks like &quot;The Grind.&quot; Bolin was always equally adept at subtleties, and the ballad &quot;Dreamer&quot; and the exotic &quot;Savannah Woman&quot; (with percussion from Phil Collins) represent this stylistic range here. Overshadowed historically by his guitar dynamics, Bolin's understated yet strong vocals are another selling point. Teaser is a stronger album than its one successor, the uneven Private Eyes, and survives as Bolin's signature work.\n\nTHE BAND:\nTommy Bolin: guitar, vocals (all)  Stanley Sheldon: bass (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)\nPaul Stallworth: bass (4, 8, 9) Dave Foster: piano/synth (1, 2, 3)\nJan Hammer: synth (6, 7), drums (6) Ron Fransen: piano (9)\nDave Sanborn: sax (6, 7) Jeff Porcaro: drums (1, 2, 3, 5)\nPrairie Prince: drums (4, 8 ) Michael Walden: drums (7)\nBobbie Berge: drums (9)Phil Collins: percussion (4)\nSammy Figueroa: percussion (6, 7) Rafael Cruz: percussion (6, 7)\nDave Brown: background vocals (1) Lee Kiefer: background vocals (1)\n\n\n\n1.The Grind,  \n2.Homeward Strut\n3.Dreamer\n4.Savannah Woman\n5.Teaser  \n6.People, People\n7.Marching Powder\n8.Wild Dogs  \n9.Lotus\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b0f8852a013831f0f006dc6cb565adcaab248e","amp;dn":"Tommy+Bolin++Teaser%28blues+rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b0f8852a013831f0f006dc6cb565adcaab248e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,176,248,133,42,1,56,49,240,240,6,220,108,181,101,173,202,171,36,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
