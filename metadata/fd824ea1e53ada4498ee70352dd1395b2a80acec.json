Her journey starts in Lima where she meets the Brits locked up in Peru's jails for smuggling cocaine to Europe. Travelling into the countryside she then discovers how alarmingly easy it is for cocaine to be grown and produced here. Stacey joins government forces as they launch a major crackdown in an attempt to destroy this multi-million dollar industry - but will the fightback be enough? Finally she travels deep into the rainforest where farmers are growing a new super strain of coca plant. Able to grow in damp jungle conditions it threatens to open up millions of new acres to coca production and flood the world with even greater quantities of cocaine.\n\n2)  Thailands Drug Craze \nStacey investigates the growing drug craze sweeping through Thailand. Yaba, a dangerous mix of methamphetamine and caffeine, has gripped the nation and unleashed a wave of violence among its users. She uncovers the human cost, visiting a ward full of 'zombie' addicts, many of whom face the risk of long term psychosis, and meets users who have started taking the drug as young as 12. Stacey joins the Thai authorities as they try to fight back, joining patrols near the Burmese border and drug raids on Bangkok bars. In Bangkok she discovers that dealers are starting to target western tourists and asks if this dangerous new drug could soon claim its first victims amongst British tourists.\n\n3)  Europes Dirty Drugs Secret \nStacey travels to Ukraine to investigate the struggle to keep drugs out of the UK and reveals that drug cartels from South America have been using it as a transit hub to smuggle cocaine into Western Europe. In Odessa, officials show her the tricks traffickers use to hide drugs within cargoes and she learns that customs officials are notoriously open to bribes. Stacey discovers that local drug users are resorting to horrific homemade substitutes including 'crocodile', so called because it rots the flesh of users and turns it scaly. Stacey meets young addicts as they make a batch from bleach, petrol and tablets. Learning they have only months to live, Stacey is also shocked to hear that police have recently found 'crocodile' in the UK.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;92dafbf5fad2dea6bca2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1510 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 57mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 664 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Dooley&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Dooley&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd824ea1e53ada4498ee70352dd1395b2a80acec","amp;dn":"BBC+Stacey+Dooley+Investigates+3of3+Europes+Dirty+Drugs+Secret+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd824ea1e53ada4498ee70352dd1395b2a80acec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,130,78,161,229,58,218,68,152,238,112,53,45,209,57,91,42,128,172,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
