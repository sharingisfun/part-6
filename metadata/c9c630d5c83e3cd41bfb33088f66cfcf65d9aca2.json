What's most fascinating about Eureka is that its big, bright pop is actually the perfect showcase for O'Rourke's mastery of sound -- highlights like the epic opener &quot;Women of the World&quot; and a joyously schmaltzy cover of the Bacharach/David chestnut &quot;Something Big&quot; are crafted with remarkable care and depth, the former in particular building and blooming in truly majestic fashion. On a conceptual level, of course, it's easy to view Eureka as another in a long line of deconstructionist experiments, a reading more overtly avant songs like &quot;Movie on the Way Down&quot; and &quot;Through the Night Softly&quot; certainly bears out; on a deeper level, however, it's a true labor of love, and its sheer exuberance and creativity go further in re-shaping the pop aesthetic than any pure intellectual exercise ever could.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c630d5c83e3cd41bfb33088f66cfcf65d9aca2","amp;dn":"Jim+O%5C%27Rourke+-+Eureka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c630d5c83e3cd41bfb33088f66cfcf65d9aca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,198,48,213,200,62,60,212,27,251,51,8,143,102,207,207,101,217,172,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
