He was a member of the Oulipo group.\n\nMany of his novels and essays abound with experimental word play, lists and attempts at classification, and they are usually tinged with melancholy.\n\nPerec's first novel, Les Choses (Things: A Story of the Sixties) was awarded the Prix Renaudot in 1965.\n\nHis most famous novel, La Vie mode d'emploi (Life A User's Manual), was published in 1978. Its title page describes it as &quot;novels&quot;, in the plural, the reasons for which become apparent on reading. La Vie mode d'emploi is an immensely complex and rich work; a tapestry of interwoven stories and ideas as well as literary and historical allusions, based on the lives of the inhabitants of a fictitious Parisian apartment block. It was written according to a complex plan of writing constraints, and is primarily constructed from several elements, each adding a layer of complexity. The 99 chapters of his 600-page novel, move like a knight's tour of a chessboard around the room plan of the building, describing the rooms and stairwell and telling the stories of the inhabitants. At the end, it is revealed that the whole book actually takes place in a single moment, with a final twist that is an example of &quot;cosmic irony&quot;. It was translated into English by David Bellos in 1987. Some critics have cited the work as an example of postmodern fiction.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5969b7bb08926119bb9845bad7898d7443f1de","amp;dn":"Georges+Perec+-+4+books+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5969b7bb08926119bb9845bad7898d7443f1de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,89,105,183,187,8,146,97,25,187,152,69,186,215,137,141,116,67,241,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
