The First World War redrew national boundaries, eliminated monarchies, and left millions of soldiers and civilians dead, and its impact has continued to shape the Western political and social landscape since. \n\nIn this sweeping narrative, best-selling historian Martin Gilbert provides a view of the conflict that's both global and personal, drawing on eyewitness accounts, contemporary reporting, and first-hand documentation. It offers an immediate, compelling voice to familiar historical events, bringing new facets of the conflict to life and personalizing the tale with gripping survivor testimonies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d5d9a980b67c473a558ba2e4f5abd2a2b75b64e","amp;dn":"The+First+World+War%3A+A+Complete+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d5d9a980b67c473a558ba2e4f5abd2a2b75b64e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,93,154,152,11,103,196,115,165,88,186,46,79,90,189,42,43,117,182,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
