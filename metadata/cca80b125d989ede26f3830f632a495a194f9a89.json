Oliveira skips the usual bio-pic formula in favor of an extremely slow exploration of Vieira's soul. Each set-up is like a painting and the camera never moves an inch away from them. Vieira's passion and beliefs bring certain scenes to life, while other scenes quietly explore the man's essence. Word and Utopia can be rough going, but it's well worth it.\n\n\nportuguese audio, english, spanish, french, italian and portuguese subs\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca80b125d989ede26f3830f632a495a194f9a89","amp;dn":"Manoel+de+Oliveira+-+Palavra+e+utopia+AKA+Word+and+Utopia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca80b125d989ede26f3830f632a495a194f9a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,168,11,18,93,152,158,222,38,243,131,15,99,42,73,90,25,79,154,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
