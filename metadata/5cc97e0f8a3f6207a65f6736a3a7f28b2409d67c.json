However the topic of how iron age people (especially the Celts) used artwork is no revelation to those of us who have kept current in modern Celt studies. That art objects for the Celts had multiple uses and lived multiple lives (the main thesis to this text) is nothing particularly new. Some of us are in touch with archeologists of active Celtic sites and when archeologists discover almost all of the bronze votive horses found have one broken leg and it is broken in a similar way you get the idea that this was a manipulation done with a purpose.\nMany people who study the ancient Celts may find much in this book redundant. All the same a good book.
