Victoria Jossel and Romy Lewis, the creators of the company, spent weeks testing cupcake recipes and experimenting with piping bags and sugar sprinkles to create the most beautiful and delicious cupcakes. At the end of 2006, LOLA's was born and their bakers have been baking and decorating fresh batches of simple, sophisticated, handcrafted cupcakes every day since then. Now you too can make cupcakes with LOLA with this irresistible cookbook. There are more than 60 mouth-watering recipes for everything from the LOLA signature flavours (including Vanilla, Peanut Butter, Red Velvet, Lemon and Rocky Road) to deliciously original ideas like Chocolate Sundae, Toffee Apple, Salted Caramel, Cappuccino Wafer, Mint Hot Chocolate and Mango Berry Swirl.\n\nRomy Lewis and Victoria Jossel grew up in the same area of London when their families moved from South Africa in the early '90s. LOLA's was set up in 2006 by Victoria (a former derivatives trader at Goldman Sachs) and Romy (a journalist), both in their twenties. Their online store is the busiest part of their business, and they have a flagship store in Mayfair and concessions in Selfridges, Topshop and Harrods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01406f9d37302fb82aa53809c722ce27e7cafb2e","amp;dn":"Making+Cupcakes+with+LOLA+%28Cookbook%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01406f9d37302fb82aa53809c722ce27e7cafb2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,64,111,157,55,48,47,184,42,165,56,9,199,34,206,39,231,202,251,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
