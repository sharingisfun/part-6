The Rolling Stones From The Vault: The Marquee Club Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live in 1971 will be released via Eagle Rock on 22 June 2015.\n\n This remarkable performance was filmed for US television in 1971, shortly after The Rolling Stones had completed their 1971 Farewell Tour of the UK, and a month before the release of the album Sticky Fingers. The gig marked the first time tracks Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrown SugarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDead FlowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the rarely performed Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Got The BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ were showcased live; four tracks taken from the Sticky Fingers album. The line-up at this time was Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman.\n\n The show was an intimate, rare club appearance and very little footage has been released, until now. Part of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“From The VaultÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series of live concerts from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archive, The Rolling Stones From The Vault: The Marquee Club Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live In 1971 is a must own DVD for any Stones fan, featuring carefully restored footage and sound mixed to perfection by Bob Clearmountain.\n\n TRACKLISTING:\n Live With Me\n Dead Flowers\n I Got The Blues\n Let It Rock\n Midnight Rambler\n (I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get No) Satisfaction\n Bitch\n Brown Sugar\n BONUS TRACKS:\n I Got The Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alt.
