The Allied forces, led by American generals George S. Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower, are gaining control of Europe, leaving German leaders scrambling. Facing defeat, Adolf Hitler flees to a secret bunker with his new wife, Eva Braun, and his beloved dog, Blondi. It is there that all three would meet their end, thus ending the Third Reich and one of the darkest chapters of history. Hitler's Last Days is a gripping account of the death of one of the most reviled villains of the 20th century-a man whose regime of murder and terror haunts the world even today. Adapted from Bill O'Reilly's historical thriller, Killing Patton, and this book will have young readers-and grown-ups too-hooked on history.\n\nHitler's Last Days by Bill O'Reilly\nEnglish | 13 July 2015 | ISBN: 1627793968, 1627794557 | 320 Pages | EPUB/AZW3/PDF (conv) | 25.86 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d77425a16d6bd1701654629106ca773beec5b50","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Last+Days+by+Bill+O%27Reilly+%282015%29+-+%28epub%2Fpdf%2Fazw3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d77425a16d6bd1701654629106ca773beec5b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,119,66,90,22,214,189,23,1,101,70,41,16,108,167,115,190,236,91,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
