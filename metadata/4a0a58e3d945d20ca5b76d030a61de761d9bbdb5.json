Outro 4:07\n\n  M83's lush, expansive sound already made their albums feel twice as big as they were, so an actual double album from Anthony Gonzalez and company was inevitable. However, on Hurry Up, WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Dreaming, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use that extra space to top the widescreen nostalgia of Saturdays = Youth; instead, he fills it with songs that cover more sounds and moods than any of M83's previous work, resulting in a collection of impressionistic moments rather than a grand statement. The album begins with two songs that reaffirm Gonzalez's flair for the unapologetically epic music that makes him a rarity among artists in the 2010s, electronic or otherwise. He recruits Zola Jesus' Nika Roza Danilova for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Intro,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and her unusual mix of frostbitten edge and vulnerable warmth channels the huge emotions Gonzalez favors perfectly. Meanwhile, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight CityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s sleek neon tones show just how far heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s traveled from Saturdays = YouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ornate sound. However, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first disc goes even farther afield with the tender piano instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where the Boats GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Raconte-Moi Un Histoire,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where a child imagines a world where everyone turns into jungle frogs over bouncy synths and guitars, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soon, My Friend,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which ends the first half of the album with symphonic grandeur and Beach Boys harmonies. Hurry Up, WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Dreaming's second disc sounds more traditionally M83, from the triumphant-yet-heartbroken Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Tears are Becoming a SeaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the thrilling rush of Ã¢â‚¬Å“New MapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Steve McQueen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Despite the sprawl of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s size and sounds, Gonzalez holds everything together with wide-eyed enthusiasm. He handles most of the vocals here, singing with a yelp that evokes Howard Jones on Ã¢â‚¬Å“ReunionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“OK PalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- and while this album is as indebted to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s as Saturdays = Youth was, it somehow feels less steeped in nostalgia. Gonzalez displays his uncanny knack for making unfashionable sounds fresh again with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Claudia LewisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½' un-ironic slap bass and Ã¢â‚¬Å“SplendorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½'s childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choir; it takes guts to use these sounds and brains to use them well, and fortunately, he has both. Unlike Saturdays = Youth's wall-to-wall epics, Hurry Up, WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Dreaming offers ebb and flow, with interludes like the dreamy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Echoes of MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Klaus I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tipping the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s balance toward atmosphere instead of pop songs. More than any of M83's other albums, Hurry Up, WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Dreaming feels like a destination to explore; while it may not be quite as striking as Saturdays = Youth, it delivers a welcome mix of classic sounds and promising changes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a0a58e3d945d20ca5b76d030a61de761d9bbdb5","amp;dn":"M83+-+Hurry+Up%2C+We%27re+Dreaming+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a0a58e3d945d20ca5b76d030a61de761d9bbdb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,10,88,227,217,69,210,12,165,183,109,3,10,97,222,118,29,155,189,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
