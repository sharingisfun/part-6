The first 45 minutes or so sound good \r\nand strong, and Ten Years Gone is very pretty, but towards the middle \r\nsection, the individual performances, though good, don't quite gel \r\ninto a good ensemble performance. &quot;Well, it's nice to see you again&quot; \r\nsaid Plant to the audience at the beginning of the show, in fact they \r\nnot played in the United Kingdom for the last four years! The crowd \r\nroared. Achilles Last Stand is aggressive and In The Evening is \r\nintense, but Stairway To Heaven sounds timid and tired ... Robert's \r\nintroduction is so lackluster it is obvious he didn't want to play it. \r\nThe encores are energetic and good, and Whole Lotta Love features the \r\nnew arrangement first tried in Copenhagen in July. A short Heartbreaker \r\nfinishes the event. After the last note, Plant said: &quot;All you people \r\nthat have come so far. It's been kinda like a blind date. Thanks for \r\neleven years!&quot;\r\n\r\n(Contains the August 4th show.
