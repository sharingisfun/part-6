This course educates the developer from a master software engineering perspective with an eye toward frictionless development, best practices, and build and test automation.\n\nDescription\n\nSoftware engineer and Microsoft MVP Jeffrey Palermo guides developers through each part of the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework, and he demonstrates how to leverage each piece to its fullest with real-world code examples. Viewers will learn how to create well-structured MVC web applications from scratch, add libraries and dependencies to the web application without creating unnecessary coupling, and create dynamic web pages and screens that accept, validate, and process user input. Viewers will also learn how to expose complex data to the applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s users through screens, extend the MVC framework to create cross-cutting behavior with minimal code, and develop using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery to create MVC web applications that function equally well on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. While learning the framework, viewers will learn how to properly structure a software system that uses separation of concerns and layering so that applications can be maintainable for years to come.\n\nBased on the best-selling ASP.NET MVC 4 LiveLessons, this video training has been updated to use Visual Studio 2013 and the MVC 5 enhancements to security and authentication as well as integration enhancements such as WebAPI 2 and OData support. The result is that with MVC 5 and WebAPI 2, 80% of REST-style web services can now be done right alongside the rest of the web application without the complexity of WCF.\n\nAbout the Instructor\n\nJeffrey Palermo is a Managing Partner and CEO of Clear Measure, Inc., a software engineering firm in Austin, TX. At Clear Measure, Jeffrey manages the software engineering practice, which includes new system development, legacy system upgrades, performance/scalability improvements, and system rescues. Previously, Jeffrey has held executive positions at various firms including President, COO, CIO, CTO, Chief Architect, and VP of Engineering.\n\nJeffrey has been recognized by Microsoft as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Microsoft Most Valuable ProfessionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (MVP) each year since 2006. He has spoken and facilitated at industry conferences such as VSLive, DevTeach, the Microsoft MVP Summit, and Microsoft Tech Ed. He also speaks to user groups around the country as part of the INETA SpeakersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bureau. A graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, an Eagle Scout, and an Iraq war veteran, Jeffrey has published many magazine articles, and he has written three editions of his book, ASP.NET MVC in Action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1254ab6fb88a256c11b92d9c9c18eaad85238e","amp;dn":"LiveLessons+-+ASP.NET+MVC+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1254ab6fb88a256c11b92d9c9c18eaad85238e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,18,84,171,111,184,138,37,108,17,185,45,156,156,24,234,173,133,35,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
