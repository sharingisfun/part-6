In their prime, The O'Jays' recordings epitomized the Philly soul sound: smooth, rich harmonies backed by elaborate arrangements, lush strings, and a touch of contemporary funk. They worked extensively with the legendary production/songwriting team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, becoming the flagship artist of the duo's Philadelphia International label. The O'Jays were equally at home singing sweet love ballads or uptempo dance tunes, the latter of which were often mouthpieces for Gamble &amp; Huff's social concerns. Although The O'Jays couldn't sustain their widespread popularity in the post-disco age, they have continued to record steadily all the way up to the present day, modifying their production to keep up with the times. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.90% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\tZK 66114\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Love Train\n02.Back Stabbers\n03.992 Arguments\n04.Survival\n05.For The Love Of Money\n06.Put Your Hands Together\n07.Time To Get Down\n08.Sunshine\n09.Livin' For The Weekend\n10.I Love Music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159dece945a31ee7718ac8f022fa330f3304e767","amp;dn":"The+O%27Jays+-+Love+Train+Best+Of+The+O%27Jays+%281994%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159dece945a31ee7718ac8f022fa330f3304e767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,157,236,233,69,163,30,231,113,138,200,240,34,250,51,15,51,4,231,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
