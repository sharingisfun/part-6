The group's history began in Birmingham, England with Ray Thomas (harmonica, vocals) and Mike Pinder (keyboards, vocals), who had played together in El Riot &amp; the Rebels and the Krew Cats. They began recruiting members of some of the best rival groups working in Birmingham, including Denny Laine (vocals, guitar), Graeme Edge (drums), and Clint Warwick (bass, vocals). the Moody Blues, as they came to be known, made their debut in Birmingham in May of 1964, and quickly earned the notice and later the services of manager Tony Secunda. A major tour was quickly booked, and the band landed an engagement at the Marquee Club, which resulted in a contract with England's Decca Records less than six months after their formation. The group's first single, &quot;Steal Your Heart Away,&quot; released in September of 1964, didn't touch the British charts. But their second single, &quot;Go Now,&quot; released in November of 1964 -- a cover of a nearly identical American single by R&amp;B singer Bessie Banks, heavily featuring Laine's mournful lead vocal -- fulfilled every expectation and more, reaching number one in England and earning them a berth in some of the nation's top performing venues (including the New Musical Express Poll Winners Concert, appearing with some of the top acts of the period); its number ten chart placement in America also earned them a place as a support act for the Beatles on one tour, and the release of a follow-up LP (Magnificent Moodies in England, Go Now in America) on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor\nCatalogue:\t\t31451 6436 2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1     99.80% CDDA\n\n01.Fly Me High\n02.Love And Beauty\n03.Cities\n04.Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)\n05.Nights In White Satin\n06.Ride My See-Saw\n07.Legend Of A Mind\n08.House Of Four Doors\n09.Voices In The Sky\n10.The Best Way To Travel\n11.The Actor\n12.In The Beginning\n13.Lovely To See You\n14.Dear Diary\n15.Never Comes The Day\n16.Are You Sitting Comfortably\n17.The Dream\n18.Have You Heard, Part 1\n19.The Voyage\n20.Have You Heard, Part 2\n\n\nDisc 2     99.90% CDDA\n\n01.Higher And Higher\n(Of A Strange And Distant Time)\n03.Eyes Of A Child\n04.Never Thought I'd Live To Be A Hundred\n05.Beyond\n06.Out And In\n07.Candle Of Life\n08.Never Thought I'd Live To Be A Million\n09.Watching And Waiting\n10.Question\n11.Don't You Feel Small\n12.It's Up To You\n13.Minstrel's Song\n14.Dawning Is The Day\n15.Melancholy Man\n16.Procession\n17.The Story In Your Eyes\n18.One More Time To Live\n19.You Can Never Go Home\n20.My Song\n\n\nDisc 3     99.88% CDDA\n\n01.Lost In A Lost World\n02.New Horizons\n03.For My Lady\n04.Isn't Life Strange\n05.You And Me\n06.I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)\n07.This Morning\n08.Remember Me, My Friend\n09.My Brother\n10.Saved By The Music\n11.I Dreamed Last Night\n12.When You Wake Up\n13.Blue Guitar\n14.Steppin' In A Slide Zone\n15.Driftwood\n16.The Day We Meet Again\n\n\nDisc 4     99.73% CDDA\n\n01.Forever Autumn\n02.The Voice\n03.Talking Out Of Turn\n04.Gemini Dream\n05.Blue World\n06.Sitting At The Wheel\n07.Running Water\n08.Your Wildest Dreams\n09.The Other Side Of Life\n10.I Know You're Out There Somewhere\n11.No More Lies\n12.Say It With Love\n13.Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back)\n14.Lean On Me (Tonight)\n15.Highway\n\n\nDisc 5     99.89% CDDA\n\n01.This Is The Moment\n02.The Story In Your Eyes (Live)\n03.Voices In The Sky (Live)\n04.New Horizons (Live)\n05.Emily's Song (Live)\n06.Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back) (Live)\n07.Say It With Love (Live)\n08.Legend Of A Mind (Live)\n09.Gemini Dream (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb0503829de9e212cde9cc8695fda2c1fbd48ae","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+-+Time+Traveller+5+CD+Box+Set++%281994%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb0503829de9e212cde9cc8695fda2c1fbd48ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,176,80,56,41,222,158,33,44,222,156,200,105,95,218,44,31,189,72,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
