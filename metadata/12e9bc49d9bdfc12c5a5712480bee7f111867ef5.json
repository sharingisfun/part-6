Now an internationally successful motivational speaker, Nick eagerly spreads his central message: the most important goal is to find your lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purpose and to never give up, despite whatever difficulties or seemingly impossible odds stand in your way.\n\nNick tells the story of his physical disabilities and the emotional battle he endured while learning to deal with them as a child, teen, and young adult. Ã¢â‚¬Å“For the longest, loneliest time, I wondered if there was anyone on earth like me, and whether there was any purpose to my life other than pain and humiliation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nick shares how his faith in God has been his major source of strength, and he explains that once he found a sense of purposeÃ¢â‚¬â€inspiring others to better their lives and the world around them--he found the confidence to build a rewarding and productive life without limits. Let Nick inspire you to start living your own life without limits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12e9bc49d9bdfc12c5a5712480bee7f111867ef5","amp;dn":"Life+Without+Limits+-+Inspiration+For+A+Ridiculously+Good+Life+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12e9bc49d9bdfc12c5a5712480bee7f111867ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,233,188,73,217,189,252,18,197,165,113,36,128,190,231,241,17,134,126,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
