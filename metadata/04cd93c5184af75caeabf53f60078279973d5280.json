Morphyre's fusion of imaginative visuals and sound enhances and transforms the experience of listening to music on individual computers. Every Morphyre scene moves in time with your music, assessing both tempo and volume. The majority of scenes integrate an animated 3D form with a flowing patterned or reiterative background through the use of shadows and warping effects. Other scenes include tunnels, fractals, animated blocks and sketches. Every single background/foreground combination has been carefully selected for its aesthetic effect.\n\nNote: Morphyre requires an OpenGL-2.0 capable video card in order to run.\n\nInstall: Enter the name and key from the ReadMe when prompted by the installer\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cd93c5184af75caeabf53f60078279973d5280","amp;dn":"Morphyre+Visualizer+v1.17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cd93c5184af75caeabf53f60078279973d5280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,205,147,197,24,74,247,92,174,171,245,63,96,7,130,121,151,61,82,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
