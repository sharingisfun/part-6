Green, &quot;The Greek &amp; Latin Roots of English&quot;\n ISBN: 1442233273 | 2014 | EPUB | 304 pages | 5 MB\n\n Over 60 percent of all English words have Greek or Latin roots; in the vocabulary of the sciences and technology, the figure rises to over 90 percent. Through the study of the Greek and Latin roots of English, students can expand their knowledge of English vocabulary and also come to understand the ways in which the history of the English language have shaped our perceptions of the world around us. The fifth edition of The Greek &amp; Latin Roots of English maintains the book s much-praised thematic approach. After an essential overview of language history, Greek, and Latin, the book organizes vocabulary into various topics, including politics and government; psychology, medicine, and the biological sciences; literature, ancient culture, and religion; and philosophy. The fifth edition features revised cumulative exercises on tear-out pages in each chapter that reinforce both vocabulary and analytical skills from previous chapters. The fifth edition also features alphabetical vocabulary lists and other reader-friendly updates. The Greek &amp; Latin Roots of English remains an essential text to help students not only learn vocabulary, but also appreciate the pleasures (and pitfalls) of language study.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cebfafcd2813414eaa97f65b709d680b1857dc82","amp;dn":"The+Greek+%26amp%3B+Latin+Roots+of+English+-+Tamara+M.+Green.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cebfafcd2813414eaa97f65b709d680b1857dc82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,191,175,205,40,19,65,78,170,151,246,91,112,157,104,11,24,87,220,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
