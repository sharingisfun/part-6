Narrated by bestselling American author Donna Tartt, who brings &quot;True Grit&quot; - her favourite book - to life with perfect intonation, insight and suspense. There is no knowing what lies in a man's heart. On a trip to buy ponies, Frank Ross is killed by Torn Chancy, who shoots him down for a horse, $150 cash, and two gold pieces. Ross' single-minded teenage daughter, Mattie, travels to claim his body...Then she meets Rooster - a man with grit - and persuades him to join her on a deadly quest to avenge her father's murder.
