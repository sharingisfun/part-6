The reason I \n         did that was for me, a several minute silence gap is annoying. Esp when \n         listening to it mixed in with other stuff, then you got this big gap in \n         play. Anyway, enjoy\n\n**Note 2: Very different from the hidden track version on Dosage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f2b3645d6b9aac0c407ec2860563e9f738979b","amp;dn":"Collective+Soul+Discog+%5B320kbps%5D%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f2b3645d6b9aac0c407ec2860563e9f738979b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,242,179,100,93,107,154,172,12,64,126,194,134,5,99,233,247,56,151,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
