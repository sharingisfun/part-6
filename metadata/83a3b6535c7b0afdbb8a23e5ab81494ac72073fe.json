More importantly, he laid the foundation for rock and roll, which has been acknowledged by his 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nProbably the two icons who were most influenced by Jordan - by their own accounts - were James Brown and Chuck Berry. James Brown carried the mantle of Godfather of Soul (and funk), while Chuck Berry was one of the early rock pioneers.\n\nThe best way to know Jordan is to watch and listen - in these clips you can clearly hear how his small combo - Tympany Five - was the prototype for what was to become R&amp;B, as well as the foundation of what was to become soul via James Brown and Ray Charles, and rock via Chuck Berry and others Jordan heavily influenced such as Bill Halley.\n\nFather of Rhythm 'N' Blues &amp; Rock 'N' Roll album was released Jan 27, 2003 on the Universal Distribution label. &quot;Swinging in a Coconut Tree,&quot; &quot;Buzz Me,&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Dead in the Market&quot; are only a few of the songs on FATHER OF THE RHYTHM &amp; BLUES &amp; ROCK &amp; ROLL, an excellent Louis Jordan compilation.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 Swinging in a Cocoanut Tree\n2 Five Guys Named Moe See\n3 It's A Low Down Dirty Shame See\n4 Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?\n5 Caldonia Boogie\n6 Buzz Me\n7 Salt Park, West Virginia\n8 Beware\n9 Choo Choo Ch' Boogie\n10 Stone Cold Dead in the Market\n11 Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chicken\n12 Let the Good Times Roll\n13 Texas And Pacific\n14 Jack, You're Dead\n15 Reet, Petite, And Gone\n16 Early In the Morning\n17 Barnyard boogie\n18 Boogie Woogie Blue Plate\n19 Look Out\n20 Beans and Cornbread\n21 Saturday Night Fish Fry\n22 You Rascal You\n23 Blue Light Boogie\n24 Junco Partner ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a3b6535c7b0afdbb8a23e5ab81494ac72073fe","amp;dn":"Louis+Jordan+-+Father+of+Rhythm+%26amp%3B+Blues+and+Rock%27n+Roll+%5BEAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a3b6535c7b0afdbb8a23e5ab81494ac72073fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,163,182,83,92,123,10,253,187,138,35,229,171,129,73,74,199,32,115,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
