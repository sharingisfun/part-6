Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don't know where to start?\n\nThe answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about better ideas, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1877b9584d0513c8ce2256072a10608b1636533","amp;dn":"Pressfield+Steven+-+Do+the+work","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1877b9584d0513c8ce2256072a10608b1636533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,135,123,149,132,208,81,60,140,226,37,96,114,161,6,8,177,99,101,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
