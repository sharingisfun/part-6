Chaplin reissued it with \n                 synchronized music and narration in 1942. He removed all the \n                 titles, rearranged some sequences and discarded several scenes. \n                 The original 1925 version disappeared. But a 35mm copy had been\n                 made by a private collector. By using this together with the\n                 1942 reissue, and three fragments preserved by the National \n                 Film and Television Archive, it has been possible to reconstruct \n                 the film almost exactly as Chaplin first released it. The picture\n                 quality varies considerably between the different sources. The \n                 subtitles have been remade with the original wording. This is an\n                 opportunity to see Chaplin's masterpiece close to its original \n                 form, but it should still be regarded as 'work in progress'. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b97e2a08fdd8dc7f95f251273bf624dcc52ab8","amp;dn":"The.Gold.Rush.1925.Original.Cut.CRITERION.720p.BluRay.x264-MySiL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b97e2a08fdd8dc7f95f251273bf624dcc52ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,185,126,42,8,253,216,220,127,149,242,81,39,59,246,36,220,197,42,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
