Suddenly, counselors are being maimed and slaughtered in various ways by the backwoodsman who has returned when his name was called.\n\n&quot;Madman&quot; starts with the typical scene of teens sitting around the campfire listening to scary tales. A head of camp, Max tells them the true story of Madman Marz. Marz was a brutal farmer who lived in the house by the campsite and who beat his wife and two kids. During one such fight he even had part of his nose bitten off! One night the freaky farmer took his axe and chopped up his family as they slept, and for such a nasty deed the locals decided to whack him across the face with his axe and string him up from a tree. One their return they find Marz has vanished,taking the bodies of his family with him. Now it's said he roams the woods looking for people to chop and string up. If you say his name above a whisper... Madman Marz will get you! \n\n&quot;Madman&quot; is a typical early 80's slasher flick that provides some genuine chills. The cinematography is surprisingly striking with some lovely blue tinged night scenes. Madman Marz is a really creepy psycho and there is plenty of gore including a messy throat slashing, a nasty axe in the chest murder plus a couple of severed heads. The ending is surprisingly downbeat and the action is fast-paced. Give this wonderful slasher flick a chance.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GIFg2u1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GIFg2u1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0ede9d544ec07a0ee89840e8eefb70d2c3a49a","amp;dn":"Madman+%5B1982%2C+Joe+Giannone%2C+DVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0ede9d544ec07a0ee89840e8eefb70d2c3a49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,14,222,157,84,78,192,122,14,232,152,64,232,238,251,112,210,195,164,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
