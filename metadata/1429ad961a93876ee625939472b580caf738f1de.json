Unlike other content review books, it builds content right into vivid case studies to foster greater retention of the material. Additionally, because these case studies evolve over time, they mimic real-life situations and help students to develop critical thinking and organizational skills.\n\nThe Review features, in great depth, the spectrum of requisite community health nursing information with the inclusion of current Quality &amp; Safety Education (QSEN) competencies. It covers patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, safety, and informatics. The Review is enhanced by such mobile device resources as PubMed and AHRQ guidelines to simulate the method nurses currently use to access clinical information. These web links and resources are incorporated into the unfolding cases to further replicate realistic clinical situations in which the point-of-care/point-of-need access to information is used for decision support. Community Health Nursing Test Success will serve as both a course review and NCLEX-RN review with embedded links to access further information. It includes over 200 NCLEX-style questions in a variety of formats.\n\nKey Features:\nUses unfolding case studies to mimic actual practice situations\nEmbeds content into unfolding case studies to facilitate active learning\nUses mobile device resources to simulate a true clinical environment\nServes as both a course review and an NCLEX-RN review\nBuilds web links and resources into unfolding case studies to replicate realistic clinical situations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1429ad961a93876ee625939472b580caf738f1de","amp;dn":"Community+Health+Nursing+Test+Success+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1429ad961a93876ee625939472b580caf738f1de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,41,173,150,26,147,135,110,230,37,147,148,114,181,128,202,247,56,241,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
