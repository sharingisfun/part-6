For the first time, he gives an intimate look at his family background, his battles with drugs, his life of crime, his relentless suffering with sickle-cell anemia, and much more. Recently released after serving three and a half years in state prison due to what many consider an unlawful arrest by a rumored secret NYPD hip hop task force, Prodigy is ready to talk about his life as one of rapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest legends. \n\nMy Infamous Life is an unblinking account of ProdigyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild times with Mobb Deep who, alongside rappers like Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan, changed the musical landscape with their vivid portrayals of early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s street life. It is a firsthand chronicle of legendary rap feuds like the East CoastÃ¢â‚¬â€œWest Coast rivalry; ProdigyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beefs with Jay-Z, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ja Rule, and Capone-N-Noreaga; and run-ins with prodigal hit makers and managers like Puff Daddy, Russell Simmons, Chris Lighty, Irv Gotti, and Lyor Cohen. \n\nTaking the reader behind the smoke-and-mirrors glamour of the hip hop world, so often seen as the only way out for those with few options, Prodigy lays down the truth about the intoxicating power of money, the meaning of true friendship and loyalty, and the ultimately redemptive power of self. This is the heartbreaking journey of a child born in privilege, his youth spent among music royalty like Diana Ross and Dizzy Gillespie, educated in private schools, until a family tragedy changed everything. Raised in the mayhem of the Queensbridge projects, Prodigy rose to the dizzying heights of fame and eventually fell into the darkness of a prison cell. \n\nA truly candid memoir, part fearless confessional and part ode to the concrete jungles of New York City, My Infamous Life is written by a man who was on the front line of the last great moment in hip hop history and who is still fighting to achieve his very own American Dream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0efe5ca68c255284a71f71a872e63d16d48db4","amp;dn":"My+Infamous+Life-+Mobb+Deep%27s+Prodigy+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0efe5ca68c255284a71f71a872e63d16d48db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,14,254,92,166,140,37,82,132,167,31,113,168,114,230,61,22,212,141,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
