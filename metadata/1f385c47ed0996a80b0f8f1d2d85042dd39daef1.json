The different versions are selectable from the game launcher. All Trine purchases have been automatically updated to Trine Enchanted Edition.\nTrine is a physics-based action game where three characters combine their powers to devise clever solutions to challenges created by hazardous puzzles and threatening enemies. The gameplay is based on fully interactive physics where each character's different abilities and tactics can be used to invent new ways to overcome obstacles and save the kingdom!\nThe single-player game is fantastic fun, but Trine is one of those games best played with a friend in co-op mode. Finding solutions in a synergy of different character skills, perfectly timing your actions, and solving puzzles together with your co-op partner is the kind of truly rewarding feeling that only the best co-op games can elicit.\nMany indie games get by with a minimalist approach to graphics and audio, making a virtue of limited resources and focusing solely on gameplay. Trine is not one of those games. It has stunning visuals and captivating audio; together, they create an enchanting combination that is almost hypnotically beautiful. Trine is a very unique experience, a slick combination of puzzle and platformer games with brilliantly executed co-operative mode.This is a great choice for anyone looking for a game that is not only fun and eye-candy but also keeps your brain pleasantly occupied.\nWinner of Best Downloadable Game (GameSpot's E3 Editors' Choice Awards) 2009.\nEnchanting visuals, beautiful music, and stunning attention to detail throughout the entire adventure.\nPolished and fluid game mechanics make the puzzle solving process a very enjoyable and rewarding experience.\n\nMinimum system requirements:\nWindows: Windows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz CPU (Dual Core recommended)\nMemory: 1 GB\nHard Disk Space: 3.75 GB\nVideo Card: ATi Radeon HD 2400 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 or better (Shader Model 3.0 needs to be supported)\nDirectXÃ‚Â®: 9.0c\nSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f385c47ed0996a80b0f8f1d2d85042dd39daef1","amp;dn":"Trine+Enchanted+Edition+%28v2.1.1.6%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f385c47ed0996a80b0f8f1d2d85042dd39daef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,56,92,71,237,9,150,168,11,15,143,29,45,133,4,45,211,157,174,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
