It felt like the duo burned their music down to the ground with 2006's abrasive Varcharz, after which they seemingly disappeared. This lengthy absence paid off: Parastrophics reveals just how much Mouse on Mars' sophisticated mischief was missed while they were gone, and testifies to just how malleable yet distinctive their music is.  Despite its density, there's a sleekness to Parastrophics' tracks that feels timeless and immediate. Metrotopy's glistening textures and ping-ponging percussion are majestic and nimble at the same time, with an underlying funkiness that comes to the fore on some of the album's other stand-out tracks. Polaroyced's massive bassline and rubbery melody nod to classic electro, albeit in a warped MoM way, while Syncropticians's satisfying squish and Gearknot Cherry's tight syncopation have a kinship with Debruit and Hudson Mohawke's post-funk workouts. Ultimately, though, Mouse on Mars sound only like themselves on Parastrophics, an album that's a rebirth and a welcome return for one of electronic music's most restlessly creative acts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a5d85276c8bbeccf8ea608e047126b87beedc1","amp;dn":"Mouse+on+Mars+-+Parastrophics+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a5d85276c8bbeccf8ea608e047126b87beedc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,165,216,82,118,200,187,236,207,142,166,8,224,71,18,107,135,190,237,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
