She becomes a star attraction, and a romance develops between them. Complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera. Meanwhile, Blackie's childhood friend, Roman Catholic Father Tim Mullen (Spencer Tracy), keeps trying to reform him, while the other nightclub owners attempt to convince Norton to run for the City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors in order to protect their crooked interests.\n\nDespite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist until the famous 1906 earthquake devastates the city. He &quot;finds God&quot; upon discovering that Mary survived.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028216/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028216/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21535&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21535&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n        Clark Gable\t ... \tBlackie Norton\n\n\tJeanette MacDonald\t... \tMary Blake\n\n\tSpencer Tracy\t... \tFather Mullin\n\tJack Holt\t... \tJack Burley\n\tJessie Ralph\t... \tMrs. Burley\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:55:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 528x400\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1292 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,26 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569ecafbd5841fe31dc7ee6acb051f96b9d7f593","amp;dn":"San+Francisco+%281936%29+Clark+Gable%2C+Spencer+Tracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569ecafbd5841fe31dc7ee6acb051f96b9d7f593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,158,202,251,213,132,31,227,29,199,238,106,203,5,31,150,185,215,245,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
