In fact, it wasn't until that movement's late-'90s decline that the band's dogged persistence finally paid off, when their fourth album, Powertrip, catapulted to gold sales status on the strength of its massive hard rock hit, &quot;Space Lord.&quot; In the meantime, Monster Magnet had managed to become one of the most successful and influential bands associated with the so-called underground &quot;stoner rock&quot; scene. And yet, their influences span much further than that scene's foundations in '70s hard rock and metal, delving into space rock, psychedelia, and beyond. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Tractor\n02.Medicine\n03.Dopes To Infinity\n04.Melt\n05.Space Lord\n06.Powertrip\n07.Atomic Clock\n08.Heads Explode\n09.Bummer\n10.Negasonic Teenage Warhead\n11.Dead Christmas\n12.Silver Future\n13.Black Balloon\n14.Crop Circle\n15.Kiss Of The Scorpion\n16.Space Lord (Intergalactic 7&quot; Mix)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cadef8196ff2563369477c102fd19ce5cc72834","amp;dn":"Monster+Magnet+-+Greatest+Hits+%282003%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cadef8196ff2563369477c102fd19ce5cc72834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,173,239,129,150,255,37,99,54,148,119,193,2,253,25,206,92,199,40,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
