Nottola (Rod Steiger) manipulates corrupt local government officials in the political instability that plagues Italy following World War II. The only councilman who tries to block the shady deals in defense of the people is the lone Communist elected to the board. The only insight on the characters is shown by the political machinations undertaken and the final result of the new zoning laws that followed the tangle of secret deals, bribes and blackmail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75cbce232cc6bd92993fb02f39eef504afc64214","amp;dn":"Francesco+Rosi+-+Le+Mani+sulla+citt%26agrave%3B+AKA+Hands+Over+the+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75cbce232cc6bd92993fb02f39eef504afc64214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,203,206,35,44,198,189,146,153,63,176,47,57,238,245,4,175,198,66,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
