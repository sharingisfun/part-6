Marx said himself that his aim was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto bring a science [i.e. political economy] by criticism to the point where it can be dialectically representedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and in this way to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreveal the law of motion of modern societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. By showing how capitalist development was the precursor of a new, socialist mode of production, he aimed to provide a scientific foundation for the modern labour movement. In preparation for his book, he studied the economic literature available in his time for a period of twelve years, mainly in the British Museum in London. \n\nPLEASE HELP SEEDING, THIS FILE IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe57b0075d4c0fd4de8689c9ddc8ccd5992f9ff0","amp;dn":"Karl+Marx+-+The+Capital+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe57b0075d4c0fd4de8689c9ddc8ccd5992f9ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,87,176,7,93,76,15,212,222,134,137,201,221,200,204,213,153,47,159,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
