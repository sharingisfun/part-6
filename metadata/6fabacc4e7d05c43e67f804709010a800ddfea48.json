The course explains the fundamentals of sound waves, and amplitude, explores common compressor controls, and shows how to eliminate unwanted noise using gates and expanders. The course also demonstrates best practices in compression and limiting in a variety of audio applications and covers sculpting the attack and decay of individual notes with transient shapers and applying frequency specific dynamics control with multiband compressors. Exercise files accompany the course and include special Get in the Mix session files.\nTopics include:\n\n    Measuring amplitude\n    Understanding dynamic range\n    Introducing compressors\n    Utilizing compression ratios\n    Applying attack and release\n    Evening out a vocal performance with compression\n    Adding punch and sustain to drums\n    Using compression presets intelligently\n    How to record with compression\n    Solving common mix problems with limiters\n    De-essing a vocal track\n    Using gates and expanders\n    Controlling frequency content with multiband compressors\n    Using sidechains creatively\n    Keying gates and compressors\n    Fixing overcompressed tracks\n    Using mixbus compression\n    Working with parallel compression\n    Compression and limiting best practices","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fabacc4e7d05c43e67f804709010a800ddfea48","amp;dn":"%5Bb%5DLynda+-+Foundations+of+Audio%3A+Compression+and+Dynamic+Process","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fabacc4e7d05c43e67f804709010a800ddfea48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,171,172,196,231,208,92,67,230,127,128,71,9,1,10,128,13,223,234,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
