There was still a light air of wit here and there, but this trio was looking to focus on the more serious side of life, which continued with 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dirty Acres. The fans who loved CunninLynguistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ goofier style were quickly appeased, though, with the two Strange Journey mixtape-style albums in 2009. But for their fifth proper album, it appears Kno, Deacon the Villain, and Natti are returning to the serious subject matter. As the album title indicates, Oneirology will deal with the science of dreaming, from the stages of sleep to dreaming disorders and everything in between.\n\nLabel: RBC\nGenre: Rap\nQuality: VBR MP3 @ 189 kbps avg\nTime: 0h 50min Total\nSize: 68MB\n\nTracklist:\n01.
