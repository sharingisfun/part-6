Each year, fewer Americans can afford it, fewer businesses can provide it, and fewer government programs can promise it for future generations.\n\nWe need a cure, and we need it now.\n\nHarvard Business SchoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Clayton M. Christensen - whose bestselling The InnovatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dilemma revolutionized the business world - presents The InnovatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prescription, a comprehensive analysis of the strategies that will improve health care and make it affordable.\n\nChristensen applies the principles of disruptive innovation to the broken health care system with two pioneers in the field - Dr. Jerome Grossman and Dr. Jason Hwang. Together, they examine a range of symptoms and offer proven solutions.\n\nYou'll discover how:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Precision medicineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reduces costs and makes good on the promise of personalized care\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Disruptive business models improve quality, accessibility, and affordability by changing the way hospitals and doctors work\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patient networks enable better treatment of chronic diseases\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Employers can change the roles they play in health care to compete effectively in the era of globalization\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Insurance and regulatory reforms stimulate disruption in health care","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363c9579e5330f5b7357f0d5da51ff8a27e0ac8e","amp;dn":"The+Innovator%27s+Prescription+%28Clayton+M.+Christensen%29+Retail+epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363c9579e5330f5b7357f0d5da51ff8a27e0ac8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,60,149,121,229,51,15,91,115,87,240,213,218,81,255,138,39,224,172,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
