His first album, The Sound of Fury (released in 1960), has become a landmark record in British rock 'n' roll history.\r\nBorn in Liverpool during the Second World War, Ronnie Wycherley became an overnight sensation in 1958 when he was asked to go on stage and sing a couple of his self-penned songs by showbiz impresario Larry Parnes. Ronnie's knees shook with nerves, but over 2,000 screaming girls welcomed the new star of British rock 'n' roll and the headline in the local newspaper the following day was 'Dingle boy with a hot guitar'.\r\nWith more Top 40 hits than the Beatles during the 1960s, Billy Fury's major hits included Halfway to Paradise, Wondrous Place, Jealousy, Last Night Was Made For Love and many more.\r\nAged just 42, Billy died of heart failure after a recording session. But his fans have never forgotten him, and every year on the anniversary of his death they gather to pay their tributes at Mill Hill cemetery. Lord Puttnam sums up Fury's contribution to modern music in the programme by saying that, 'without Billy Fury, I honestly don't think the Beatles would have happened'.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/Billy-Fury-The-Sound-of-Fury-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2641Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 86 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.68 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077x1fk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924e4dffbc4ec8b7392a3ea88ffa5fb27405e8ac","amp;dn":"BBC+Billy+Fury+The+Sound+of+Fury+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924e4dffbc4ec8b7392a3ea88ffa5fb27405e8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,78,77,255,188,78,200,183,57,42,62,168,143,250,95,178,116,5,232,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
