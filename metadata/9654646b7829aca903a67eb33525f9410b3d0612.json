Was the lightbulb really Thomas Edison's bright idea?\n* Best-selling author Leland Gregory employs his masterful wit to expose historical myths, faux &quot;facts,&quot; strange events, and tales of human stupidity throughout history.\nIf it would shock you to learn that Benjamin Franklin didn't discover electricity, you'll appreciate this take on hundreds of historical legends and debacles. Historians and humorists alike may be surprised to learn that:\n* Samuel Prescott made the famous horseback ride into Concord, not Paul Revere.\n* As a member of Parliament, Isaac Newton spoke only once. He asked for an open window.\n* On April 24, 1898, Spain declared war on the U.S., thus starting the Spanish-American War. The U.S. declared war the very next day, but not wanting to be outdone, had the date on the declaration changed from April 25 to April 21.\nWith these and many other stories, leading humorist Leland Gregory once again highlights both the strange and the funny side of humankind. \nGenre: Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9654646b7829aca903a67eb33525f9410b3d0612","amp;dn":"Stupid+History_+Tales+of+Stupidity%2C+Stra+-+Leland+Gregory.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9654646b7829aca903a67eb33525f9410b3d0612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,84,100,107,120,41,172,169,3,166,126,179,53,37,249,65,11,61,6,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
