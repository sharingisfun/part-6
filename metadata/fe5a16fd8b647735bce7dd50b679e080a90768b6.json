But the mysteries she pens are no match for the one her family is about to endureâ€¦\r\n\r\nOne midsummerâ€™s eve, after a beautiful party drawing hundreds of guests to the estate has ended, the Edevanes discover that their youngest child, eleven-month-old Theo, has vanished without a trace. What follows is a tragedy that tears the family apart in ways they never imagined.\r\n\r\nDecades later, Alice is living in London, having enjoyed a long successful career as an author. Theoâ€™s case has never been solved, though Alice still harbors a suspicion as to the culprit. Miles away, Sadie Sparrow, a young detective in the London police force, is staying at her grandfatherâ€™s house in Cornwall. While out walking one day, she stumbles upon the old estateâ€”now crumbling and covered with vines, clearly abandoned long ago.
