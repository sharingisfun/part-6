The game might appear simple at first\r\nbut it is full of depth, details and of course monsters\r\n\r\nThe main focus in CoE4 is that each race plays differently. We're\r\nnot talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking\r\nabout completely differently, with different mechanics and\r\ndifferent goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on\r\namassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest\r\ningredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need\r\nto conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are\r\nmines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost\r\nentirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible\r\nsince they are so difficult to replace. With 20 different factions\r\nthat alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for\r\ncontrol of the map to conquer Elysium\r\n\r\nNew for the 4th version of Conquest of Elysium is the addition of\r\ndifferent planes, many new rituals, monster descriptions, a\r\ncompletely new battle system, new random maps with varying\r\ntemperatures and much more\r\n\r\nThe game has six different planes. There is for instance an\r\nInfernal plane that is the home of the devils and the demons. So if\r\na demonologist manages to summon a demon lord, there will suddenly\r\nbe a dark citadel without its master in inferno. Banishing a devil\r\nwill now force it back to inferno instead of slaying it\r\npermanently. Although extremely difficult it is possible to\r\npermanently destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it\r\non that plane. Although there are many planes now you will only\r\nrarely have to visit them. But they continue to run in the\r\nbackground and can make certain actions or random events more\r\nexciting\r\n\r\nMost factions start with a random set of rituals, a random set of\r\ncombat spell and together with the random map that will ensure that\r\nno two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be learned\r\nduring the game if you have the right resources and find the right\r\nlocations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium\r\nthere's also random events to contend with, from bumper harvests\r\nand bandits, to the very gates of the underworld opening into\r\nElysium. Your hands will be full before you even make contact with\r\nthe enemy\r\n\r\n1. Unzip &amp; Unrar\r\n2. Install the Game\r\n3. Have Fun!!!!\r\n\r\nRIPPED: &quot;NOTHING&quot;\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n1.
