Lagowski (AP, 1970).pdf\r\n\r\nThe Chemistry of Nonaqueous Solvents, Volume III: Inert, Aprotic, and Acidic Solvents is a compilation of critical surveys of specific solvent systems. The compendium contains discussions on the solution chemistry of sulfur dioxide and acyl halides; the solvent properties of hydrogen sulfide and carboxylic acids; and the Bronsted acid-base behavior in inert organic solvents. Chemists, researchers, and students of chemistry and chemical engineering will find the book a good reference material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33d6df831daa990b84a7a1ccbb65f7f609e5a6d","amp;dn":"The+Chemistry+of+Nonaqueous+Solvents+Vol.+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33d6df831daa990b84a7a1ccbb65f7f609e5a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,61,109,248,49,218,169,144,184,74,122,28,203,182,95,127,96,158,90,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
