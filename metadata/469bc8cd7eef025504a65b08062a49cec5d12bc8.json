I bought this one for several reasons. One: it contains 18 songs, which is a lot more than most compilations. No skimping on songs here! :) Two: it contains a majority of songs that are fast and truly get you into the toe-tapping, boot-scooting mood. I happen to be a line dancer so I especially like these selections. And finally, I like this CD because it has a good variety of songs from groups as well as solo artists, men as well as women.\n\nMy only critique is that some of the transitions between songs were very choppily done, such as one song starting right on the heels of another without a break. The transition between tracks 14 and 15 is the best (worst?) example: they completely cut off the end of Trace Adkins' &quot;This Ain't No Thinkin Thing.&quot; But overall, I would definitely recommend this CD to any fans of &quot;hot country&quot; music. You will get lots of enjoyment from it.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - Ultimate Country Party\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Ultimate Country Party\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 277kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
