They have been called the greatest Scottish band ever, and are one of the most celebrated groups of the 1990s. Belle &amp; Sebastian are often compared to influential indie bands such as The Smiths, as well as classic rock acts such as Love, Bob Dylan and Nick Drake. The name Belle &amp; Sebastian is inspired by Belle et SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bastien, a children's book by French writer CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile Aubry. Lauded by critics, Belle &amp; Sebastian's &quot;wistful pop&quot; has nevertheless enjoyed only limited commercial success.\n\nAfter releasing a number of albums and EPs on Jeepster Records, they are now signed to Rough Trade Records in the United Kingdom and Matador Records in the United States.\n\n    Tigermilk (1996)\n    If You're Feeling Sinister (1996)\n    The Boy with the Arab Strap (1998)\n    Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant (2000)\n    Storytelling (2002)\n    Dear Catastrophe Waitress (2003)\n    The Life Pursuit (2006)\n\nSEED and Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e62f8b5a8074ba1309093d354cc58db0710091ae","amp;dn":"Belle+%26+Sebastian+-+7+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e62f8b5a8074ba1309093d354cc58db0710091ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,47,139,90,128,116,186,19,9,9,61,53,76,197,141,176,113,0,145,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
