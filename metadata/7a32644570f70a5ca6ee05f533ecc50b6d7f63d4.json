In this incredible collection of actual government documents, Ventura, the ultimate non- partisan truth-seeker, proves it beyond any doubt. He and Dick Russell walk readers through 63 of the most incriminating programs to reveal what really happens behind the closed doors. In addition to providing original government data, Ventura discusses what it really means and how regular Americans can stop criminal behavior at the top levels of government and in the media. Among the cases discussed:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The CIAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top-secret program to control human behavior\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Operation NorthwoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the military plan to hijack airplanes and blame it on Cuban terrorists\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The discovery of a secret Afghan archiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½information that never left the boardroom\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Potentially deadly healthcare cover-ups, including a dengue fever outbreak\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ What the Department of Defense knows about our food supplyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but is keeping mum\n\nAlthough these documents are now in the public domain, the powers that be would just as soon they stay under wraps. VenturaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s research and commentary sheds new light on what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not telling youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and why it matters.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJesse Ventura\nis the former governor of Minnesota and author of several bestselling books, including DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Start the Revolution Without Me! and American Conspiracies.
