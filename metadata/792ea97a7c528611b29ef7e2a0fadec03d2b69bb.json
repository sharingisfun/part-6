Often the target is the individual's spouse. The program is edited in a documentary style, using a central voice-over narration by reporter Sharon Martin, as well as interviews with people in possession of first-hand knowledge of the case, including law-enforcement officials, lawyers, journalists, friends and family members of both the victims and the accused, and at times the criminals themselves.\n\n1.Celeste Beard Johnson\n2.Virginia Larzelere\n3.Clara Harris\n4.Elana Kiejliches\n5.Kimberly Hricko\n6.Lee Ann Reidel\n7.Ruthan Aron\n8.Joyce Lemay Cohen\n9.Diane Zamora\n10.Susan Wright\n11.Kristin Rossum\n12.Debra Lynn Baker\n13.Carolyn Warmus\n\nDownloaded From http://www.10-84.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792ea97a7c528611b29ef7e2a0fadec03d2b69bb","amp;dn":"Snapped+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792ea97a7c528611b29ef7e2a0fadec03d2b69bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,46,169,122,124,82,134,17,178,158,247,226,160,250,222,192,61,43,105,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
