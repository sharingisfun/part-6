Gerard Depardieu stars as Onoff, a famed author who has become a recluse in recent years, publishing nothing. Late one night he is picked up by police officers, who find him running across the French countryside in the rain, breathless and apparently suffering from short-term memory loss. A murder has been committed in the nearby woods, and suspecting Onoff's involvement, the authorities detain him at a leaky, dark command post to await the arrival of an inspector (Roman Polanski), ironically a fan of Onoff's work, who will interrogate his subject and try to arrive at the truth. Una Pura Formalita (1994) was produced simultaneously with Polanski's Death and the Maiden (1994), another film with a stage-bound quality featuring a long, stormy night's interrogation in a single room.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Una pura formalita.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,585,920,000 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:46:56\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x304 (AR: 2.368)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1515 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.277 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110917/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110917/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Italian or French (2 audio channels)\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese\n\nPosted originally at KG by Vertigen, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704e55567bcdf9a0c34bb169a078e172a9003c4d","amp;dn":"Una+pura+formalita+%28Giuseppe+Tornatore%2C+1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704e55567bcdf9a0c34bb169a078e172a9003c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,78,85,86,123,205,249,160,195,75,177,105,160,120,225,114,169,0,60,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
