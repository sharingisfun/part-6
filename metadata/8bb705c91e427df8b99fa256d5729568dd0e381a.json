On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether itâ€™s across Massachusetts or across the country.\r\n\r\nCharles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing â€“ and terrifying â€“ playground of amusements he calls â€œChristmasland.â€\r\n\r\nThen, one day, Vic goes looking for troubleâ€”and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manxâ€™s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. Heâ€™s on the road again and heâ€™s picked up a new passenger: Vicâ€™s own son.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb705c91e427df8b99fa256d5729568dd0e381a","amp;dn":"Joe+Hill+-+NOS4A2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb705c91e427df8b99fa256d5729568dd0e381a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,183,5,201,30,66,125,248,185,159,162,86,213,114,149,104,221,14,56,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
