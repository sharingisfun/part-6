The group was formed\nin Philadelphia in 1971, when the sisters' ages ranged from 12 to 16, and they recorded their\nfirst single, &quot;Time Will Tell,&quot; for the Philly-based Money Back label. (For the first few years,\nthe group called itself Sisters Sledge.) In 1972, Sister Sledge signed with Atco and recorded\nits second single, &quot;Weatherman,&quot; which was followed by the Jackson 5-like &quot;Mama Never Told Me&quot; in 1973.\n\nSister Sledge's first national hit came in 1974, when &quot;Love, Don't You Go Through No Changes on Me&quot;\nreached number 31 on the R&amp;B charts and the Philadelphians recorded their debut album, Circle of Love.\nTheir second album, Together, was released in 1977 and contained the number 61 R&amp;B hit\n&quot;Blockbuster Boy.&quot; It wasn't until 1979, when Chic leaders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards\nproduced We Are Family, that Sister Sledge really exploded commercially. &quot;He's the Greatest Dancer&quot;\nand We Are Family's title song both soared to number one on the R&amp;B charts, and the latter\n(a number two pop smash) was adopted as a theme by the World Series-winning Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nSister Sledge's next album, Love Somebody Today (1980), was also produced by the Rodgers/Edwards\nteam, and the single &quot;Got to Love Somebody&quot; became a number six R&amp;B hit. In 1981, Sister Sledge switched\nproducers and worked with Narada Michael Walden, who produced 1981's excellent All American Girls.\nThe title song was a number three R&amp;B hit, and in 1982, Sister Sledge had a number 14 R&amp;B hit with a\ncover of Mary Wells' &quot;My Guy&quot; that appeared on The Sisters. But after that, the foursome's popularity faded,\nand it never had another Top 20 hit in the U.S. -- although 1985's &quot;Frankie&quot; (a number 32 R&amp;B hit in the States)\nbecame a pop number one hit in England. Sister Sledge left Atlantic for good in 1985, but its members kept busy\nin the 1990s. Epic released Kathy's debut solo album, Heart, in 1992, and 1997 found the sisters recording a\nrisk-taking date, African Eyes, arguably one of the finest albums they ever recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Review (c/o Discogs)\n\nSister Sledge's finest moment and a Disco record that is always guaranteed to\nbring the house down. These House mixes do an excellent job in respecting the\noriginal and beefing up the tune to be played on House floors. Mike Pickering\nused to dig this out in the early 90s at the Hacienda and always play it at the\nend of the night. A perfect anthem that encapsulates that lost in hedonism\nfeeling on a dancefloor.
