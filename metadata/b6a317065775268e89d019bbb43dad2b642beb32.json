Like Clerks, Pi was shot on extremely grainy black and white film. The heavy grain present throughout the movie is intentional and it *not* an encoding issue. In fact, special x264 settings used for heavy grain (negative de-block, disabling dct decimate, etc) were implemented for this encode, in addition to increasing the bitrate substantially compared to my other 1080p's in order to preserve the intended and original look of the film. You're seeing the film exactly as it's intended to be seen.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\nAs of now, this is the only low file size 1080p encode of this movie, so please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a317065775268e89d019bbb43dad2b642beb32","amp;dn":"Pi+%281998%29+%5B1080p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a317065775268e89d019bbb43dad2b642beb32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,163,23,6,87,117,38,142,137,208,25,187,180,61,173,43,100,43,235,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
