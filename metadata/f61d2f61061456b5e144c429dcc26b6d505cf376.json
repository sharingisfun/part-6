The film has little plot, the feel of a documentary, and most of the scenes are perfunctory. Nonetheless, &quot;Lamerica&quot; will beg a strange fascination from those who find grizzled realism interesting. \n\nRip Specs\n\nVideo codec: XVID\nVideo resolution: 720x320\nVideo framerate: 29,97 fps\n\nAudio channels: 2\nAudio samplerate: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate: 192 kb/s\n\nDuration: 1:50:36\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110299&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Albanian / Italian\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nOriginally posted at KG by epta\n\nGianni Amelio - Lamerica (1994)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61d2f61061456b5e144c429dcc26b6d505cf376","amp;dn":"Gianni+Amelio+-+Lamerica+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61d2f61061456b5e144c429dcc26b6d505cf376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,29,47,97,6,20,86,181,225,68,196,41,220,194,107,109,80,92,243,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
