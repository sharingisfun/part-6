In this course, David Gassner shows you how to prepare, package, and publish your Android app on Google Play, and provides a brief overview of the alternatives offered by Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. The first step is to prepare the app for distribution, including cleaning up code, adding licensing and encryption, and exporting an application package (APK) file. The course then shows how to register as an Android developer, upload your app, set pricing, and publish the app. You'll also learn how to track app usage, including usage statistics, revenue, and crash reporting. David also includes a chapter on using Amazon's developer portal to distribute your app through the Amazon Appstore.\nTopics include:\n\n    Packaging an Android app\n    Distributing through Google vs. Amazon vs. Barnes &amp; Noble\n    Exporting the APK file\n    Testing the app\n    Shrinking and protecting an app with ProGuard\n    Creating and uploading screenshots to Google Play\n    Adding in-app products\n    Tracking app usage and revenue\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc95671a9e2f6d499f0840c3b5c37db371dcd7c","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Distributing+Android+Apps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc95671a9e2f6d499f0840c3b5c37db371dcd7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,201,86,113,169,226,246,212,153,240,132,12,59,92,55,219,55,29,205,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
