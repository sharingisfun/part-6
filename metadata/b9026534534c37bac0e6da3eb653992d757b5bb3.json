Fourteen year old Augusten Burroughs narrates the story of his love\nhate relationship with his mother, Deirdre Burroughs. As a child, Augusten\nloved and wanted to be like his theatrical acting mother, who aspires to\nbe a famous writer, with her person being more renowned than her writing.\nShe is critical of writers in general while not achieving that wanted fame\nbecause of not being a gifted enough a writer. Her writing is fueled\nlargely by her manic depression. Augusten's now divorced parents had a\nturbulent relationship, his alcoholic father, Norman Burroughs, who is\nnow largely out of his life by Norm's own choice. To deal with her mental\nissues, Deirdre has been seeing therapist Dr. Finch, whose actions are\nlargely motivated by a singular issue. Out of circumstance, Augusten\nstrikes a relationship with Dr. Finch's disparate but completely eccentric\nfamily: his quietly nervous wife, Agnes Finch; religiously fanatic eldest\ndaughter Hope; rebellious younger daughter Natalie; and thirty-five year\nold recently adopted son Neil Bookman, who was and still is one of his\npatients. In Norm's self-imposed abandonment and Deirdre's own dealings\nwith her unstable mental state, Augusten reluctantly finds in the Finches\na surrogate family, far from the normal family within which he dreams for\nhimself. But in his relationship with the Finches, Augusten will learn\nwhere he wants his mother to fit in his life, and what he has to do for\nhimself to have the life he wants given the cards he was dealt. He will\nalso find that he has a kindred soul who was not obvious to him at\nfirst glance.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Joseph Cross.\n=&gt;-Annette Bening.\n=&gt;-Brian Cox.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Ryan Murphy.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2006.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.53 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 795 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 1mn.\n=&gt;-Running with Scissors......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/running_with_scissors/\n=&gt;-Running with Scissors......: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/running-with-scissors/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1 280 x 528.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1678 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 158 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9026534534c37bac0e6da3eb653992d757b5bb3","amp;dn":"Running+With+Scissors+-+Comedy+2006+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9026534534c37bac0e6da3eb653992d757b5bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,2,101,52,83,76,55,186,192,230,218,62,182,83,153,45,117,123,91,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
