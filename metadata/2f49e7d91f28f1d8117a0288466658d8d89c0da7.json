She cannot speak the Ariekei tongue, but she is an indelible part of it, having long ago been made a figure of speech, a living simile in their language.\n\nWhen distant political machinations deliver a new ambassador to Arieka, the fragile equilibrium between humans and aliens is violently upset. Catastrophe looms, and Avice is torn between competing loyaltiesÃ¢â‚¬â€to a husband she no longer loves, to a system she no longer trusts, and to her place in a language she cannot speak yet speaks through her.\n\nRead by Susan Duerden\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f49e7d91f28f1d8117a0288466658d8d89c0da7","amp;dn":"China+Mi%26eacute%3Bville+-+Embassytown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f49e7d91f28f1d8117a0288466658d8d89c0da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,73,231,217,31,40,241,216,17,122,2,136,70,102,88,216,216,156,13,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
