They cover an eclectic and stimulating range of subjects from Henry James and Somerset Maugham to Ho Chi Minh and Kim Philby.  Never dull, even when at his most controversial, Greene illuminates questions of literature and questions of faith with equal ease and wit.\n\n&quot;A man should be judged by his enmities as well as his friendships,&quot; Greene wrote.  In that sense, COLLECTED ESSAYS is as revealing as autobiography and as characteristically rich in humour, insight and doubt.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;A triumph of a collection . . . wise and stimulating.&quot; -- Guardian\n\n&quot;He was, he is, the best of critics.&quot; -- Dilys Powell Guardian\n\n&quot;Opening a new book by Graham Greene is like settling into a gran turismo car.
