No query about life or the universe is too random or silly for science\nadventurer Greg Foot. So if you've ever wondered why the sky is blue, how to survive a lightning\nstrike, or even how many helium balloons it takes to lift a human, then this is the show for you.\nSecrets of Everything uses brilliantly simple lo-fi demonstrations, hi-tech kit and extreme stunts\nto explore the weird science behind everything from belly flops to black holes, Greg turns\nnon-scientists into eager enthusiasts and reveals just how mysterious and incredible our world\nreally is.\n\n\n1) Part 1\nDaredevil science geek Greg Foot is prepared to attempt anything to find answers to some of life's\nweirder frequently-asked questions. In the first episode of this irreverent, stunt-filled series,\nGreg suffers to find out what humans taste of, heads to Reading Festival to work out whether the\nhuman race could actually shift the planet by jumping at exactly the same time, and finds out\nwhether a bellyflop could kill you.\nAlong the way he is struck by lightning and 'goes to the moon' using helium balloons. It's science -\nbut not as you know it.\n\n2) Part 2\nSelf-confessed science geek Greg Foot continues his adrenaline-fuelled odyssey to find answers to\nlife's frequently-asked questions. He discovers whether there's any truth to the urban legend that\nyou could survive in a falling lift if you jump as it hits the ground. He is prepared to sacrifice\nhis friends in an eye-watering expose of what makes chillies hot and, with the help of a human\nsubstitute, he finds out what happens to our bodies when we die. Other secrets shared see Greg\nfire-walking and trying to survive an asteroid attack, while 70s throwback Professor Logic discovers\nthe shortest route around the world.\n\n3) Part 3\nBBC Three's first science series marches on with self-confessed science geek Greg Foot leading the\nway. Greg squares up to champion cage fighter Rosie Sexton and friends to discover if winning unfair\nfights only happens in the movies. He asks perhaps the ultimate science question - why is the sky\nblue? - Before probing the urban legend that your eyeballs fall out if you sneeze with your eyes\nopen. And, as if that was not enough, Greg experiences the highs and lows of surviving on your own\nbodily fluids. Not your average half hour in front of the telly!\n\n4) Part 4\n'In Kill Bill, Uma Thurman was buried alive and escaped. But that was in the movies...' says BBC\nThree's science geek, Greg Foot. You know what's coming next - and you won't be disappointed! As\nwell as being buried, Greg discovers what he needs to become the fastest man on the planet, works\nout why a boomerang comes back and finds out why bulletproof vests are actually bulletproof. And if\nyou've ever wondered whether water drains out of the sink the other way Down Under... watch this space\n\n5) Part 5\nIf a penny falls off the top of the Empire State Building and hits someone on the pavement, will it\nkill them? Science geek and adrenaline junkie Greg Foot lives to risk his neck and get to the bottom\nof such things. Greg comes under sustained attack - he's immersed in cold water to discover what\nextreme temperature can do to you and has his fingers hammered to test a weird painkiller. And then\nhe investigates spontaneous human combustion. Curiouser and curiouser...\n\n6) Part 6\nThe last episode sees self-confessed science geek and adrenaline junkie Greg under pressure as he\nand an inflatable friend attempt to dig to Australia. He will stop at nothing to answer some of\nlife's weirder frequently asked questions and is sucked into quicksand to discover if it is as\ndeadly as the movies make out. He eats a stupefying amount of fast food to see just how quickly you\ncan get fat without really trying and, with the help of a pig, finds out whether it is physically\npossible to die of a broken heart.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/7331/mj0r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/7331/mj0r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/5138/8kfk.jpg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/938/zqug.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/938/zqug.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/6358/kpyr.jpg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/zuxz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/zuxz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1883/kcqz.jpg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/7450/t2s7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/7450/t2s7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4032/zho6.jpg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/9675/p3s9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/9675/p3s9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n* Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7f371618173f334b514e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n* Video Bitrate: 2169 Kbps\n* Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n* Video Resolution: 1280x720\n* Audio Codec: AAC LC\n* Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n* Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n* Run-Time: 29mins\n* Framerate: 25 FPS\n* Number of Parts: 6\n* Container Mp4\n* Part Size: average 442 MB\n* Source: HDTV\n* Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information\n* http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d7mms ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b228c80a14e3b89fd3460587372d791e2df3e584","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Secrets.of.Everything.1of6.HDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b228c80a14e3b89fd3460587372d791e2df3e584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,40,200,10,20,227,184,159,211,70,5,135,55,45,121,30,45,243,229,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
