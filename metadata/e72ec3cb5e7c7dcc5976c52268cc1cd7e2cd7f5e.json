A week later, out bursts Roy, a little purple alien with an odd sense of humor, who has taken up residence in Jim's head. Roy needed a place to stay to adapt to the Earth's environment while on a mission to save the world from a power-hungry alien named Gork. Aiding Jim and Roy are Jim's girlfriend, Madelyn, his personal physician, Dr. Richard Axel, and a group of &quot;human anomalies.&quot; The group consists of Ray, a landscaper who has a lawnmower blade lodged in his skull; Mona, a normal-looking woman with a short tail; Ivan, a Russian who has a mouth in his chest; Raquel, who has an enormous nose and buckteeth; Earl, who has a fishbowl in his mouth; Chin, a long-limbed former-freak show performer from China; and the annoyingly normal head of the group, Shane Blackman. The theme of the story is to reinforce the value of diversity, tolerance, acceptance of differences, and working together to solve problems.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Head\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108799/\n\nCreator: Eric Fogel.\nWriters: Gordon Barnett, David Benullo, Eric Fogel.\nDirectors: Eric Fogel, Ken Kimmelman, Ray Kosarin, Eugene Salandra, Paul Sparagano.\nStarring: Jason Candler, Mike Judge, Gordon Barnett, Patricia Bibby, Tad Hills, Melanie Holtzman, Chris Johnston, Eric Fogel, Maia Danziger, Dick Rodstein.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (verson # 0.8.6f): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01a - The Head Saves The Earth\nS1E01b - The Date\nS1E02a - The Mission\nS1E02b - The First Piece\nS1E03a - The Museum\nS1E03b - Jim's Plan\nS1E04a - The Jungle\nS1E04b - Hillbilly Town\nS1E05a - Rebellion\nS1E05b - Mona's Secret\nS1E06a - Nite Raid\nS1E06b - Rescue\nS1E07 - The Invasion\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - The Rise &amp; Fall of Jim\nS2E02 - Return of the Spider\nS2E03 - The Taste of Romance\nS2E04 - Legend of the Blues\nS2E05 - The Bad Seed\nS2E06 - Rats\n\nExtras...\n\nExtras - VHS Promo (1995)\n''the head'' backcover.jpg\n''the head'' frontcover.jpg\n''the head'' sidecover.jpg\n\n[Episode Guide Included.]\n\n[BLX Note: If you notice at the very end of S1E07, the ripper, Overkill, puts his tag.
