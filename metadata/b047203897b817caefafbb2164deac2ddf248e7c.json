The Triple-length album finds the Juno nominee in true singer/songwriter mode. While he plays most instruments throughout, members of Emergency pop up for special appearances, as do female backing vocals, who add an essential, playful element - especially to the classic-rocking first volume, which focuses on breakups (&quot;Through &amp; Through &amp; Through&quot;, &quot;Every Time You Leave&quot;). The second volume has a more somber, intimate, and acoustic feel - including the folky standout &quot;Shine On, Shine On, Shine On.&quot; It's remarkable that Plaskett keeps things so fresh across the album's 27 tracks; the closing number, &quot;On &amp; On &amp; On,&quot; is an easygoing confessional with high-school references echoing Ashtray Rock's wit. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Plaskett&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Plaskett&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_(Joel_Plaskett_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_(Joel_Plaskett_album)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b047203897b817caefafbb2164deac2ddf248e7c","amp;dn":"Joel+Plaskett+-+Three","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b047203897b817caefafbb2164deac2ddf248e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,71,32,56,151,184,23,202,239,175,187,33,100,222,172,45,223,36,142,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
