Comprised of singer Hayley Mary, guitarist Samuel Lockwood, pianist/keyboardist Heather Shannon, and drummer Nik Kaloper, the group formed in 2007 after meeting at the University of Sydney, though Mary and Lockwood knew each other previously, having both grown up in Byron Bay. Taking a socially aware stance, the band name derived from MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective that Bible character Jezebel was misunderstood or misrepresented. Their first musical offering came in the form of an EP trilogy, beginning with 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s The Man Is Dead and SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Hard, rounded out a year later with Dark Storm. Propelled by a surprising combination of pop hooks and epic, moody energy, The Man Is Dead landed on the CMJ Top 200 chart in summer 2009, the first of many accolades for the band: by 2010, SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Hard helped the band net two Independent Music Awards nods; the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hurt MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was featured as an iTunes Australia song of the week, and Tegan and Sara tapped the quartet to open for them on their spring tour down under. Full-length debut Prisoner arrived digitally the next fall, with Rolling Stone spotlighting the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trycolour.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mom + Pop is slated to issue the physical version of Prisoner in early 2012, just in time for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main stage set at the Coachella music and arts festival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f848b73657a922897cd541e753ec8e26839bddb9","amp;dn":"The+Jezabels+-+The+Brink+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f848b73657a922897cd541e753ec8e26839bddb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,72,183,54,87,169,34,137,124,213,65,231,83,236,142,38,131,155,221,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
