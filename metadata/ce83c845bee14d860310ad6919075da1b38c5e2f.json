They are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music.[1] From 1962, the group consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals) and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals). Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later worked in many genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. The nature of their enormous popularity, which first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, transformed as their songwriting grew in sophistication. They came to be perceived as the embodiment of ideals of the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.\n\nInitially a five-piece line-up of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe (bass) and Pete Best (drums), they built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Sutcliffe left the group in 1961, and Best was replaced by Starr the following year. Moulded into a professional outfit by their manager, Brian Epstein, their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin. They achieved mainstream success in the United Kingdom in late 1962, with their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. Gaining international popularity over the course of the next year, they toured extensively until 1966, then retreated to recording studios until their break-up in 1970. Each then found success in independent musical careers.\n\nDuring their studio years, they produced what critics consider some of their finest material including the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), widely regarded as a masterpiece. They are the best-selling band in the history of popular music,[2][3] and four decades after their break-up, their recordings are still in demand. They have had more number one albums on the UK charts and have held the top spot longer than any other musical act.[4] According to the RIAA, they have sold more albums in the United States than any other artist.[5] The Beatles were placed at number one on Billboard magazine's fiftieth-anniversary list of all-time top Hot 100 artists in 2008.[6] They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences[7] and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.[8] They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.[9] Lennon was murdered outside his home in New York City in 1980, and Harrison died of cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain active. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber Ones 2000\n\n\n1 is a compilation album by The Beatles, released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single released in the United Kingdom and United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on one Compact Disc. 1 was a critical success and has gone on to sell over 31 million copies. In addition, 1 is the seventh best-selling album since May 1991[1] and the best-selling album in the US from 2000 to 2009,[2] and the best selling CD of the decade worldwide with record sales in countries as diverse as the USA and India.\n\nCompiled by producer George Martin and the (then) three surviving members of the band, 1 includes the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the Record Retailer magazine charts and/or the United States on the Billboard magazine charts. It is worth noting, however, that the song &quot;For You Blue&quot; was listed in Billboard chart compilations at #1, as a double A-sided single with &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;,[3] but Capitol Records treated &quot;For You Blue&quot; as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. Meanwhile, &quot;Day Tripper&quot; was included on 1, since it charted at #1 in the UK as a double A side with &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, while in the US, only &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; was #1. The only singles released in both the UK and US that did not reach #1 in either country, and were therefore ineligible for inclusion on the album, were &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½both reached #2 in the UK charts. The former was largely known as &quot;The Beatles' first UK number one single&quot;; however, it reached the top spot in the musical magazines New Musical Express and Melody Maker but not on the chart published by Record Retailer (now Music Week). On the other hand, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was part of a double A-side single along with &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. Being a double A-side, UK sales policies counted the sales as a half of the real amount sold, a fact that kept the single at #2 in the charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck's debut single &quot;Release Me&quot;.\n\nThis album was essentially a combo of both the US and UK versions of the earlier album 20 Greatest Hits, with &quot;Something&quot; added to the mix (that song was left off 20 Greatest Hits because of time constraints). On 1, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was released in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes); on the American version of 20 Greatest Hits it had been released as a shortened version.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\nAll songs by Lennon/McCartney, unless otherwise noted.
