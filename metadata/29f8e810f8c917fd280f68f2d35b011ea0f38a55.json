Stop thinking of employees as either family or as free agents. Think of them instead as allies.\n\nAs a manager you want your employees to help transform the company for the future. And your employees want the company to help transform their careers for the long term. But this win-win scenario will happen only if both sides trust each other enough to commit to mutual investment and mutual benefit. Sadly, trust in the business world is hovering at an all-time low.\n\nWe can rebuild that lost trust with straight talk that recognizes the realities of the modern economy. So, paradoxically, the alliance begins with managers acknowledging that great employees might leave the company, and with employees being honest about their own career aspirations.\n\nBy putting this new alliance at the heart of your talent management strategy, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only bring back trust, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to recruit and retain the entrepreneurial individuals you need to adapt to a fast-changing world.\n\nThese individuals, flexible, creative, and with a bias toward action, thrive when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on a specific Ã¢â‚¬Å“tour of dutyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€when they have a mission thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mutually beneficial to employee and company that can be completed in a realistic period of time.\n\nCoauthored by the founder of LinkedIn, this bold but practical guide for managers and executives will give you the tools you need to recruit, manage, and retain the kind of employees who will make your company thrive in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world of constant innovation and fast-paced change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f8e810f8c917fd280f68f2d35b011ea0f38a55","amp;dn":"The+Alliance%2C+Managing+Talent+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f8e810f8c917fd280f68f2d35b011ea0f38a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,248,232,16,248,201,23,253,40,15,104,242,211,91,1,30,160,243,138,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
