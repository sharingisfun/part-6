Way cool if you're into games that people put a TON of work into.  Must for any adventure/puzzle gamer.  Works fine with the fix on windows 7, don't know about XP or, God forbid, Vista.\n\nInstructions for thickheads:\n\n1. Mount the &quot;Neverhood&quot; image file using a virtual \n\ndrive program like Alcohol 120 or Daemon Tools, or burn \n\nit to a CD and run it off that.\n\n2. Install as usual.\n\n3. Look in the &quot;Neverhood_Win7_Color_Fix&quot; folder.\n\n4. Copy &quot;WAVistaWin7&quot; to the installation folder.\n\n5. Rename the game exe to &quot;WA&quot; (add &quot;.exe&quot; if your \n\ncomputer is set up to display the file extension).\n\n6. Use &quot;WAVistaWin7&quot; to play the game, (compatibility \n\nmode helps).\n\n7. Share this game with people who appreciate art and \n\npuzzle games!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76671e36ffbd92f49d1d1beff62421115162d15a","amp;dn":"Neverhood+CD+Image+%2B+Color+Fix+for+Windows+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76671e36ffbd92f49d1d1beff62421115162d15a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,103,30,54,255,189,146,244,157,29,27,239,246,36,33,17,81,98,209,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
