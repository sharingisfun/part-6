Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty.  His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values.  His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR. \n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                  == FICTION ==\n\n* The Counterfeiters, with Journal of &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; (Vintage, 1973).
