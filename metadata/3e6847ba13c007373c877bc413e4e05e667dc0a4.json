Life on the Edge\r\nThis is the story of an awe-inspiring coastline, 4000 miles long. From the cold, fearsome waters of Cape Horn, where brave rockhopper penguins overcome huge challenges to raise their young, to the far north, with huge elephant seals battling for position in the heat of the desert. Orcas ram-raid the beaches, grabbing seal pups to feed their young. People too gather the sea's bounty, but these shores are not for the faint-hearted.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 24 (~3849Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~144Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 1.68 GB (average)\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6847ba13c007373c877bc413e4e05e667dc0a4","amp;dn":"Patagonia.Earths.Secret.Paradise.3of3.1080p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6847ba13c007373c877bc413e4e05e667dc0a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,104,71,186,19,192,7,55,60,135,123,196,19,228,224,94,102,125,192,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
