Born Evangelos Odyssey Papathanassiou in Volos, Greece, on March 29, 1943, his nascent musical talent was recognized at an early age, but he refused to take piano lessons, instead teaching himself. After high school he formed the early-&amp;#039;60s pop group Formynx, soon the most popular act in Greece. After achieving superstardom at home, Vangelis relocated to Paris in 1968, and was in France at the time of the student riots; unable to go back home, he formed the progressive rock band Aphrodite&amp;#039;s Child with fellow Greek expatriates Demis Roussos and Lucas Sideras, soon scoring a major European hit with the single &quot;Rain and Tears.&quot;\n\nAfter Aphrodite&amp;#039;s Child disbanded in 1972, Vangelis joined French filmmaker Frederic Rossif to compose the scores for the features L&amp;#039;Apocalypse des Animaux and La Fete Sauvage; his proper solo debut, Earth, followed in 1974, around the time he was rumored to be joining Yes. Although Vangelis did rehearse with Yes for a few weeks, he never officially joined their ranks; still, he became close friends with group vocalist Jon Anderson, a frequent collaborator in the years to follow. Relocating to London, Vangelis established his own state-of-the-art recording studio, producing a steady flow of recordings including 1975&amp;#039;s Heaven and Hell, 1976&amp;#039;s Albedo 0.39, 1977&amp;#039;s Spiral, and 1978&amp;#039;s Beaubourg. Teaming with Anderson under the name Jon &amp; Vangelis, he also scored a series of U.K. hits, including 1980&amp;#039;s &quot;I Hear You Now&quot; and the following year&amp;#039;s &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Find My Way Home.&quot;\n\nVangelis&amp;#039; international commercial breakthrough followed in 1982, when his score to Chariots of Fire earned the film one of its many Academy Awards; its theme song even cracked the Top Ten on the U.S. pop charts. That same year, he also created the powerful score to the cult classic Blade Runner, the beginning of a partnership with director Ridley Scott, which also yielded soundtracks to films including 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Vangelis also composed the music for a number of Jacques Cousteau documentaries in addition to maintaining his flourishing solo career, issuing acclaimed LPs including 1985&amp;#039;s The Mask, 1988&amp;#039;s Antarctica, and 1990&amp;#039;s The City. In 1992, he was awarded the Chevalier Order of Arts and Letters, one of France&amp;#039;s most prestigious honors. El Greco followed in 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Pressing Information\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel: EastWest\nCatalog#: 4509-96574-2\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: Europe\nReleased: June 1994\nGenre: Electronic, Jazz, Stage &amp; Screen\nStyle: Score, Ambient\n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\n\nComposed By, Arranged By, Producer, Performer -\nVangelis\n\nEngineer -\nFrederick Rousseau (tracks: 1 to 7, 9 to 12)\nPhilippe Colonna (tracks: 1 to 7, 9 to 12)\nRaine Shine (tracks: 1 to 7, 9 to 12)\nRaphael Preston (tracks: 8)\n\nMastered By -\nFrederick Rousseau* , Mireille Landmann\n\nPhotography [Vangelis Photography] -\nStathis Zalidis\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n&quot;Most of the music contained in this album originates from recordings I made in London in 1982, whilst working on the score for the film Blade Runner. Finding myself unable to release these recordings at the time, it is with great pleasure that I am able to do so now. Some of the pieces contained will be known to you from the Original Soundtrack of the film, whilst others are appearing here for the first time. Looking back to Ridley Scott&amp;#039;s powerful and evocative pictures left me as stimulated as before, and made the recompiling of this music, today, an enjoyable experience.&quot; - Vangelis (Athens, April 1994)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade Runner album review from allmusic.com\n\n\nReview by Zac Johnson\n\nArriving 12 years after the release of the film, Vangelis&amp;#039; soundtrack to the 1982 futuristic noir detective thriller Blade Runner is as bleak and electronically chilling as the film itself. By subtly interspersing clips of dialogue and sounds from the film, Vangelis creates haunting soundscapes with whispered subtexts and sweeping revelations, drawing inspiration from Middle Eastern textures and evoking neo-classical structures. Often cold and forlorn, the listener can almost hear the indifferent winds blowing through the neon and metal cityscapes of Los Angeles in 2019. The sultry, saxophone-driven &quot;Love Theme&quot; has since gone on as one of the composer&amp;#039;s most recognized pieces and stands alone as one of the few warm refuges on an otherwise darkly cold (but beautiful) score. An unfortunate inclusion of the 1930s-inspired ballad &quot;One More Kiss, Dear&quot; interrupts the futuristic synthesized flow of the album with a muted trumpet and Rudy VallÃƒÂ©e-style croon. However well done (and appropriate in the movie), a forlorn love song that sounds as if it is playing on a distant Philco radio in The Waltons&amp;#039; living room jarringly breaks the mood of the album momentarily (although with CD technology, this distraction is easily bypassed). Fans of Ridley Scott&amp;#039;s groundbreaking film (as well as those interested in the evolution of electronic music) will warmly take this recording into their plastic-carbide-alloy hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\nVangelis - Blade Runner (1994)\n\n\n\n01.
