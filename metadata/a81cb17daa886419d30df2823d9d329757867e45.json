But how can she investigate a crime when no one cares about the victim? And how can she stop a killer who has no identity, no motive, and no conscience?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81cb17daa886419d30df2823d9d329757867e45","amp;dn":"FF+Cari+Hunter+-+Cold+to+the+Touch+%5BThe+Dark+Peak+2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81cb17daa886419d30df2823d9d329757867e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,28,177,125,170,136,100,25,211,13,242,130,61,157,50,151,87,134,126,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
