Ovnik's DVD is enlightening and entertaining. The eighty minute DVD is full of helpful information and tips that range from grocery shopping ideas and smart restaurant choices to step-by-step recipes that can be created at home.\n\nOvnik explains, &quot;My goals are to share the changes that I have made with food and get people excited about plant-based foods. Becoming a vegetarian and then a vegan has changed my body inside and out, my mind, my heart, and my soul for the better. And the best part is that I enjoy food now more than ever!&quot;\n\nYou do not have to be a vegan or vegetarian to benefit from the information presented in the &quot;Change Your Food, Change Your Life&quot; DVD. It is full of ideas and suggestions that can benefit anyone - young and old alike. David Gronowski, National Sales Manager for Movie Facts Inc, who recently attended one of Ovnik's seminars, said, &quot;Jill's information has inspired me to make changes in my eating habits. Her style is fun and direct without being preachy!&quot;\n\nJohn McDougall, a medical doctor and founder of the McDougall Program in Santa Rosa, California, states, &quot;A low-fat, plant-based diet is the most powerful medicine you can take to regain lost health and appearance. Jill Ovnik's friendly and practical manner of teaching will help you easily make the long overdue transition to a constructive style of eating.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vegan-gal.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vegan-gal.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***********************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b144dd2a2c4e23f5706b9b1c90f3949037674b13","amp;dn":"Vegan-Gal.com+-+Change+Your+Food%2C+Change+Your+Life%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b144dd2a2c4e23f5706b9b1c90f3949037674b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,68,221,42,44,78,35,245,112,107,155,28,144,243,148,144,55,103,75,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
