Since 2002 when they re-joined the band it has really taken on a life of its own and the sound has developed and grown into what it is today. Since the release of &quot;Part 1&quot; of &quot;House Of Gold &amp; Bones&quot; the band has found a replacement for bassist Shawn Economaki in Johny Chow. Rachel Bolan still handled the bass parts for the album, I'm guessing because Johny Chow hasn't yet had time to learn the songs or Rachel had already tracked the bass parts for the album by the time Johny Chow came aboard. This is the second part of the double concept album &quot;House Of Gold &amp; Bones&quot;, with an accompany comic to be released soon. The album has 12 tracks and clocks in at just over 50 minutes. The accompanying comic series will have the release of the first issue by Dark Horse Comics in just a few short days on April 17th. The first single from the album, &quot;Do Me A Favor&quot; was released on Stone Sour's YouTube channel on February 8th and was released digitally on February 12th. On March\n29th, the track &quot;Gravesend&quot; was premiered on Rolling Stone Magazine's website as the second single from the album.\n\nThe second installment of &quot;House Of Gold &amp; Bones&quot; finds the band stretching their\nmusical muscles a little bit more than on the first part. Josh Rand and Jim Root trade off on some great guitar work, while Corey Taylor provides piano on a few tracks in addition to vocal duties. Roy Mayorga handles drums as well as synthesizers and piano on several tracks. Rachel Bolan from Skid Row filled in on bass again on the album, so the first listen to the new bassist, Johny Chow, will be in live performances. In addition there are guest musicians credited for cello, violin and viola for the track &quot;The Conflagaration&quot;. There are the expected heavier tracks, ranging from hard rock to alt. Metal, but also there are some more &quot;ballad&quot; type tracks, most notably the track &quot;The Conflagaration&quot;. Playing &quot;Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; in succession, you can absolutely hear a large amount of cohesiveness you would expect to hear in a concept album. The guitar solos on the album were masterfully completed, just as you would expect from Jim Root and Josh Rand. Overall I'm finding the first and second installments of this album about equal in my esteem. The biggest difference between the two would be more\nusage of creepy ambient passages in &quot;Part 2&quot; \n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Red city                                             [04:39]\n02.Black john                                           [04:03]\n03.Sadist                                               [05:08]\n04.Peckinpah                                            [04:11]\n05.Stalemate                                            [04:48]\n06.Gravesend                                            [04:41]\n07.'82                                                  [03:42]\n08.The uncanny valley                                   [04:02]\n09.Blue smoke                                           [02:07]\n10.Do me A favor                                        [03:44]\n11.The conflagration                                    [04:56]\n12.The house of gold &amp; bones                            [04:45]\n________\n50:46 min\n 82,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
