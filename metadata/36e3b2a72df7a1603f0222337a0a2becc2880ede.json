This book will teach you how to set up OpenCV for Java and handle matrices using the basic operations of image processing such as filtering and image transforms. It will also help you learn how to use Haar cascades for tracking faces and to detect foreground and background regions with the help of a Kinect device. It will even give you insights into server-side OpenCV. Each chapter is presented with several projects that are ready to use. The functionality of these projects is found in many classes that allow developers to understand computer vision principles and rapidly extend or customize the projects for their needs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e3b2a72df7a1603f0222337a0a2becc2880ede","amp;dn":"OpenCV+3.0+Computer+Vision+with+Java+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e3b2a72df7a1603f0222337a0a2becc2880ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,227,178,167,45,247,161,96,63,2,34,51,122,10,43,236,194,136,14,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
