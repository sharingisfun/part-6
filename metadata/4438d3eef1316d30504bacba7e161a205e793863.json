He has been a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and was its chief fiction editor for many years.  Angell has received a number of awards for his writing, including the George Polk Award for Commentary in 1980, the Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement in 2005, and the inaugural PEN/ESPN Lifetime Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing in 2011.  He was named the 2014 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on December 10, 2013.\n\nThere is no finer writer on baseball than Roger Angell.  His explorations of the summer game are built on acute observation and joyful participation, conveyed in a prose style as admired as Ted Williams's swing, and abundant with humor and virtuosity.  &quot;Angell makes baseball sound like an art form,&quot; Herbert Mitgang wrote in the New York Times; &quot;he demonstrates that writing about it is an art form, too.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ROGER ANGELL (Penguin, 1978).\n\n* FIVE SEASONS: A Baseball Companion (Popular Library, 1978).\n\n* GAME TIME: A Baseball Companion (Harcourt, 2003).
