In contrast to the conventional belief that living matter is passive in the face of threats to its existence, the book explores the theory that the Earth's living matter - air, ocean, and land surfaces - forms a complex system which has the capacity to keep Earth a place fit for life.\n\nSince GAIA was first published, many of James Lovelock's predictions have come true and his theory has become a hotly argued topic in scientific circles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8e2e7ea299078c8bfef1d481c3b999427538a3","amp;dn":"The+Revenge+of+Gaia+-+James+Lovelock.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8e2e7ea299078c8bfef1d481c3b999427538a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,142,46,126,162,153,7,140,139,254,241,212,129,195,185,153,66,117,56,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
