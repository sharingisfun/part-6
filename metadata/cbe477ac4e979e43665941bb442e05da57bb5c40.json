It spent four weeks as number one on Billboard magazine's Pop Albums chart, and was subsequently certified platinum. The album spawned three singles, &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot; and the title track, which peaked at #1, #28 and #60 on Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 chart, respectively.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;:\n\n&quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; is a song made popular by American singer-songwriter Kim Carnes. The song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon. DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement. But it was not until 1981, when Carnes recorded her version of the song, that it became a commercial success. The Kim Carnes recording of the song spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (interrupted for one week by the &quot;Stars on 45 Medley&quot;), and over eight million copies of the album on which the song appeared, Mistaken Identity, were sold. The single went on to become the highest seller of the year and won the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The song was also a number one hit in 31 countries, including Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Japan, and Brazil, but it achieved more moderate success in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number ten. The music video was directed by Russell Mulcahy. According to producer Val Garay, the original demo of the tune that was brought to him sounded like &quot;a Leon Russell track, with this beer-barrel polka piano part.&quot; Keyboardist Bill Cuomo came up with the signature synth riff which now defines Carnes' version. The song was recorded completely live in the studio on the first take. Bette Davis herself admitted to being a fan of the song and approached Carnes and the songwriters to thank them for making her &quot;a part of modern times.&quot; The song was ranked at number 12 on Billboard's list of the top 100 songs in the first 50 years of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.&quot;\n\nAllmusic review 'Mistaken Identity':\n\n&quot;Mistaken Identity should have established Kim Carnes as a huge international star. Her Rod Stewart rasp, affiliation with Kenny Rogers, management by Ken Kragen when he was arguably at his peak, makes one wonder why the across-the-board success of &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; couldn't be duplicated. Three years after the success of this album, Tina Turner actually did conquer the world, the various producers on Private Dancer weaving enough different textures to make for a multi-dimensional masterpiece. Too many cooks made for wonderful stew. Val Garay certainly did a good job on Mistaken Identity, more defined than his work with Marty Balin on the Lucky album a year after this, an album which, for that great artist, wasn't very...lucky. It's not that the other Donna Weiss/Jackie DeShannon tune, &quot;Hit and Run,&quot; which follows &quot;Bette Davis Eyes,&quot; doesn't have a good performance; it does. The problem with the Mistaken Identity album is that everything on it stands in the shadows of a masterpiece. The country risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of the Jackie DeShannon original from New Arrangement has as extraordinary a re-working as Lou Reed's &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; got from Bob Ezrin when Mitch Ryder got to make it his underground anthem. Carnes is just brilliant on her solo composition, &quot;Mistaken Identity, and it is subtle and smart enough to have crossed over to adult contemporary and jazz formats. Frankie Miller's &quot;When I'm Away From You&quot; sounds like Rod Stewart doing &quot;True Blue&quot; -- those upfront snare drums and a hook as strong as an undertow. Perhaps this should have been the follow-up to &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; rather than &quot;Draw of the Cards,&quot; which followed and lingered around the Top 30. Not a place to be for the follow-up to a monster smash. This is an evolution from her work on A&amp;M, and certainly far removed from the New Christy Minstrels. The album comes with photographs galore on the innersleeve, all the lyrics, and tons of credits. Her first hit on EMI about ten months earlier was the fantastic reworking of &quot;More Love,&quot; and that elegant pop gem was the type of thing needed to propel this to the status Private Dancer attained for Turner, that Physical garnered for Olivia Newton-John. &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot; plays like a mellow dance number, aimed at a new wave audience when -- well, face it, her biggest smash before &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; was the mellow &quot;Don't Fall in Love With a Dreamer.&quot; There is absolutely no pun intended to say this album is more of an identity crisis than a mistaken identity. Wendy Waldman, Carnes, and her husband, Dave Ellingson, craft &quot;Break the Rules Tonite (Out of School),&quot; but it is just too much of a diversion on an album that tests the waters of different rock genres. Flirting with Leslie West-style hard rock is not as appealing to her audience as the beautifully crafted Tom Snow/Dean Pitchford tune &quot;Don't Call It Love.&quot; Her other solo composition, &quot;Miss You Tonite,&quot; is more the style we expect, and Carnes' beautiful piano work on Richard Stekol's &quot;My Old Pals&quot; brings the album to a proper conclusion. If only this big and talented team could have come up with another couple of brilliant new arrangements as they did with &quot;Bette Davis Eyes.&quot; The name Kim should be up there with Olivia, Tina and Grace, and it wasn't for lack of talent that superstardom didn't occur. ~ Joe Viglione.&quot;\n\nAllmusic review 'The Mistaken Identity Collection':\n&quot;Kim Carnes formed her style on the folk-rock circuit, where a dulcet, technical pop voice is not required. Her husky, full voice signifies early '80s radio and is still unforgettable. The Mistaken Identity Collection starts with her 1981 single &quot;Bette Davis Eyes.&quot; This song initiated a string of hits that kept her on the world's charts through 1986. Included here is a duet with Kenny Rogers, another gravel-voiced legend. This is a sparse, piano-introduced ballad from Rogers' 1980 Gideon, a concept album on a modern cowboy. Basically, this collection is an album reissue with a number of bonus tracks. The Mistaken Identity (1981) album contributes the first ten tracks of bouncy synth-pop, such as its title track and &quot;Don't Call It Love.&quot; Other songs, like the acoustic guitar-led &quot;When I'm Away From You,&quot; the hard rock &quot;Break the Rules Tonite (Out of School),&quot; and the piano and mandolin lament &quot;My Old Pals&quot; expose different facets of this pop talent. Kim Carnes drew on resources of country and folk to bring grace and individuality to the '80s charts. ~ Tom Schulte.&quot;\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n===========\n01. &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; (Donna Weiss, Jackie DeShannon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 \n\n02. &quot;Hit and Run&quot; (Donna Weiss, Jackie DeShannon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17 \n\n03. &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; (Kim Carnes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 \n\n04. &quot;When I'm Away from You&quot; (Frankie Miller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n \n05. &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot; (Dave Ellingson, Bill Cuomo, Val Garay) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n \n06. &quot;Break the Rules Tonite (Out of School)&quot; (Carnes, Ellingson, Waldman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n \n07. &quot;Still Hold On&quot; (Kim Carnes, Eric Kaz, Dave Ellingson, Wendy Waldman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n \n08. &quot;Don't Call It Love&quot; (Tom Snow, Dean Pitchford) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n \n09. &quot;Miss You Tonight&quot; (Kim Carnes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n \n10. &quot;My Old Pals&quot; (Richard Stekol) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19 \n\n+\n\n11. &quot;You're A Part of Me&quot;   (Kim Carnes)  - 3:44\n* Duet with Gene Cotton.
