There were only 27 minutes of music on the original Quiet Nights LP, and six minutes were taken up by a quintet performance of &quot;Summer Night.&quot; The six remaining tracks are enjoyable enough (highlighted by &quot;Once Upon a Summertime&quot; and &quot;Corcovado&quot;), but rather brief, making one wonder why Evans could not have been persuaded to write more material. The 1997 CD reissue adds &quot;The Time of the Barracudas&quot; (which clocks in at almost 13 minutes), and was not released until the 1996 Complete Miles Davis/Gil Evans box set. The latter is an interesting but not too substantial mini-suite written for a stage play that features the late 1963 Miles Davis Quintet joined by four brass, three woodwinds, and a harp. Overall, this CD has its moments of interest, but it has an incomplete feel and is not too essential.
