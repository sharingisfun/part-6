Her stick-in-the mud boyfriend won't commit and she gets passed over for a promotion at the store where she works. She decides to make a Christmas list. After it's deposited in Santa's mailbox at the store, she starts getting everything she wanted, but it doesn't always turn out as she expected.\n\nThis movie was aired yearly on Thanksgiving weekend from 1997 through 2009. It's in 4:3 as it was broadcast..  I happened to record it the last time it aired. As of yet, no DVD has been released of this movie. I hope at least one person looking for this will find it here.
