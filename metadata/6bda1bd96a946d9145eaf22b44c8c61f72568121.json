(Emmanuel Todd Marianne)\n\nThe book of the season. (Telerama)\n\nOutstandingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ A political and theoretical bulldozer. (Mediapart)\n\nAn explosive argument. (Liberation)\n\nIn this magisterial work, Thomas Piketty has performed a great service to the academy and to the public. He has written a pioneering book that is at once thoughtful, measured, and provocative. The force of his case rests not on a diatribe or a political agenda, but on carefully collected and analyzed data and reasoned thought. The book should have a major impact on our discussions of contemporary inequality and its meaning for our democratic institutions and ideals. I can only marvel at PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discipline and rigor in researching and writing it. (Rakesh Khurana, Harvard Business School)\n\nThis book is not only the definitive account of the historical evolution of inequality in advanced economies, it is also a magisterial treatise on capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inherent dynamics. Piketty ends his book with a ringing call for the global taxation of capital. Whether or not you agree with him on the solution, this book presents a stark challenge for those who would like to save capitalism from itself. (Dani Rodrik, Institute for Advanced Study)\n\nAnyone remotely interested in economics needs to read Thomas PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capital in the 21st Century. (Matthew Yglesias Slate 2014-02-10)\n\nThe book aims to revolutionize the way people think about the economic history of the past two centuries. It may well manage the featÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It is, first and foremost, a very detailed look at 200 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of data on the distribution of income and wealth across the rich world (with some figures for large emerging markets also included). This mountain of data allows Piketty to tell a simple and compelling storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The database on which the book is built is formidable, and it is difficult to dispute his call for a new perspective on the modern economic era, whether or not one agrees with his policy recommendationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ We are all used to sneering at communism because of its manifest failure to deliver the sustained rates of growth managed by market economies. But MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original critique of capitalism was not that it made for lousy growth rates. It was that a rising concentration of wealth couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be sustained politically. Ultimately, those of us who would like to preserve the market system need to grapple with that sort of dynamic, in the context of the worrying numbers on inequality that Piketty presents. (The Economist 2014-01-09)\n\nPiketty, a prominent economist, explains the tendency in mature societies for wealth to concentrate in a few hands. (Amy Merrick New Yorker 2014-02-06)\n\nDefies left and right orthodoxy by arguing that worsening inequality is an inevitable outcome of free market capitalismÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[It] suggests that traditional liberal government policies on spending, taxation and regulation will fail to diminish inequalityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Without what [Piketty] acknowledges is a politically unrealistic global wealth tax, he sees the United States and the developed world on a path toward a degree of inequality that will reach levels likely to cause severe social disruption. Final judgment on PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work will come with time--a problem in and of itself, because if he is right, inequality will worsen, making it all the more difficult to take preemptive action. (Thomas B. Edsall New York Times 2014-01-28)\n\nIt is a great work, a fearsome beast of analysis stuffed with an awesome amount of empirical data, and will surely be a landmark study in economics. (The Week 2014-02-20)\n\nGroundbreakingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The usefulness of economics is determined by the quality of data at our disposal. PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new volume offers a fresh perspective and a wealth of newly compiled data that will go a long way in helping us understand how capitalism actually works. (Christopher Matthews Fortune.com 2014-02-26)\n\nA sweeping account of rising inequalityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Eventually, Piketty says, we could see the reemergence of a world familiar to nineteenth-century Europeans; he cites the novels of Austen and Balzac. In this Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpatrimonial society,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a small group of wealthy rentiers lives lavishly on the fruits of its inherited wealth, and the rest struggle to keep upÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The proper role of public intellectuals is to question accepted dogmas, conceive of new methods of analysis, and expand the terms of public debate. Capital in the Twenty-first Century does all these thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Piketty has written a book that nobody interested in a defining issue of our era can afford to ignore. (John Cassidy New Yorker 2014-03-31)\n\nIt seems safe to say that Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the magnum opus of the French economist Thomas Piketty, will be the most important economics book of the year--and maybe of the decade. Piketty, arguably the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading expert on income and wealth inequality, does more than document the growing concentration of income in the hands of a small economic elite. He also makes a powerful case that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on the way back to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpatrimonial capitalism,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ in which the commanding heights of the economy are dominated not just by wealth, but also by inherited wealth, in which birth matters more than effort and talent. (Paul Krugman New York Times 2014-03-23)\n\nA landmark bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦which brings a ton of data to bear in reaching the commonsensical conclusion that inequality has to do with more than just blind market forces at work. (George Packer New Yorker blog 2014-03-25)\n\nBracingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Piketty provides a fresh and sweeping analysis of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic history that puts into question many of our core beliefs about the organization of market economies. His most startling news is that the belief that inequality will eventually stabilize and subside on its own, a long-held tenet of free market capitalism, is wrong. Rather, the economic forces concentrating more and more wealth into the hands of the fortunate few are almost sure to prevail for a very long time. (Eduardo Porter New York Times 2014-03-11)\n\nPikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book is an important contribution to understanding what we need to do to produce more growth, wider economic opportunity and greater social stability. (David Cay Johnston Al Jazeera America 2014-03-23)\n\nThe blockbuster economics book of the season, Thomas PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues that the great equalizing decades following World War II, which brought on the rise of the middle class in the United States, were but a historical anomaly. Armed with centuries of data, Piketty says the rich are going to continue to gobble up a greater share of income, and our current system will do nothing to reverse that trend. (Shaila Dewan New York Times Magazine 2014-03-30)\n\nRarely does a book come alongÃ¢â‚¬Â¦that completely alters the paradigm through which we frame our worldview. Thomas PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magisterial study of the structure of capitalism since the 18th century, Capital in the 21st Century, is such a bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦As leaders from Pope Francis to Barack Obama have proclaimed, growing inequality is the defining issue of our time. Much indeterminate discussion has swirled around its key causes, from job-displacing technologies to wage-deflating outsourcing of jobs. Capital in the 21st Century clears up all the confused thinking and presents us with the most compelling analysis to date of the key dynamic that drives ever-increasing inequality. This book is more than a must read. It is a manual for action that provides a fresh framework for the new politics of the 21st Century. (Nathan Gardels The WorldPost 2014-03-24)\n\n[PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] thesis is simple. The growing concentration of capital in fewer hands has enabled its owners to keep it relatively scarce and thus valuableÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Continuing high inequality is socially and economically destabilizing, though it need not lead to MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apocalypse. So what we need is another bout of social democracy especially in the form of progressive taxation. You many think that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require 600 pages to get this message across. This would be wrong. The strength of PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is his close attention to the different sources of inequality, the massive documentation underpinning his history and conclusions, and his impressive culls from sociology and literature, which exhibit the richness of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpolitical economyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ compared to its thin mathematical successor that has attained such prominenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is a timely intervention in the current debate about inequality and its causes. (Robert Skidelsky Prospect 2014-04-01)\n\nOver the last decade or so, economist Thomas Piketty has made his name central to serious discussions of inequalityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Piketty expands upon his empirical work of the last 10 years, while also setting forth a political theory of inequality. This last element of the book gives special attention to tax policy and makes some provocative suggestions--new and higher taxes on the very rich. (Joseph Thorndike Forbes 2014-03-26)\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a brilliant, surprisingly readable work that synthesizes a staggering amount of careful research to make the case that income inequality is no accident. Indeed, Piketty argues that it is a feature of capitalism itself--unless governments take action to rein in capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excessesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦But the value of PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is that it shows that capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s postwar heyday--in which incomes at the bottom and the top actually converged--was a historical anomaly. PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s analysis of the last two centuries makes the case that capital in its natural state does not tend to spread out or trickle down, but to concentrate in the hands of a fewÃ¢â‚¬Â¦He has starkly and convincingly outlined the stakes for future generations. Either weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a new birth of reformed capitalismÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have wealth concentration on such a colossal scale that it will threaten the democratic order. (Ryan Cooper The Week 2014-03-25)\n\nThomas PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book, Capital in the 21st Century, painstakingly details the dynamics of wealth and income inequality throughout the last two centuries, and offers a somewhat grim picture of the future of economic inequality. Along the way, Piketty also offers his theory of the cause of exploding executive pay and how we can successfully combat this destructive trend. (Matt Bruenig The Week 2014-03-20)\n\nIn Capital in the Twenty-first Century, Piketty sums up his research, tracing the history and pattern of economic inequality across a number of countries from the eighteenth century to the present, analyzing its causes, and evaluating some policy fixes. Spanning nearly 700 densely packed pages, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big book in more than one sense of the word. Clearly written, ambitious in scope, rooted in economics but drawing on insights from related fields like history and sociology, PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capital resembles nothing so much as an old-fashioned work of political economy by the likes of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, or John Maynard Keynes. But what is particularly exciting about this book is that, due to advances in technology, Piketty is able to draw on data that not only spans a substantially longer historical time frame, but is also necessarily more complete and consistent than the records earlier theorists were forced to rely on. As a result, his analysis is significantly more comprehensive than those of his predecessors--and easily as persuasiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Capital is a consistently engrossing read, encompassing topics including the stunning comeback that inherited wealth has made in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced economies, the dubiousness of the economic theory that a workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wage is equal to his or her marginal productivity, the moral insidiousness of meritocratic justifications of inequality, and more. But the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major strength lies in PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to see the big picture. His original and rigorously well-documented insights into the deep structures of capitalism show us how the dynamics of capital accumulation have played out historically over the past three centuries, and how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely to develop in the century to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty-first-century inequality crisis is, if anything, even more daunting and complex than the one we experienced a century ago. But as Piketty reminds us, the solutions to this problem are political, and they lie within our grasp. Should Americans choose to deploy those solutions, not only would we be doing the right thing, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be living up to our deepest traditions and most cherished ideals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kathleen Geier Washington Monthly 2014-03-01)\n\nThe most eagerly anticipated book on economics in many years. (Toby Sanger Globe and Mail 2014-03-11)\n\nThough an heir to TocquevilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tradition of analytic history, Thomas Piketty has a message that could not be more different: Unless we act, inequality will grow much worse, eventually making a mockery of our democratic institutions. With wealth more and more concentrated, countries racing to cut taxes on capital, and inheritance coming to rival entrepreneurship as a source of riches, a new patrimonial elite may prove as inevitable as Tocqueville once believed democratic equality was. This forecast is based not on speculation but on facts assembled through prodigious researchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Private wealth has reached new highs relative to national income and is approaching levels of concentration not seen since before 1929Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Piketty is rightly pessimistic about an immediate response. The influence of the wealthy on democratic politics and on how we think about merit and reward presents formidable obstaclesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Perhaps with this magisterial book, the troubling realities Piketty unearths will become more visible and the rationalizations of the privileged that sustain them less dominant. Like Tocqueville, Piketty has given us a new image of ourselves. This time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one we should resist, not welcome. (Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson American Prospect 2014-03-01)\n\nCapital in the Twenty-First Century is written in the tradition of great economic textsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Piketty and his colleagues have spent recent years putting together a World Top Incomes Database, their detailed investigation into income in countries around the globe, spanning several decadesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Informed by this historical, cross-country data, Piketty evaluates--and rejects--a number of generally accepted conclusions in economic thought, while being careful to note the limitations of inevitably Ã¢â‚¬Å“imperfect and incompleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sources. The main finding of his investigation is that capital still mattersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦This book is significant for its findings, as well as for how Piketty arrives at them. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy--and fun--to argue about ideas. It is much more difficult to argue about facts. Facts are what Piketty gives us, while pressing the reader to engage in the journey of sorting through their implications. (Heather Boushey American Prospect 2014-03-01)\n\nThomas PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capital in the Twenty-First Century is a monumental book that will influence economic analysis (and perhaps policymaking) in the years to come. In the way it is written and the importance of the questions it asks, it is a book the classic authors of economics could have written if they lived today and had access to the vast empirical material Piketty and his colleagues collectedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦In a short review, it is impossible to do even partial justice to the wealth of information, data, analysis, and discussion contained in this book of almost 700 pages. Piketty has returned economics to the classical roots where it seeks to understand the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlaws of motionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of capitalism. He has re-emphasized the distinction between Ã¢â‚¬ËœunearnedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœearnedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ income that had been tucked away for so long under misleading terminologies of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhuman capital,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Ëœeconomic agents,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfactors of production.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Labor and capitalÃ¢â‚¬â€those who have to work for a living and those who live from property--people in flesh--are squarely back in economics via this great book. (Branko Milanovic American Prospect 2014-03-01)\n\n[An] enormously important book. (Doug Henwood Bookforum 2014-04-01)\n\nHow does a rigorous, seven-hundred page economic history become a lionized hit? Through the canny voice of professor Thomas Piketty, and his demystification of inherited wealth, Karl MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true legacy, and what we mean when we talk about monetary Ã¢â‚¬ËœgrowthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœinequality.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ (Barnes and Noble Review 2014-03-26)\nAbout the Author\nThomas Piketty is Professor at the Paris School of Economics.
