It is written on three separate levels, by Scott Adams, better known as the creator of the Dilbert comic. What is less known about Adams is that he's a trained hypnotist. God's Debris is what happens when creativity and hypnosis intersect. On the surface, God's Debris is a simple fictional story of a delivery man who encounters an Avatar who knows literally everything.\n\nThis is another of the books I've put effort into chapterizing and tagging properly. It's one of the harder to find ones I've got, so I figured others might like it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b67f1614467a73282ae4c80f881ee243cfb0d8","amp;dn":"God%27s+Debris+-+Scott+Adams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b67f1614467a73282ae4c80f881ee243cfb0d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,182,127,22,20,70,122,115,40,42,228,200,15,136,30,226,67,207,176,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
