Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label. But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in New York City. BEGIN AGAIN is produced and financed by Exclusive Media and produced by Anthony Bregman, Tobin Armbrust and Judd Apatow.\n\nDirector: John Carney\n\nWriters: John Carney\n\nActors: Keira Knightley, Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, Hailee Steinfeld, James Corden, Ceelo Green, Catherine Keener\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 44 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a7c858af9752f9cad2c855da1dfa99dae13d74b","amp;dn":"Begin+Again.+Keira+Knightley+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a7c858af9752f9cad2c855da1dfa99dae13d74b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,124,133,138,249,117,47,156,173,44,133,93,161,223,169,157,174,19,215,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
