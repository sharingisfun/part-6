They are distinguished scientists and their careers are in ruins. Both scientists choose to look at the phenomenon of genetic engineering. Both made important discoveries. Both of them are suffering the fate of those who criticise the powerful vested interests that now dominate big business and scientific research.\n\nStatements made by scientists themselves prove that 95% of the research in the area of genetic engineering is paid by the industry. Only 5% of the research is independent. The big danger for freedom of science and our democracy is evident. Can the public Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ still trust our scientists?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1522270/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1522270/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c568ccf8312bf851f453bb7e8810763dd8444c9","amp;dn":"Scientists+Under+Attack+%282009%29+FULL+Documentary+GMO%28360p_H.264-A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c568ccf8312bf851f453bb7e8810763dd8444c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,86,140,207,131,18,191,133,31,69,59,183,232,129,7,99,221,132,68,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
