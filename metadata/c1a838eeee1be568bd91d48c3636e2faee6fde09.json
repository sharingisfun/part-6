With the Brinsleys, Lowe began a back-to-basics movement that flowered into punk rock in the late '70s. As the house producer for Stiff, he recorded many seminal records by the likes of the Damned, Elvis Costello, and the Pretenders. His rough, ragged production style earned him the nickname &quot;Basher&quot; and also established the amateurish, D.I.Y. aesthetics of punk. Despite his massive influence on punk rock, Lowe never really was a punk rocker. Lowe was concerned with bringing back the tradition of three-minute pop singles and hard-driving rock &amp; roll, but he subverted his melodic songcraft with a nasty sense of humor. His early solo singles and albums Jesus of Cool and Labour of Lust overflowed with hooks, bizarre jokes, and an infectious energy that made them some of the most acclaimed pop records of the new wave era. As new wave began to fade away in the early '80s, Lowe began to explore roots rock, eventually becoming a full-fledged country-rocker in the '90s. While he never had another hit after 1980's &quot;Cruel to Be Kind,&quot; his records found a devoted cult audience and were often critically praised.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.So It Goes\n02.Heart Of The City\n03.(I Love The Sound Of) Breaking Glass\n04.Little Hitler\n05.No Reason\n06.36 Inches High\n07.Marie Provost\n08.American Squirm\n09.Cracking Up\n10.Big Kick, Plain Scrap\n11.Born Fighter\n12.Switchboard Susan\n13.Without Love\n14.Cruel To Be Kind\n15.When I Write The Book\n16.Heart\n17.Raging Eyes\n18.Time Wounds All Heels\n19.Maureen\n20.Half A Boy &amp; Half A Man\n21.7 Nights To Rock\n22.She Don't Love Nobody\n23.The Rose Of England\n24.I Knew The Bride (When She Used To Rock 'N' Roll)\n25.Lovers Jamboree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a838eeee1be568bd91d48c3636e2faee6fde09","amp;dn":"Nick+Lowe+-+Basher%3A+The+Best+Of+Nick+Lowe+%281989%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a838eeee1be568bd91d48c3636e2faee6fde09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,168,56,238,238,27,229,104,189,145,212,140,54,54,226,250,238,111,222,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
