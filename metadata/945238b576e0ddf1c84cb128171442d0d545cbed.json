By the early 1970s, he had dropped the &quot;System&quot; from his recordings, and he continued to strive for broader success with other various bands. In 1973, he put together The Silver Bullet Band, an evolving group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the album Night Moves. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums.\nA roots rocker with a classic raspy, shouting voice, Seger wrote and recorded songs that dealt with love, women, blue-collar themes and was an exemplar of heartland rock. Seger has recorded many hits, including &quot;Night Moves&quot;, &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, &quot;We've Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Like a Rock&quot;, and also co-wrote the Eagles' number-one hit &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;. His iconic recording of &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001.\nWith a career spanning five decades, Seger continues to perform and record today. Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nAlbums:\n\nRamblin' Gamblin' Man (1969)\nNoah (1969)\nMongrel (1970)\nBrand New Morning (1971)\nSmokin' O.P.'s (1972)\nBack in '72 (1973)\nSeven (1974)\nBeautiful Loser (1975)\nNight Moves (1976)\nStranger in Town (1978)\nAgainst the Wind (1980)\nThe Distance (1982)\nLike a Rock (1986)\nThe Fire Inside (1991)\nIt's a Mystery (1995)\nFace the Promise (2006)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945238b576e0ddf1c84cb128171442d0d545cbed","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+and+The+Silver+Bullet+Band+-+Studio+Discography+320kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945238b576e0ddf1c84cb128171442d0d545cbed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,82,56,181,118,224,221,241,200,76,177,40,23,20,66,208,213,69,203,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
