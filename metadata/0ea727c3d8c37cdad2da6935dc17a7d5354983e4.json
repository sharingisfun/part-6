This is definitely a must-have utility if you own a scanner or a digital camera, use digital images whether at work, or at home. This program allows you to convert images to JPEG format using the most powerful JPEG compression engine, shrink the large file size of your graphic files, optimize pictures for quickly loading from the Web, e-mail smaller image files faster and not exceeding email size limitations, resize images and make thumbnails. Advanced JPEG Compressor can acquire pictures from your scanner or digital camera, and save them in the JPG format with the highest quality / file size ratio. You can easily scan, compress and e-mail photos from Advanced JPEG Compressor. This program works as dedicated JPEG converter, allowing you to open existing images in many formats (BMP, TIFF, GIF, PNG, ...), and a JPEG optimizer, compressing existing JPG images. The possibility to create, edit and apply named compression profiles considerably helps in processing various types of graphic files. The Batch Processing function makes it easy to process multiple images applying the selected compression profile. Graphic Detail Quality Equalizer is a unique feature of the program that gives you significant flexibility in adjusting the compressed image quality. Compression-oriented image prefiltering helps to achieve better compression/optimization results and improve the visual appearance of an image. Separate compression sliders for Luma(intensity) and Chroma(color) channels allow you to gain better compression results, eliminate color artefacts, and significantly improve the compressed image quality. Hold the defined compression ratio is a unique feature for graphic software that allows you to create images whose file size is limited by the defined compression ratio (like the &quot;bit rate&quot; parameter for audio files), and does not depend on their content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea727c3d8c37cdad2da6935dc17a7d5354983e4","amp;dn":"Advanced+JPEG+Compressor+v4.8+%2B+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea727c3d8c37cdad2da6935dc17a7d5354983e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,167,39,195,216,195,124,218,210,218,105,53,220,23,167,213,53,73,131,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
