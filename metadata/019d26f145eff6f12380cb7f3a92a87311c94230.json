Sarah takes on Beth's identity and occupation as a police detective after Beth's death. During the first season, Sarah discovers that she is a clone, that she has many 'sister' clones spread throughout North America and Europe, and that someone is plotting to kill them and her. Alongside her foster brother, Felix Dawkins, and two of her fellow clones, Alison Hendrix and Cosima Niehaus, Sarah discovers the origin of the clones: a scientific movement called Neolution. The movement believes that human beings can use scientific knowledge to direct their evolution as a species. The movement has an institutional base in the large, influential, and wealthy biotech corporation, the Dyad Institute. The Dyad Institute conducts basic research, lobbies political institutions, and promotes its eugenics program, aided by the clone Rachel Duncan. But it also seeks to profit from the technology the clones embody. It has thus placed &quot;monitors&quot; into the clones' personal lives, allegedly to study them scientifically but also to keep them under surveillance.\n\nSarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) es una mujer que asume la identidad de su clon, Elizabeth Childs, despuÃƒÂ©s de presenciar el suicidio de la propia Elizabeth en las vÃƒÂ­as del tren. La serie plantea cuestiones sobre las implicaciones morales y ÃƒÂ©ticas de la clonaciÃƒÂ³n humana y lo que esto supone en cuanto a la identidad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019d26f145eff6f12380cb7f3a92a87311c94230","amp;dn":"Orphan.Black.S03E09.REPACK.HDTV.Subtitulado.Esp.SC.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019d26f145eff6f12380cb7f3a92a87311c94230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,157,38,241,69,239,246,241,35,128,203,127,58,146,168,115,17,201,66,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
