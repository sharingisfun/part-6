Si puÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² comunque inquadrare il loro stile nell'innovativo progressive rock. \nELO parte II sono stati un gruppo musicale formato da ex componenti della  Electric Light Orchestra e voluta dal batterista Bev Bevan . . \nAttualmente sono  conosciuti come The Orchestra. \n\n[ENG]\nElectric Light Orchestra, often abbreviated ELO, were a Birmingham-based English Rock music group formed by the final lineup of The Move (Roy Wood, Bev Bevan and Jeff Lynne) during 1970, who went on to release twelve studio albums and more than four dozen singles in total under the leadership of Lynne. The band was initially formed to accommodate Wood and Lynne's desire to expand artistically by creating modern Rock and Pop music infused with strong Classical overtones.\nDespite early singles' success in the UK the band were initially more successful in the United States, billed as &quot;The English guys with the big fiddles&quot;. They soon gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in their native United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest selling bands. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 Top 40 hit singles in both the UK and the US. The group also scored 20 Top 20 U.K. hit singles, as well as 19 Top 20 hit singles in the U.S. Billboard charts. The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits of any band in US chart history without ever having a number one single.\nELO collected a minimum of 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA and 38 BPI awards, and sold well over 50 million albums worldwide during the group's active period of recording and touring.\n\nMore Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra\n\nMp3
