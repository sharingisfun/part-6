Now in its second edition, it continues to offer clear and practical guidelines for the management of victims of major trauma, reflecting current practice in the United Kingdom and Europe.\n\nThe second edition benefits from an increase in illustrative material, and is further enhanced by the addition of at least one case study for every topic in the book. 'Objectives' and 'Summary' boxes ensure a user-friendly approach, and are supplemented by key points, highlighted throughout the text. New to the second edition are 'Global Perspectives' boxes at the end of most of the chapters, which highlight techniques and practices from around the world.\n\nWritten by members of Trauma Care and invited experts, the Trauma Care Manual offers a nationally accepted set of standards for good practice which provide a benchmark for all those involved in the care of the trauma patient. It is a unique reference for all professionals involved in the care of victims of trauma and an invaluable addition to every Accident and Emergency Department","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d79c17a7d3a29300c3e5e6e13e48b70ca2e134","amp;dn":"Trauma+Care+Manual%2C+2E-+Greaves+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d79c17a7d3a29300c3e5e6e13e48b70ca2e134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,215,156,23,167,211,162,147,0,195,229,230,225,62,72,183,12,162,225,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
