(Picasso is credited with having that honor in the first half of the 20th Century.)\n\nLaurie Anderson narrates the movie.\n\nIn one segment, Burns compares Warhol\\&amp;#039;s portraits of such celebrities as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor with the icons of saints that Warhol saw in his boyhood Byzantine Catholic parish, where he spent many hours as a child.\n\nBurns follows Warhol through his meteoric rise in New York\\&amp;#039;s commercial art world during the 1950s. Burns cites 1962, the year Warhol first exhibited his soup can paintings in Los Angeles, as the turning point in Warhol\\&amp;#039;s career.\n\nBurns also describes in detail Valerie Solanas\\&amp;#039; near-fatal shooting of Warhol in 1968.\n\nAndy Warhol: A Documentary Film debuted in early September 2006 with a two-week theatrical run in New York City at Film Forum that charged no admission. The movie was televised in the United States over two nights, September 20-21, 2006, on PBS as part of its American Masters series.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f56611f23ee32b295b0a1a490dd29bae8f7eee12","amp;dn":"Andy+Warhol%3A+A+Documentary+Film+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f56611f23ee32b295b0a1a490dd29bae8f7eee12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,102,17,242,62,227,43,41,91,10,26,73,13,210,155,174,143,126,238,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
