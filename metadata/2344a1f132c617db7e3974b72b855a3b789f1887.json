In a Jewish accent, Brooks would ad lib answers to topics such as the earliest known language (\\&quot;basic Rock\\&quot;), the creation of the Cross (\\&quot;it was easier to put together than the Star of David, and Joan of Arc (\\&quot;Know her? I went with her, dummy, I went with her!\\&quot;). \n\nThe inspiration for the skit was a tape-recorded exchange between Brooks and Reiner at a party. The tape recorder was brought into the mix shortly after the opening salvos, as the two comics soon had the party audience in stitches. In 1961, when the duo began doing the skit on television, Brooks had just undergone surgery for gout. Because of his post-surgical discomfort, Brooks quipped, \\&quot;I feel like a 2000-year-old man,\\&quot; which led Reiner to begin questioning him about what it\\'s like to be a 2000-year-old man and to describe history as Brooks saw it.\n\nDisc 1\n1.  2000 Year Old Man \t\n2.
