We also use the wrong words - sometimes unknowingly - and get ourselves into situations we'd rather not be in.\n\nAs Stephen R. Covey points out in his introduction:\n\n- Words sell and words repel\n- Words lead and words impede\n- Words heal and words kill\n\nKevin hall discovered the deeper power inherent in words after a fateful encounter with a wise shopkeeper in Vienna. When that led to an introduction to an esteemed etymologist residing in a senior home, hall embarked on a project that changed his life, and has since changed the lives of thousands of readers. Discover the eleven words - as well as the secret word - that when used correctly, can light your path to the lifelong success you deserve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d0a6322b8b9caa09f02c92b8c4d13c89be3b9e0","amp;dn":"Aspire+%28Kevin+Hall%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d0a6322b8b9caa09f02c92b8c4d13c89be3b9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,10,99,34,184,185,202,160,159,2,201,43,140,77,19,200,155,227,185,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
