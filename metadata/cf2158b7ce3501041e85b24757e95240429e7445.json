It is a practical reference source incorporating the most current information on recent developments, management issues and operative procedures. The text is thoroughly referenced and supported by evidence-based recommendations wherever possible, distinguishing between strong evidence to support a conclusion, and evidence suggesting that a recommendation can be reached on the balance of probabilities.\n\nThis is a title in the Companion to Specialist Surgical Practice series whose eight volumes are an established and highly regarded source of information for the specialist general surgeon.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Companion to Specialist Surgical Practice series provides a current and concise summary of the key topics within each major surgical sub-specialty.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Each volume highlights evidence-based practice both in the text and within the extensive list of references at the end of every chapter.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An expanded authorship team across the series includes additional European and World experts with an increased emphasis on global practice.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The contents of the series have been extensively revised in line with recently published evidence.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Modern techniques in transplantation and new forms of immunosuppression are emphasised throughout this volume.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The substantial interest in new organ perfusion and in the preservation techniques in organ donation and transplantation are reflected in a new chapter written by an international expert.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ All the chapters reflect transplant care as a multi-disciplinary team of clinicians working in a collaborative fashion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2158b7ce3501041e85b24757e95240429e7445","amp;dn":"Core+Topics+in+General+%26amp%3B+Emergency+Surgery%2C+5E+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf2158b7ce3501041e85b24757e95240429e7445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,33,88,183,206,53,1,4,30,133,178,71,87,233,82,64,66,158,116,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
