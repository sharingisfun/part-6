The second area, the Residential District, contains the city's prison, a trailer park with an Elvis-themed bar dubbed &quot;Disgracelands&quot;, a shopping mall, and a giant hydroelectric power plant. The third and final area is the Industrial District; it holds a large seaport, a meat packing plant, a Nuclear Power Plant and a Krishna temple.\nThere are a total of seven criminal gangs in the game: the Zaibatsu, a corrupt corporation, is present in all three areas. The Downtown area is also home to the Loonies, a gang of mentally ill people who have taken over the city asylum, and the Yakuza. In the Residential area, the gangs include SRS Scientists and the Rednecks, who live in a trailer park and drive around in pickups with large Confederate flags. The Industrial area contains the Russian Mafia and the Hare Krishna. Each gang has their own special characteristics, car, and behavior.\nThe game can be played in two modes (only in the PC version), noon or dusk. On the noon setting the lighting is bright making the game clear to see (also lowering the graphics overhead on low-end hardware because of the fewer lighting effects). On the dusk setting the game is darker, with multiple dynamic lights from explosions and car headlights. The Dreamcast version of the game can only be played in the dusk setting. The PlayStation version of the game can only be played in the noon setting. This feature was expanded further in Grand Theft Auto III where the daylight changes with the time of day in the game.\n[edit]Gameplay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166fa9179b429a1270efb68fb29c23e4dba1cca8","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+2+%28GTA2%29+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166fa9179b429a1270efb68fb29c23e4dba1cca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,111,169,23,155,66,154,18,112,239,182,143,178,156,35,228,219,161,204,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
