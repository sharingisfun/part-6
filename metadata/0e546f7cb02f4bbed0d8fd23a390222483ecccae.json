As is the case with most Baker albums, Somewhere Over the Rainbow feels like a quickly put-together session recording. The material is all standard jazz repertoire, played in a no-frills format, without specific arrangements or endings. It is the musicianship here that is the main attraction. Baker has rarely sounded better; his technique is in top shape, and his solos are textbook examples of lyrical bop playing. Baker, as was not always the case throughout his career, surrounds himself on Somewhere Over the Rainbow with strong and supportive sidemen. Guitarist Rene Thomas, underrecorded throughout his career, becomes one of the highlights of the session, and makes the album a must-have for bop guitar enthusiasts. Tune selection is surprisingly upbeat for a Baker recording.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Well You Needn't 6:21\n2 These Foolish Things 4:55\n3 Star Eyes 6:59\n4 Somewhere Over The Rainbow 3:27\n5 Pent-up House 6:51\n6 Blues In The Closet 7:43\n\nCredits\n\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Benoit Quersin\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daniel Humair\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RenÃƒÂ© Thomas\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Amedeo Tommasi\nTenor Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bobby Jaspar\nTrumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chet Baker\n\nNotes\n\nRecorded at RCA Studios, Roma, Italy, January 5, 1962.
