Bush. This book reveals that far from being a campus fraternity, the society is more concerned with the success of its members in the post-collegiate world. Included are a verified membership list, rare reprints of original Order materials revealing the interlocking power centres dominated by Bonesmen, and a peek inside the Tomb, their 140-year-old private clubhouse.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sutton used a combination of public-domain information on Skull and Bones (such as Yale yearbooks) and previously unreleased documents sent to him by Charlotte Iserbyt, whose father was a Skull and Bones member,[6] to speculate that it had played an important role in coordinating the political and economic relationships underlying the historical events he (Sutton) wrote of in his previous works. He published his speculations as America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones Ã¢â‚¬â€ which, according to Sutton, was his most important work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4fae34ba46d2f5a4d3ea6ced6aaf657e2f0efe6","amp;dn":"Antony+Cyril+Sutton+-+1983+-+America%27s+Secret+Establishment+-+An","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4fae34ba46d2f5a4d3ea6ced6aaf657e2f0efe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,250,227,75,164,109,47,90,77,62,166,206,214,170,246,87,226,240,239,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
