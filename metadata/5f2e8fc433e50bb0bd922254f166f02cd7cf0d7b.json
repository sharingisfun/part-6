Offered as is.\n\n\nOne Day at a Time is an American situation comedy on the CBS network that aired from December 16, 1975, until May 28, 1984. It starred Bonnie Franklin as Ann Romano, a divorced mother who moves to Indianapolis with her two teenage daughters Julie and Barbara Cooper (Mackenzie Phillips, Valerie Bertinelli) with Dwayne Schneider as their building superintendent (Pat Harrington).\n\nThe show was created by Whitney Blake and Allan Manings, a husband-and-wife writing duo who were both actors in the 1950s and 1960s. The show was based on Whitney Blake's own life as a single mother, raising her child, future actress Meredith Baxter.[2] The show was developed by Norman Lear and was produced by T.A.T. Communications Company (1975ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´1982), Allwhit, Inc., and later Embassy Television (1982ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´1984).\n\nLike many shows developed by Lear, One Day at a Time was more of a comedy-drama, using its half-hour to tackle serious issues in life and relationships, particularly those related to second wave feminism. The earlier seasons in particular featured several multi-part episodes, serious topics, and dramatic moments. As in other Lear shows of the era, the show was shot on videotape in front of a live audience, giving it a sense of immediacy, and close-ups were often employed during dramatic scenes. As the social climate changed in the 1980s, the show's writing became less edgy, and as the girls became adults, the innovation of the original premise ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ a divorced mother raising teenage children ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ was lost. The show's nine years give it the second-longest tenure of any Lear-developed sitcom under its original name, after The Jeffersons. (All in the Family and its continuation series Archie Bunker's Place had a combined 13-year run, but only eight of those years were under the show's original name.)\n\nFranklin's character, Ann Romano, is often incorrectly cited as network television's first female divorcee as a regular series character (Vivian Vance's character on The Lucy Show in the early 1960s had been divorced).\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2e8fc433e50bb0bd922254f166f02cd7cf0d7b","amp;dn":"One+Day+At+A+Time+-+Season+1+%28Bonnie+Franklin%2C+Valerie+Bertinell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2e8fc433e50bb0bd922254f166f02cd7cf0d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,46,143,196,51,229,11,176,189,146,34,84,241,102,240,44,215,207,13,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
