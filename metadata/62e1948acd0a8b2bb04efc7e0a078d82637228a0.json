The band consists of lead vocalist Jeremy Bolm, guitarists Clayton Stevens and Nick Steinhardt, with Tyler Kirby on bass guitar and drummer Elliot Babin. They have released three studio albums and several EPs. They released ...To the Beat of a Dead Horse in 2009 and their second album Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me was released in 2011. On September 24, 2013, their third full length, Is Survived By, was released.\nTouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© are noted for their honest and confessional lyrics, for fusing influences from Converge, Raein, La Quiete and Pg.99 and for being a part of screamo revival. The band has also been credited as being a part of a self-proclaimed group of post-hardcore bands called &quot;The Wave&quot;, with fellow post-hardcore bands Defeater, La Dispute, Make Do and Mend and Pianos Become the Teeth.[7] But Bolm considers The Wave as less specific and also includes bands Tigers Jaw, Title Fight, Balance And Composure, Former Thieves and Into It. Over It.\n\n\nReview:\nAfter a bracing EP and two genre-revitalizing LPs, nothing was the same for Los Angeles post-hardcore band TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© going into Is Survived By. Lead singer Jeremy BolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a lot on his mind-- HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerned about what his third album will mean for his legacy as an artist and whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focused too much on what he does rather than who he is. He sees the replication of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shortcomings in his current relationships, but realizes his old man did the best he could. Fake friends are forgiven and then quickly forgotten as Bolm starts to like who heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s becoming. Or, in short, TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© started from the bottom and the whole teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ here on the superlative Is Survived By, including Balance &amp; ComposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jon Simmons, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra and revered indie producer Brad Wood.\nGranted, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unlikely that Is Survived By will divert the attention of Drake listeners this week even if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d find plenty of thematic similarities. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not impossible and TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© appear keenly aware that Is Survived By has them poised to reach beyond a fanbase that can be described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“hardcoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ one way or the other. For the most part, Bolm is trying to maintain some sort of grace while kinda freaking out about the situation-- Ã¢â‚¬Å“you can call this coming clean or a repeat of what you know/ about the struggles I once had as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m learning to let goÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, goes the frantic introduction of Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Write Content.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He tips his hand with the mere title of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Social CaterpillarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and assures the listener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry I still get dizzy in the usual situations.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sure, he was still pulling hours at a Burbank record shop this year, but as the frontman for an intensely loved and meaningful punk band, he gets put in a lot of unusual situations for the typical guy.\nFor example, the one he encounters on opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just ExistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, where someone inquires how heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Ã¢â‚¬Å“like to be rememberedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the sort of question typically asked of, say, Drake. His answer becomes the sole joke on an album of almost superhuman sobriety-- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I simply smiled and said Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather stay forever.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ By the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, he figures out the trick is in the title (Ã¢â‚¬Å“youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never know much of the truth/so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just existÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and as insular as BolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerns may be, TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© veer towards accessibility in all aspects on Is Survived By.\nBolm still maintains the same jagged wail that got TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© (not wrongfully) tagged as Ã¢â‚¬Å“screamoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the outset-- all grit and serration, no affectation-- and the band provides plenty of max-chaos-per-second supercolliders in the form of Ã¢â‚¬Å“DNAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue Angel&quot;. Only this time, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed in the context of these funny things called Ã¢â‚¬Å“songs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Some of them run up to three whole minutes and beyond, some are slow and even pretty in a twinkly emo kind of way (Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Write ContentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Non FictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), some are love songs and all of them are produced with clarity and precision by a guy whose big credits are for Liz Phair, Smashing Pumpkins and Sunny Day Real Estate records that are older than a lot of the kids I see at TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© shows. \nIs Survived By is about 50% longer than any other TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© album and the quintet wisely instruct the listener how to pace themselves. The near a cappella Ã¢â‚¬Å“Praise/LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and near post-rock instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“Non FictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would be remarkable for introducing variety alone; in the scheme of Is Survived By, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re plot devices, introducing lyrical and musical motifs repeated immediately thereafter in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anyone/AnythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Steps&quot;. These tracks jolt the listener right back with choruses that go outside the scope of Ã¢â‚¬Å“melodic hardcoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a bruised and spittle-flecked pop-punk that comes awfully close to radio-friendly, even if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never hear it at Warped Tour.\nIn essence, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an excellent band continuing to be excellent with more people paying attention. They havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lost sight of what got them here, however the band downplays their own virtuosity by emphasizing a studied recklessness, cranking out one anthemic riff after another, providing a familiar melodic framework that just skirts total recall. They serve as a setting for a frontman who barks out words that take the shape of narratives and conversations rather than poetry. In particular, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HarborÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Write ContentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are story-songs as well as cerebral exercises based upon the multiple (mis)readings of their titles. On the latter, Bolm meets Hull for the first time through mutual friends in New York and communes over a common concern shared by an LA punk band and a southern, grungy emo act-- can your personal happiness be an artistic liability?\nThere is a lot of Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Is Survived By, but it focuses on the social utility of the self, that a content person is more likely to make a positive difference. On the closing title track, Bolm implores the listener to Ã¢â‚¬Å“write a song that everyone can sing along to/ so when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gone, you can live on/they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to meet that statement with cynicism: surely, our society would be better off if fewer people believed they were a special little snowflake with a song that needs to be heard, right? But if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© live, you should, in part because it provides the proper visual-- the raw-throated, stone-faced man you hear on Is Survived By is liable to appear cleancut, constantly smiling even and he knows his band would be nothing without you. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is Survived ByÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pretty much an audio thank you note. The physicality of Is Survived By is more like a bear hug than an ass-kicking, wherein the passion can be scary at first, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disarming, done out of love. They take this stuff seriously because this, right here, matters. You matter. And within these songs is the struggle in realizing that self-esteem comes more from estimable acts than outside validation. Is Survived By should receive plenty praise anyway, but TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ© lead by example.\nReview By Ian Cohen \nRate: 8.0/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01. Just Exist (2:18)\n02.
