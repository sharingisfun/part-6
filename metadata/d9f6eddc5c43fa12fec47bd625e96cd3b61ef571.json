The band reached a peak of popularity in the late 1970s, with the release of seven albums blending elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&amp;B, and pop.[1] Rolling Stone magazine has called them &quot;the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies.&quot;[2]\n\nThe band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played by Becker and Fagen along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians.[1] Steely Dan's &quot;cerebral,&quot; &quot;wry&quot; and &quot;eccentric&quot;[1] lyrics are filled with sharp sarcasm which often touches upon such &quot;dark&quot; themes as drugs,[3][4][5][6] crime,[6] and their true-to-life &quot;contempt of west coast hippies.&quot;[5][6] The pair are well-known for their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio,[7][8] with one notable example being that Becker and Fagen used at least 42 different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that resulted in 1980's Gaucho ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an album that contains only seven songs.[9]\n\nSteely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974, but in 1975 became a purely studio-based act. The late 1970s saw the group release a series of extremely successful singles and albums. They disbanded in 1981, and throughout most of the next decade, Fagen and Becker remained largely inactive in the music world. During this time, the group steadily built and maintained &quot;a cult following.&quot;[1] In 1993, the group resumed playing live concerts; the early 21st century saw Steely Dan release two albums of new material, the first of which earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best of Steely Dan 2007 (20th Century Masters) \n\n\n\n\n20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: The Best of Steely Dan , released by Universal Music as part of their 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection series, is a CD that collects a variety of early material by Steely Dan.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Do It Again&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Reelin' in the Years&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Only a Fool Would Say That&quot; \n4.\t&quot;My Old School&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Rikki Don't Lose That Number&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Any World (That I'm Welcome To)&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Deacon Blues&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Josie&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Time out of Mind&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Third World Man&quot; \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f6eddc5c43fa12fec47bd625e96cd3b61ef571","amp;dn":"Steely+Dan+-+Best+of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2007+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9f6eddc5c43fa12fec47bd625e96cd3b61ef571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,246,237,220,92,67,250,18,254,196,123,214,37,233,108,211,182,30,245,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
