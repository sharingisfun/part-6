As far as I know, season 2 DVDs were released only in Poland, Czech and Russia. I've managed to get Polish DVDs with English and Polish audio written on the box but actually there is English, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish and Russian dubbing. What a good kind of trolling!\nThe DVDs are even worse then the first season ones. A lot of aliasing and encoding artifacts here and there. This is probably the production issue and it explains why didn't they release it in the rest of Europe.\nFrench audio was taken from DTVRip and has some fragments missing. Most of them are fixed with TVRip patches but was too lazy to find them all.\n\nI'm quite impressed that even 10 years after airing this series is not forgotten, the communities are alive and very active, and people actually care. Wow, just wow.\n\nIf you have any information of DVDs or missing audiotracks, feel free to contact me via email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0e676f634e786f626a67657d7d20617c69207c7b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nHope you'll like it.\nValdikSS, 2015.\n\n### Season 2 Episode 1-26\n\n**Video**: H.264 720Ãƒâ€”576 25 FPS + 50 FPS Ending (only in episodes with vertical scrolling in ending) (DAR 4:3, 768Ãƒâ€”576) CRF 18  \n**Audio**: [AC3 192Kb/s] English, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Russian, [MP3 192Kb/s] French, Italian  \n**Subtitles**: [Vobsub] Russian, Ukrainian, [Signs only] Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfae96c1804713f04e47f88b2dab9519834f86e","amp;dn":"W.I.T.C.H.+WITCH+Season+2+Multilingual+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfae96c1804713f04e47f88b2dab9519834f86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,250,233,108,24,4,113,63,4,228,127,136,178,218,185,81,152,52,248,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
