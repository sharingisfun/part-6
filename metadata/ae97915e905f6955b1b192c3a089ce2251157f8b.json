No serial is needed to install or to play and you can tell the installer to shutdown the computer automatically when the installation is finished.\n\n- The game is updated with patch 1.21 (main menu shows v1.1.1.6156) and cracked, both 32 and 64-bit. Yeah, not only 32-bit files are included, but also 64-bit ones to run the game the smoothest way possible. Even more, you can play using the original (non-cracked) files with a mini-image. Everything indluded.\n\n- Multiplayer works in both LAN or official servers (though in the latter case you need a valid key).\n\n- Voice and text are in English and Spanish. The installer will give you the chance to install one or both (and, in this second case, let you choose later using a cmd menu).\n\n- A trainer, a fantastic pdf guide and the libraries the game requires are also included.\n\n- Nothing has been deleted. The game is full.\n\n\n\n============================================\nInstructions:                              =\n============================================\n\n1. Install.\n2. Play.\n\n\n\n============================================\nFAQ:                                       =\n============================================\n\nQ: My game does not work.\nA: Try installing or updating DirectX and Visual C++ libraries.\n\nQ: Does the multiplayer work in this release?\nA: Yes, both LAN and official servers, although the latter case needs an original game key.\n\nQ: I own the game. Can I use my serial number for multiplayer in this release?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can I use mods in this release?\nA: Yes. In fact, a mod for &quot;extreme resolution&quot; is included.\n\nQ: Do I need Steam to play?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does this release include the 64-bit files updated to 1.21 version?\nA: Yes, and ready to play.\n\nQ: Do I need to change the properties of the 64-bit cracked .exe to run it in compatibility mode for Vista sp2 and as administrator?\nA: No, because the installer does this already for you.\n\n\n\nNotice this is not an update but the full game. Do not install it over an existing installation.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae97915e905f6955b1b192c3a089ce2251157f8b","amp;dn":"Crysis+v1.21+32%2F64-bit+%28repack%29+%28English%2FSpanish%29+%2AFINAL%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae97915e905f6955b1b192c3a089ce2251157f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,151,145,94,144,95,105,85,177,177,146,195,160,137,206,34,81,21,127,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
