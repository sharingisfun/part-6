This part was made for him (in fact, he's given top writing credit), and under his steely exterior you can tell he's having a ball delivering those rapid-fire recitations of regulations and deadpan expressions of moral outrage. Tom Hanks plays Pep Streebek, the laissez-faire narco agent who is Friday's new partner. Their assignment: bust the Pagans, a wild-and-woolly gang of dope fiends, deadbeats, and beatniks behind a bewildering array of bizarre robberies. Friday and Streebek outfox a corrupt televangelist (Christopher Plummer), bicker over chili dogs and cigarettes, alternately revile and fawn over a porn millionaire (Dabney Coleman), wrestle a 30-foot-long anaconda, and rescue the virgin Connie Swail (the only girl capable of stealing Friday's heart).\n\n  Starring: Dan Aykroyd, Tom Hanks, Christopher Plummer, Harry Morgan, Dabney Coleman, Alexandra Paul.\n\n  Directed by: Tom Mankiewicz.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 46min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd35b6898a5fe8a162afceadf7be901b180a6b83","amp;dn":"Dragnet+%281987%29+%28Dan+Aykroyd%2C+Tom+Hanks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd35b6898a5fe8a162afceadf7be901b180a6b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,53,182,137,138,95,232,161,98,175,206,173,247,190,144,27,24,10,107,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
