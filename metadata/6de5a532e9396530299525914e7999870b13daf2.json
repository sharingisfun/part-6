The work treats of the history and culture of  India from the early civilization of the Indus Valley to the coming of the Muslims, and is more comprehensive than any other single-volume work of its kind hitherto published in English, covering all aspects of ancient Indian life and thought both in the Aryan North and the Dravidian South. It is primarily intended for the reader with no background knowledge of the subject, and the author has tried, as far as possible, to leave nothing unexplained, but classified bibliographies are provided for those who wish to proceed further, and appendices deal briefly with some of the more recondite aspects of ancient Indian culture.\n\nThe work contains over 200 illustrations, many hitherto unpublished, in halftone and color, together with line-illustrations and maps. It includes chapters on Prehistory, Pohtical History, Political Life and Thought, the Social Order, Everyday Life, Religion and Philosophy, the Arts, and Language and Literature, and contains many original translations from the classical languages of India","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de5a532e9396530299525914e7999870b13daf2","amp;dn":"The+wonder+that+was+India+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de5a532e9396530299525914e7999870b13daf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,229,165,50,233,57,101,48,41,149,37,145,78,121,153,135,11,19,218,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
