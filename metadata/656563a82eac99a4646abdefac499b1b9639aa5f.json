From hundreds of entries, just 32 have made it onto the shortlist for the Shed of the Year 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Unique and Historic \r\nGeorge Clarke begins his annual quest by turning his attentions to those sheds in the Unique and Historic categories. These include a shed that rotates 360 degrees to follow the sun and another that can hit the road, clocking in at speeds up to 90mph. Also on display are a faithful replica of an Anglo Saxon longhouse and a Vietnam War bunker in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\n2)  Eco and Unexpected \r\nShed of the Year continues as he and his fellow judges turn their attention to the Eco and Unexpected categories. Eco includes a mud hut in Norfolk and a shed on wheels, while featuring in the new unexpected category is a shed located on a flood plain designed to rise up with whatever water levels surround it. There is also an allegedly haunted shed, so viewers might wish to make sure they are not alone before tuning in.\r\n\r\n3)  Pubs and Entertainment \r\nThe 2016 competition arrives at its half-way point, with the turn of the most popular category - Pubs and Entertainment sheds. This fiercely contested group includes an entire Wild West town built out of sheds up in Aberdeen, a faithful replica of a Polish mountain drinking den in rural Ireland, and a nightclub in a Hackney with a truly one-of-a-kind owner. Meanwhile, among the shortlisted sheds in the Workshops and Studios group are a blacksmith's smithy and Star Wars shed. Presenter George Clarke also meets a man with over 300 lawnmowers.\r\n\r\n4)  Winning Shed 2016 \r\nThe 2016 competition continues, with the Budget category, which includes a colourful beach house made for just Â£20 and a shed that actually earned its owner Â£100 in profit. The Cabins and Summerhouses group features a classic van and a dream structure in an allotment. Next, presenter George Clarke and his fellow judges are tasked to choose one shed from all the category winners across the series to crown as the overall winner.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-3-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~3331 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.09 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/cy7fsn/amazing-spaces-shed-of-the-year-episode-guide\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Amazing%20Spaces%3A%20Shed%20of%20the%20Year%20Series%201 \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Amazing%20Spaces%3A%20Shed%20of%20the%20Year%20Series%202","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656563a82eac99a4646abdefac499b1b9639aa5f","amp;dn":"Amazs+Shed+Of+The+Year+Series+3+3of4+Pubs+and+Entertain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656563a82eac99a4646abdefac499b1b9639aa5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,101,99,168,46,172,153,164,100,106,189,239,172,73,155,27,150,57,170,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
