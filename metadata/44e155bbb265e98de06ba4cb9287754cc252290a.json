Melancholy at times but always soothing, Hiatus takes us on a journey, falling in love, breaking up and moving on. It's bitter sweet in places but always finds a bit of humour and manages to raise your eyes up to the sky. This reviewer had to turn the lights off and listen in the dark - something which hasn't happened for a long time. Like getting hugged by a sunset. If you've been missing Lemonjelly and dZihan and Kamien then this is for you.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Save Yourself\n02 Nobody\n03 Gentle Flame\n04 Tombs\n05 Nightingale Force Winds\n06 Turbine\n07 Sightless\n08 This Means Something\n09 Ghost Notes\n10 Insurrection\n11 Black Dogs\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e155bbb265e98de06ba4cb9287754cc252290a","amp;dn":"Hiatus+-+Ghost+Notes+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e155bbb265e98de06ba4cb9287754cc252290a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,225,85,187,178,101,233,141,224,107,164,203,146,135,117,76,194,82,41,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
