From there, we'll bring\r\nthe mesh into RealFlow where we'll use the Magic daemon\r\nwith the Dyverso solver to animate a fluid simulation that\r\nforms our logo\r\n\r\nAfter finishing our particle simulation in RealFlow, we'll\r\nbring it back into Maya for rendering before bringing\r\neverything into After Effects for final compositing and\r\nanimation. We'll also look at creating a simple jingle for\r\nour bumper in Audition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f91db0f0390bbfa038c14230693c9fb8442c733","amp;dn":"DIGITALTUTORS+USING+DYVERSO+FOR+MOTION+GRAPHICS+IN+REALFLOW+AND+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f91db0f0390bbfa038c14230693c9fb8442c733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,145,219,15,3,144,187,250,3,140,20,35,6,147,201,251,132,66,199,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
