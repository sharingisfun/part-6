I Think Ur A Contra\n\nI bought this because i like horchata,especially on a hot summers day.\n\n\nVW's second, Contra, is as gem-like as its predecessor, if arguably less \n\nimmediate. It finds inventive new ways to do the same thing as before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the \n\nclassic task of a second album. There are fewer guitars and a far richer \n\nsoundbed. The African sources are still audible, but this time, Congolese \n\nthumb pianos, redolent of Konono No 1, crop up on &quot;Horchata&quot;. New \n\nappropriations include Puerto Rican reggaeton, Jamaican dancehall, and \n\nCalifornian ska-punk.\n\nMost rock bands can't avoid comparisons with the Clash when they drop ska \n\nor reggae into their sound, as VW do on &quot;Diplomat's Son&quot;, a funny little skank \n\nthat comes curlicued with violins. The sweet, sad closer, &quot;I Think Ur a \n\nContra&quot;, contains another Clash allusion, when singer-songwriter Ezra Koenig \n\nrhymes &quot;rock'n'roll&quot; with &quot;complete control&quot; (a Clash song).\n\nThe Clash named their fourth album Sandinista, after the Nicaraguan \n\nleft-wingers; you can only assume Contra is some sort of perverse reference to \n\nVW's favourite band rather than any support for the right-wing death squads \n\ncovertly funded by the CIA.\n\nThe Clash references, though revealing, are fleeting; Vampire Weekend \n\ncertainly haven't turned into rebel rockers. Geopolitics features in passing on \n\nContra; Koenig is too evolved a lyricist for anything else. &quot;Holiday&quot; notes the \n\ntension of recent times obliquely. &quot;A vegetarian since the invasion/ She'd \n\nnever seen the word 'bombs' blown up to 96 point Futura,&quot; he sings.\n\nRather, each impeccably crafted nugget here is an experiment in rhythm that \n\ngrabs inventively from both high culture and low. &quot;California English&quot; boasts \n\ndisorienting Auto-Tuned vocals and more violins. Moreover, Koenig no \n\nlonger seems to be quipping his lyrics, but crooning in falsetto on an album \n\nwhose joyousness is tinged with wistfulness and regret. Contra, then, \n\nconfounds and delights once again, with new heart offsetting Vampire \n\nWeekend's not inconsiderable brains.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/25/vampire-weekend-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/25/vampire-weekend-2/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6361fc97b73bab3e209e37f8ad9ce586d98da3","amp;dn":"Vampire+Weekend...Contra%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6361fc97b73bab3e209e37f8ad9ce586d98da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,99,97,252,151,183,59,171,62,32,158,55,248,173,156,229,134,217,141,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
