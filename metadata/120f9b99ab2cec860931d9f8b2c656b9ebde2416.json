Years ago at his orders, the Lokhars nuked the Earth and sprayed it with a bio-terminator.\n\nCreed has begun raiding alien worlds for more starships and the tech needed to clean the radioactive Earth. But how can his handful of cruisers stop the approaching armada?\n\nIf Creed hopes to save humanity, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to unlock the secrets of the Forerunner artifact he brought back from hyperspace. Then, in a race against time, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to risk everything on a desperate raid into the heart of the alien empire.\n\nRead by Christian Rummel\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 48 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:120f9b99ab2cec860931d9f8b2c656b9ebde2416","amp;dn":"Vaughn+Heppner+-+Star+Viking+%28Extinction+Wars+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"120f9b99ab2cec860931d9f8b2c656b9ebde2416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,15,155,153,171,44,236,134,9,49,217,248,178,198,86,185,235,222,36,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
