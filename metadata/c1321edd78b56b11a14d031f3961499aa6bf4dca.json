The great pioneering scientists of the Renaissance and the early Enlightenment (including Copernicus, Galileo, and Sir Isaac Newton) were fervent devotees of the philosophical/mystical system of Hermeticism. Many of the most important scientists of this age, including Galileo, belonged to a secret society called the Giordanisti, which had the agenda to overthrow the Church and establish a new age of Hermetic supremacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1321edd78b56b11a14d031f3961499aa6bf4dca","amp;dn":"The+Forbidden+Universe%3A+The+Occult+Origins+of+Science+%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1321edd78b56b11a14d031f3961499aa6bf4dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,50,30,221,120,181,107,17,161,77,3,31,57,97,73,154,166,191,77,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
