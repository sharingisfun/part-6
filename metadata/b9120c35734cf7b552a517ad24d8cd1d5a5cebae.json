The band is currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Ed Robertson, and Tyler Stewart. Barenaked Ladies formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, then a suburban municipality outside the City of Toronto.[1] They are best known for their hit singles, &quot;One Week&quot;, &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;, &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;;[1] as well as the theme for the sitcom The Big Bang Theory. They even did a theme song for the 2000 children's program Seven Little Monsters. They have won multiple Juno Awards and have been nominated for Grammy Awards. They are also known for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. Their live shows are known for humorous banter between songs and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.[2] Original keyboardist Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995, and founding member Steven Page departed in 2009. They have sold over 15 million records including albums and singles. \n\n\n\nHits From Yesterday &amp; The Day Before 2011\n\nHits from Yesterday &amp; the Day Before is a greatest hits compilation album by Barenaked Ladies which includes most of the band's US singles released from 1997 to 2010.
