We answered that question using a mock-up by our friend AlphaDog and adding some more stuff like patch cables and polyphony, and it turned out to be a very different beast indeed. While ABL Pro has it's roots in sequenced synth sounds it also excels at pads and leads and is something of a hidden gem for many producers. We guarantee you nothing else sounds quite like ABL Pro.\n\nAudioRealism Bass Line 2 (ABL2)\n\nThe legendary silver box which is hallmark in electronic music has been recreated in AudioRealism Bass Line 2 (ABL2). Analog modeling techniques have been employed to create a DSP-algorithm that accurately emulates every aspect of the original TB-303, from growling basses to hollow middles and beeping highs with metal rattling accents. Patterns are composed in a fashion similar to the original using the integrated step sequencer with easy to use manipulation functions such as transpose and randomization\n\nAudioRealism Drum Machine (ADM)\n\nBooming bassdrums, saucy cymbals and crispy snares can be used to describe the sound of drum machines from the early 80's. ADM contains three classic vintage drum machines from that era rolled into one, combined with a 32-step internal sequencer and pattern controlled fx (PCF). Get all your patterns into ADM via the Import Rebirth function or directly from your old 909 via sysex (we will provide a free tool for dumping sysex).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.ph - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (10).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a90c906e5d08e58bb1b3d75187726960f3ea338","amp;dn":"AudioRealism+Plugins+Pack+2014.10.05+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a90c906e5d08e58bb1b3d75187726960f3ea338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,144,201,6,229,208,142,88,187,27,61,117,24,119,38,150,15,62,163,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
