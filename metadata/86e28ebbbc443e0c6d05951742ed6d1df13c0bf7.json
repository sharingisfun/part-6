Worse yet, heâ€™s relegated to his grandfatherâ€™s old house and rambling scrapyard. To complicate things, the women in his life are pulling from every direction. But Itâ€™s through a bizarre turn of events that Jason is led to a dried up subterranean aquifer hundreds of feet below ground. Here he discovers an advanced alien spacecraft, one that will propel his life in a new direction.\r\n\r\nThe adventure beginsâ€¦ and with it new troubles for Jason: The Craing, an unstoppable interstellar threat, is headed right for Earth. A desperate situation goes from bad to worse as the Alliance crumbles.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Jasonâ€™s unorthodox and impetuous nature seems to work in his favor as he moves up to the captainâ€™s chair. First order of business is to reconnect with his SEAL team compatriots and face this enemy head on. What's at stake? The very survival of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n05 - Craing Dominion\r\n06 - The Great Space\r\n07 - Call to Battle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by L.J.
