A Roman prostitute has been brutally murdered in a park near the Tiber River and in order to forward their investigation, the police corner a handful of people who were in the park at the time. As they separately tell their versions of why they were there and what they did, their narrations do not necessarily match the images on the screen that do reflect the truth. By the time all the flashbacks have been completed, a real picture of the crime emerges, revealing that one of those in custody is the killer.\n\nFile Name .........................................: La commare secca.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,465,194,496 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:33:13\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x384 (AR: 1.667)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1894 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.321 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055858/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055858/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Italian\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese\n\nMy rip of the Criterion DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375d240e9b27046a05d0f5f6f8de42875a540e31","amp;dn":"La+commare+secca+%28Bernardo+Bertolucci%2C+1962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375d240e9b27046a05d0f5f6f8de42875a540e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,93,36,14,155,39,4,106,5,208,245,246,248,222,66,135,90,84,14,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
