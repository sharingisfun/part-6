I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\n\nThe clock is ticking and I can feel the weight of the final battle with the demon hordes looming over my head. The puzzle pieces are becoming clearer, but the casualty list is growing. And with each name that is added to those we've lost, my confidence cracks a little more.\n\nYet there is hope.\n\nA child saved.\n\nA life lost.\n\nA prophecy fulfilled.\n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00MBQASMQ\nPublished: September 9th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d19fdf9b031ac644f4391678dbb755b70b797791","amp;dn":"Wounded+%28Rylee+Adamson+%238%29+-+Shannon+Mayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d19fdf9b031ac644f4391678dbb755b70b797791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,159,223,155,3,26,198,68,244,57,22,120,219,183,85,183,11,121,119,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
