The Fall of Light continues to tell the tragic story of the downfall of an ancient realm, a story begun in the critically acclaimed Forge of Darkness.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a conflicted time in Kurald Galain, the realm of Darkness, where Mother Dark reigns. But this ancient land was once home to many a power... and even death is not quite eternal. The commonersâ€™ great hero, Vatha Urusander, is being promoted by his followers to take Mother Darkâ€™s hand in marriage, but her Consort, Lord Draconus, stands in the way of such ambitions. The impending clash sends fissures throughout the realm. As rumors of civil war burn through the masses, an ancient power emerges from the long dead seas. Caught in the middle of it all are the First Sons of Darkness, Anomander, Andarist, and Silchas Ruin of the Purake Hold...\r\n\r\nRead by Barnaby Edwards\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5daaa87c11c8cb1bedc1a5605458105d85e5af23","amp;dn":"Steven+Erikson+-+Fall+of+Light+%28The+Kharkanas+Trilogy+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5daaa87c11c8cb1bedc1a5605458105d85e5af23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,170,168,124,17,200,203,27,237,193,165,96,84,88,16,93,133,229,175,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
