Blackmon (Author)\nHardcover: 480 pages\nPublisher: Doubleday; First Edition edition (March 25, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385506252\nISBN-13: 978-0385506250\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: March 25, 2008\nIn this groundbreaking historical expose, Douglas A. Blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in American historyÃ¢â‚¬â€an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Age of NeoslaveryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that thrived from the aftermath of the Civil War through the dawn of World War II.Using a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Douglas A. Blackmon unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude shortly thereafter. By turns moving, sobering, and shocking, this unprecedented account reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. Wall Street Journal bureau chief Blackmon gives a groundbreaking and disturbing account of a sordid chapter in American historyÃ¢â‚¬â€the lease (essentially the sale) of convicts to commercial interests between the end of the 19th century and well into the 20th. Usually, the criminal offense was loosely defined vagrancy or even changing employers without permission. The initial sentence was brutal enough; the actual penalty, reserved almost exclusively for black men, was a form of slavery in one of hundreds of forced labor camps operated by state and county governments, large corporations, small time entrepreneurs and provincial farmers. Into this history, Blackmon weaves the story of Green Cottenham, who was charged with riding a freight train without a ticket, in 1908 and was sentenced to three months of hard labor for Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. Cottenham's sentence was extended an additional three months and six days because he was unable to pay fines then leveraged on criminals. Blackmon's book reveals in devastating detail the legal and commercial forces that created this neoslavery along with deeply moving and totally appalling personal testimonies of survivors. Every incident in this book is true, he writes; one wishes it were not so. (Mar.)\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A powerful and eye-opening account of a crucial but unremembered chapter of American history. BlackmonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnificent research paints a devastating picture of the ugly and outrageous practices that kept tens of thousands of black Americans enslaved until the onset of World War II. Slavery by Another Name is a passionate, highly impressive, and hugely important book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€David J.

The false imprisonment of black men has its history in an ignominious economic system that depended on coerced labor and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flinch from savagery toward fellow human beings. BlackmonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exhaustive reportage should put an end to the oft-repeated slander that black Americans tend toward lawlessness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Cynthia Tucker, editorial page editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and winner of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for commentary\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For those who think the conversation about race or exploitation in America is over, they should read Douglas BlackmonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cautionary tale, Slavery by Another Name.

The most important work of history published in a very long time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Bill Cosby\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“While much has been written about the horrors of slavery, Douglas BlackmonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well researched and powerfully written book reminds us of the ugly period of racial subjugation in America after the end of slavery.

It will challenge and change your understanding of what we were as Americans-and of what we are.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Chicago Tribune\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The genius of Blackmon's book is that it illuminates both the real human tragedy and the profoundly corrupting nature of the Old South slavery as it transformed to establish a New South social order.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A formidably researched, powerfully written, wrenchingly detailed narrative.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nA native of Leland, Mississippi, Doug Blackmon is the Wall Street Journal's Atlanta Bureau Chief.
