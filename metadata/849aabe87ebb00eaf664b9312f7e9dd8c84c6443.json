Frontman Chino Moreno paid tribute to his fallen bandmate by sharing an unreleased track called Ã¢â‚¬Å“SmileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, taken from Eros, the album the band was working on and ultimately shelved following ChengÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passing. \n\nA founding member of the hard-rock outfit, Cheng was involved in a car accident in November 2008, which left him in a semi-vegetative state for the remainder of his life. On April 13th, 2013, Cheng was taken to the hospital after his heart suddenly stopped and was pronounced dead shortly after.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849aabe87ebb00eaf664b9312f7e9dd8c84c6443","amp;dn":"Deftones+-+Smile+%5BSingle%5D%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849aabe87ebb00eaf664b9312f7e9dd8c84c6443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,154,171,232,126,187,0,234,246,100,185,49,47,126,157,216,200,76,100,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
