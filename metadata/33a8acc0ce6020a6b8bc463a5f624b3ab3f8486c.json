This set includes two CDs with 32 songs chosen from Berlin's collection of nearly 800 songs. These selections are perfectly suited for Fitzgerald's voice and her romantic sensibility; they are happy, occasionally sad, and full of swinging rhythm. A few of these songs -- &quot;Cheek to Cheek,&quot; &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz,&quot; and &quot;Blue Skies&quot; -- will be most familiar; others, &quot;Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails,&quot; &quot;Russian Lullaby,&quot; and &quot;All By Myself&quot; are as memorable but perhaps less known. Choices like &quot;Isn't This a Lovely Day?&quot; feature everything a listener would want in a song: intelligent lyrics, memorable melodies, and a strong emotional center. To say that Fitzgerald is in good voice for these recordings would be an understatement; her presentation here is simply regal.\n\nDisc 1:\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Let's Face The Music And Dance\n02 - You're Laughing At Me\n03 - Let Yourself Go\n04 - You Can Have Him\n05 - Russian Lullaby\n06 - Puttin' On The Ritz\n07 - Get Thee Behind Me Satan\n08 - Alexander's Ragtime Band\n09 - Top Hat, White Tie, And Tails\n10 - How About Me\n11 - Cheek To Cheek\n12 - I Used To Be Color Blind\n13 - Lazy\n14 - How Deep Is The Ocean\n15 - All By Myself\n16 - Remember\n\nDisc 2:\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
