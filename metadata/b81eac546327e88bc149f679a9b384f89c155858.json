Although group members were born in France, their parents were mostly gitanos, Spanish Romani people who fled Catalonia during the 1930s Spanish Civil War. Chico Bouchikhi is of Moroccan and Algerian descent. They are known for bringing Rumba Catalana, a pop-oriented music distantly derived from traditional flamenco music, to worldwide audiences.\n\nTheir music has a particular Rumba Flamenca style, with pop influences; many songs of the Gipsy Kings fit social dances, such as Salsa and Rumba. Their music has been described as a place where &quot;Spanish flamenco and Romani rhapsody meet salsa funk&quot;.[1]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81eac546327e88bc149f679a9b384f89c155858","amp;dn":"The+Gipsy+Kings-album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81eac546327e88bc149f679a9b384f89c155858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,30,172,84,99,39,232,139,193,73,246,121,169,179,132,248,156,21,88,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
