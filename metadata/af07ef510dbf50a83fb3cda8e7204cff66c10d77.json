The first written record dates to about 1610, with the publication of the &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; (The Fame of the Brotherhood), and Confessio Fraternitatis (The Confession of the Brotherhood), both possibly written by Francis Bacon. \n\nIn more modern times, groups claiming to be based on Rosicrucian principals can be divided into 3 basic groups: \n\n1... Esoteric Christian groups, who seek understanding of the hidden teachings of Christ. The &quot;Rosicrucian Fellowship&quot; is probably the best known of these groups.\n\n2... Masonic Rosicrucian groups, like the &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia&quot; (probably best known for the writings of AE Waite)\n\n3... Initiatory groups such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis.\n\nThere are a bewildering array of books available on the topic. The ones I selected here present a fairly accurate and well-balanced overview of the Rosicrucians. You may note that most of these are older titles. I feel that they are closer in time to the original teachings of the Rosicrucians, and so present a view less distorted.\n\n\nThis torrent contains...
