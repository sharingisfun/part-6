The defeat of the Shimazu at Sekigahara in 1600, and their need to win favor with the new ShMgun, led them to hatch an audacious plot to attack the islands on the ShMgun's behalf and bring back the king of Rykkyu as a hostage. Stephen Turnbull gives a blow-by-blow account of the operation, from the daring Shimazu amphibious landing, to their rapid advance overland, and the tactical feigned retreat that saw the Shimazu defeat the Okinawan army and kidnap their king in spectacular fashion. With a detailed background and specially commissioned artwork, the scene is set for a dramatic retelling of this fascinating raid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14915f6f8245d33b9a9f2e9d5e7f40b8952392d","amp;dn":"The+Samurai+Capture+a+King%3A+Okinawa+1609","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14915f6f8245d33b9a9f2e9d5e7f40b8952392d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,73,21,246,248,36,93,51,185,169,242,233,213,231,244,11,137,82,57,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
