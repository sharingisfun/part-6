Set first in Czechoslovakia, then in Switzerland, Kundera&amp;#039;s story tells the sometimes laborious story of a womanizing Czech surgeon forced to flee the Russian invasion and take on menial roles, giving his passion for the flesh a slighly different perspective, as he is no longer a doctor but just a window-washer. His relationship with this current female-of-choice, the interesting and puzzling Tereza, is at the center of the novel. Oliver is good, very good, pausing with great effect, having just the right amount of low-key drama and contemplative musing in his narration. He&amp;#039;s a good fit for a book that not everyone will like, but those who stay the course will generally be pleased they did.\n\naudio\naudiobook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd8151dd036bc6e698796106becc03b68b82b04e","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Milan+Kundera+-+The+Unbearable+Lightness+of+Being+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd8151dd036bc6e698796106becc03b68b82b04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,129,81,221,3,107,198,230,152,121,97,6,190,204,3,182,139,130,176,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
