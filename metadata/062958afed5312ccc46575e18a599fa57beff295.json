A whopping 200+ filters include 3D Objects such as Extruded Text, 3D particle effects, image restoration tools, lens flares and lights, keys and mattes, 3 Way Color Grading and other color correction tools, time-based effects such as Optical Stabilizer, warp and perspective effects, and blurs, glows, and cinematic effects. All filters take advantage of either multi-processing or OpenGL hardware acceleration for an interactive effects design experience.\n\nOver 1,000 professionally-designed presets are included free with every installation of BCC. You can save and freely share your own presets and build customized preset collections tuned to the specific needs of a project. Both static and animated BCC presets are supported on the After Effects platform. Presets can be shared with matching BCC installations on any host application in which BCC is installed.\n\nVia the Boris Transfer workflow utilities, BCC is the only plug-in collection that allows easy VFX migration between Adobe, Avid, and Apple video editing software ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with parameters and keyframed information intact. Boris Transfer AE allows you to transfer Avid or Final Cut Pro sequences to After Effects while Boris Transfer FCP gives you the ability to transfer sequences between Avid and Final Cut Pro.\n\nNew flicker reduction and videoscope tools, OpenGL hardware acceleration, 32-bit float support, deeper After Effects integration, and enhanced lens flares, particles, glows, and lights headline the new Version 8 release.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater, AE CS5 or CS 5.5\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062958afed5312ccc46575e18a599fa57beff295","amp;dn":"Boris+Continuum+Complete+v.+8.0.0+for+After+Effects+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062958afed5312ccc46575e18a599fa57beff295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,41,88,175,237,83,18,204,196,101,117,225,138,89,159,165,123,239,242,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
