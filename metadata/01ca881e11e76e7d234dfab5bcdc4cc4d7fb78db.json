Kruse, who used his findings to lose 140 pounds and pack on muscle, takes the reader through his prescriptions for obesity, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis, autoimmunity, brain health, and aging. The material weaves together surprises from our Ice Age origins with the new science of epigenetics, or the effect of diet and environment on gene expression.\n\nA champion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“biohacking,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the art of tinkering with oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own biology, Kruse pounces on his own professionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ineptness when it comes to chronic conditions and urges readers to take health care into their own hands. He discusses which labs to order and why, why your doctor is obligated to write you a prescription you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need, the vital roles daylight and darkness play in metabolism, and the optimal diet for different stages of health and different times of year.\n\nPerhaps KruseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more fascinating contributions to Paleo literature are his findings on cold therapyÃ¢â‚¬â€the effect of cold environments, immersion in cold water, and ice pack therapy on disease reversal, pain, and optimal living. Kruse explains how our origins as cold-adapted mammals hold the key to disease reversal, using a shocking biohack to prove his theory.\n\nThe Epi-paleo Rx is the result of KruseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abundant research and clinical application in his practice as a neurosurgeon. Kruse questions conventional wisdom about human metabolism and chronic disease, arguing science has incomplete information when it comes to insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and their related illnesses. By examining the human body through the prism of our early beginnings and the science of epigenetics, we find each of us already possesses the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to reverse disease and live optimally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01ca881e11e76e7d234dfab5bcdc4cc4d7fb78db","amp;dn":"Epi-paleo+Rx%2C+Jack+Kruse+Paleo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01ca881e11e76e7d234dfab5bcdc4cc4d7fb78db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,202,136,30,17,231,110,125,35,77,250,181,188,220,76,196,215,251,120,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
