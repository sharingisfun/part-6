The cover artwork was created by PÃƒÂ¤r Olofsson (IMMORTAL, DEMONAZ, EXODUS) and can be seen below.\n\nUNLEASHED's follow-up to 2012's &quot;Odalheim&quot; was once again produced by the band's guitarist, Fredrik Folkare, at his Chrome Studios in Stockholm.\n[img]http://assets.blabbermouth.net/media/unleashedband2015promo_638.jpg[/img]\nComments UNLEASHED frontman Johnny Hedlund: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The artwork represents the continuation of our previous album, which ended with 'The Great Battle Of Odalheim'. The battle took place at Uppsala fields in Sweden, and you can clearly see the 'kings graves' at the cover artwork, which is present at Uppsala also in the future. You can also see the bombed out church in the far distance. Then, of course, you see the place of Blot in the front and the rune stone with the runic symbol of courage of the new dawn.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dawn Of The Nine&quot; track listing:\n\n01. A New Day Will Rise\n02. They Came To Die\n03. Defenders Of Midgard\n04. Where Is Your God Now?\n05. The Bolt Thrower\n06. Let The Hammer Fly\n07. Where Churches Once Burned\n08. Land Of The Thousand Lakes\n09. Dawn Of The Nine\n10. Welcome The Son Of Thor!\n\nWith &quot;Odalheim&quot;, UNLEASHED not only presented the follow-up to &quot;As Yggdrasil Trembles&quot; in the year 2012, but also continued telling its post-doomsday story, embedded into the Norse mythology.\n\nAfter the mighty world tree Yggdrasil had trembled and rung in the end of the world, Fimbul winter followed: Three years of darkness and coldness, during which Mother Nature took back what was rightfully hers. This caused the end of life as we know it. RagnarÃƒÂ¶k. But the warriors who've survived will build a new world out of the old one's ashes. Right here, the story of &quot;Odalheim&quot; begins.\n\nUNLEASHED's current lineup:\n\nJohnny Hedlund: Bass, Vocals\nTomas MÃƒÂ¥sgard: Guitar\nFredrik Folkare: Guitar\nAnders Schultz: Drums\n\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
