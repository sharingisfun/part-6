If so, Advanced Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a powerful resource that can help you streamline your approach and overcome common hurdles that present in therapy.\n\nAt some point or another, you have probably encountered difficulty putting theory into practice when it comes to using ACT in sessions with clients. You arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t alone. Although ACT is a powerful treatment option for a number of psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, trauma, eating disorders, and more, it is a complex, ever-evolving model, and as such it can often be difficult to deliver effectively. The truth is that even the most seasoned ACT therapist will face challenges in their client sessions from time to time.\n\nThis is the only advanced professional ACT book on the market, and it is designed to help you close the gap between what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned in ACT training and your actual client sessions. Inside, licensed psychologist Darrah Westrup, PhD, provides valuable tips and real-life client scenarios to help you hone your understanding of the core processes behind ACT. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn practical strategies for moving past common barriers that can present during therapy, such as over-identifying with clients or difficulty putting theory into practice. Most importantly, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn when to deliver specific ACT components, and how to adapt your treatment for each client.\nThis user-friendly, pragmatic, and thoughtful guide does not promote Ã¢â‚¬Å“error-freeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ACT, but rather, ways to identify and work with the therapy process as it unfolds. A must-read for any therapist or mental health professional interested in sharpening their ACT skills.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b5695998167b39adbd5c35498184f875eeeaee8","amp;dn":"Advanced+Acceptance+and+Commitment+Therapy+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b5695998167b39adbd5c35498184f875eeeaee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,86,149,153,129,103,179,154,219,213,195,84,152,24,79,135,94,238,174,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
