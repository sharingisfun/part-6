It was their debut album and is also the only album on which Obituary used E standard guitar tuning - all of Obituary's other albums use D standard tuning. Despite this, it is widely considered as Obituary's heaviest album. It was re-released in 1997.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bfa858146b4c0b26d72fcc6df60ed8c9b52724b","amp;dn":"Obituary-Slowly+we+rot%2Bbonus+demo+tracks+1989+...320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bfa858146b4c0b26d72fcc6df60ed8c9b52724b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,250,133,129,70,180,192,178,109,114,252,198,223,96,237,140,155,82,114,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
