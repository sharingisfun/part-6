Provides 200 problems arranged in the approximate order and level of some commonly used linear algebra textbooks. Well-known theorems are excluded but expected to be used freely. Only a few problems need the Jordan canonical forms for their solutions. Hints and solutions are in the back, guarded only by the student's desire to learn.\n\n\n\nAuthor Info:\n===========\nFuzhen Zhang is a professor of mathematics at Nova Southeastern University. He is the author of Matrix Theory: Basic Results and Techniques and the editor of The Schur Complement and Its Applications.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4602019227b659a7c65b9dc5c95e7cb036c5e6f8","amp;dn":"Fuzhen+Zhang+-+Linear+Algebra%3A+Challenging+Problems+for+Studends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4602019227b659a7c65b9dc5c95e7cb036c5e6f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,2,1,146,39,182,89,167,198,91,157,197,201,94,124,176,54,197,230,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
