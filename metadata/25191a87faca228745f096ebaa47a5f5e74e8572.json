The show follows the actions of various characters in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and other Knights of the Jedi Order during the conflict, leading the clone trooper forces of the Galactic Republic against the battle droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Sith.\n\nThe series was produced by Cartoon Network Studios in association with Lucasfilm Ltd., and was aired both online and on Cartoon Network in 25 chapters from 2003 to 2005. The first two seasons, comprising Volume One, were produced in a two to three minute &quot;micro&quot; format, while season three was produced as fifteen minute episodes making up Volume Two. Both volumes were later released on home video edited as feature length films. Since release, it has received critical acclaim and was ranked 21 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.\n\nStar Wars: Clone Wars is part of the prequel storyline surrounding the fall of esteemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his subsequent transformation into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. With the series beginning in the year 22 BBY (twenty two years before the original film A New Hope), the Clone Wars have just begun, with the failing Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order under siege from the Confederacy of Independent Systems wishing to secede from Galactic society with the help of the Sith. As the war rages, more and more planets slip from Republic control. Both the Jedi and the Sith use a metaphysical power source known as the Force for a variety of purposes, however in different manners: the Jedi draw on the &quot;light&quot; side which is fueled by selflessness and compassion, while the Sith draw on the &quot;dark&quot; side which is fueled by primal urges such as greed and hate. It is set after Attack of the Clones, and ends immediately before Revenge of the Sith.\n\nVolume I/Season 1\n\nChapters 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20 of the series were released March 22, 2005, as &quot;Star Wars Clone Wars: Volume I&quot;. The episodes were edited together into one continuous feature. The set featured English subtitles, and commentary tracks on all the episodes, as well as art galleries, behind the scenes information, and the featurette &quot;Bridging the Saga: From Clone Wars to Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the Revenge of the Sith teaser trailer: with interviews of George Lucas, Genndy Tartakovsky, and the Clone Wars production crew. The disc also featured a glimpse of Star Wars: Clone Wars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Volume Two, an Episode III game trailer, and a playable level of the Xbox game Star Wars: Republic Commando.\n\nVolume II/Season 2\n\nChapters 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ25 of the micro-series were released on December 6, 2005. The release was an edited together compilation of the five chapters, similar to the Volume I release. The set featured English subtitles, and commentary tracks on all the episodes. Features included a Revenge of the Sith movie trailer, art galleries, trailers for the Star Wars games Battlefront II and Empire at War, an Xbox demo with two levels from Battlefront II, and the LEGO short film Revenge of the Brick. Also included was the featurette &quot;Connecting the Dots&quot;, which highlighted the creative process that Genndy Tartakovsky and his team used to link Clone Wars to Revenge of the Sith.\nThe second volume of Clone Wars series was released significantly later than the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith. According to Van Ling, the producer of both DVDs, the Volume II disc was released at such a late date due to an extremely tight schedule in producing the DVDs. According to http://starwars.com, both DVDs were produced at exactly the same time, but the Clone Wars DVD could not be finished in time for the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith. Ling apologized to fans for this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25191a87faca228745f096ebaa47a5f5e74e8572","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Clone+Wars+%5B2003%5D+Complete%2C+DVDRip%2C+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25191a87faca228745f096ebaa47a5f5e74e8572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,25,26,135,250,202,34,135,69,240,150,235,170,71,165,245,231,78,133,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
