Suppose he writes seven separate guides on the business of writing and publishing fiction, and puts them on sale for the price of a cup of coffee each. \n\nThen suppose this writer makes an omnibus edition of those guides available, and offers it at less than half the price you would pay for all seven. \n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what Michael Allen has done. First novel published in 1963, and still writing fiction, Michael has taken a year to write down everything that he has learnt in a literary lifetime. His intention has been to write practical, down-to-earth guides, for young and inexperienced writers, on all major aspects of the publishing scene. \n\nFifty years ago, when Michael first went looking for a publisher, there was precious little information available. So Michael has made it his business to compress everything he has learnt into these essential guides. And now the omnibus edition, containing all seven, is on sale. Over 125,000 words at a bargain price.
