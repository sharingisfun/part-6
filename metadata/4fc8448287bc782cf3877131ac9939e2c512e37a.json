This date sticks (with one exception) to high-quality jazz standards, some of which (&quot;Sippin at Bell's&quot;) are not performed all that often. Getz is particularly swinging on &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; and quite lyrical on Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Blood Count.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\n\nTrack list:\n01. On the Up and Up\n02. Blood Count\n03. Very Early\n04. Sipping at Bell's\n05. I Wish I Knew\n06. Come Rain or Come Shine\n07. Tempus Fugit\n\nPersonnel:\nStan Getz tenor saxophone\nJames McNeely piano\nMarc Johnson bass\nVictor Lewis drums\nBilly Hart drums (Billy Hart plays drums on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Very Early,&quot; Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Wish I KnewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come Rain or Come Shine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Victor Lewis plays drums on all others.)\n\nEnjoy and share!
